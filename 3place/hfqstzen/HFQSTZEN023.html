<h4 id="the-surprising-persuasiveness-of-a-sticky-note">7 The Surprising
Persuasiveness of a Sticky Note</h4>
<p>By Kevin Hogan</p>
<p>Imagine that you really need to convince someone to do something,
such as follow through on a task. You might be surprised to learn that
one of the best ways to get someone to comply with your request is
through a tiny nuance that adds a personal touch: attaching a sticky
note.</p>
<p>A brilliant set of experiments by Randy Garner at Sam Houston State
University in Huntsville, Texas, found that a) adding a personal touch,
and b) making someone feel like you’re asking a favor of them (and not
just anyone) can bring about impressive results when done in
tandem.1</p>
<p>The goal of Garner’s experiments was to see what was necessary to
generate compliance in completing surveys—which are often quite lengthy
and tedious—by fellow professors at the university, using only
interoffice mail as the conduit of communication. The wild card factor
in these experiments was the use of sticky notes. In one experiment, he
sent surveys to three separate groups of 50 professors (150 professors
total). Three groups received three different requests, as follows:</p>
<p>Group 1 received a survey with a sticky note attached asking for the
return of the completed survey.</p>
<p>Group 2 received a survey with the same handwritten message on the
cover letter instead of an attached sticky note.</p>
<p>Group 3 received a survey with a cover letter but no handwritten
message.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>Group 3: 36% of the professors returned the survey.</p>
<p>Group 2: 48% of the professors returned the survey.</p>
<p>Group 1: 76% of the professors returned the survey.</p>
<p>Generalizing this experiment in other contexts simply requires
understanding why the sticky note worked so well. It represents many
powerful behavioral triggers all in one little object:</p>
<p>It doesn’t match the environment: The sticky note takes up space and
looks a bit cluttered. The brain, therefore, wants it gone.</p>
<p>It gets attention first because of #1. It’s difficult to ignore.</p>
<p>It’s personalized. (That’s the difference between Group 2 and Group 3
in the experiment.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, the sticky note represents one person communicating with
another important person—almost as if it is a favor or special request,
which makes the recipient feel important.</p>
<p>Garner couldn’t help but explore the sticky note factor further. He
decided to do a second experiment where he sent a group of professors a
blank sticky note attached to one of the surveys. Here’s what
happened:</p>
<p>Group 1 received a survey with a personalized sticky note
message.</p>
<p>Group 2 received a survey with a blank sticky note attached.</p>
<p>Group 3 received a survey with no sticky note.</p>
<p>What happened in the second study?</p>
<p>Group 3: 34% returned the survey with no sticky note (similar to the
first experiment).</p>
<p>Group 2: 43% returned the survey with the blank sticky note</p>
<p>Group 1: 69% returned the survey with the personalized sticky note
(similar to the first experiment).</p>
<p>The real magic, it seems, is not the sticky note itself but the sense
of connection, meaning, and identity that the sticky note represents.
The person sending the survey is personally asking me in a special way
(not just writing it on the survey) to help him or her out.</p>
<p>But there’s more to compliance than just the result. There’s also the
speed of compliance and the quality of the effort. Garner experimented
to see how quickly people would return a follow-up survey if there was a
sticky note attached and also measured how much information the person
being surveyed returned if there was a sticky note attached versus the
group that received no sticky note. Here’s what he found:</p>
<p>Group 1 (with sticky note) returned their self-addressed stamped
envelopes (SASEs) and surveys within an average of about 4 days.</p>
<p>Group 2 (no sticky note) returned their SASEs and surveys in an
average of about 5-1/2 days.</p>
<p>But the most notable difference is that Group 1 also sent
significantly more comments and answered other open-ended questions with
more words than Group 2 did.</p>
<p>Further experiments revealed that if a task is easy to perform or
comply with, a simple sticky note request needs no further
personalization. But when the task is more involved, a more highly
personalized sticky note was significantly more effective than a simple
standard sticky note request. What makes it truly personal? Writing a
brief message is effective, but adding the person’s first name at the
top and your initials at the bottom causes significantly greater
compliance.</p>
<p>I’ve used this personalization theory with businesspeople around the
world to great success. For example, a mortgage broker I worked with
tested this approach in mailings, effectively doubling the number of
phone calls from people pursuing a loan with the broker. And it’s not
just effective at the office or with clients. The people you live with
are going to respond to the sticky note model as well. (Try sticking one
on the bathroom mirror and see what happens.)</p>
<p>Recently, the personalized sticky note has been put into digital form
for use in email, with mixed results. It’s most effective in email when
the two people have met or know each other. It had only a modest effect
in sales letters designed to make an immediate sale, when the reader
didn’t know the author of the sales letter. Using the notes in sales
letters designed for current clients and customers needs further
testing.</p>
<p>The next time you need colleagues to comply with a request, or the
next time you’re giving a potential client a portfolio to review, try
leaving a sticky note. A small personal touch will go a long way toward
getting the results you want.</p>
