<h4 id="how-resilience-works">1 How Resilience Works</h4>
<p>By Diane Coutu</p>
<p>When I began my career in journalism—I was a reporter at a national
magazine in those days—there was a man I’ll call Claus Schmidt. He was
in his mid-fifties, and to my impressionable eyes, he was the
quintessential newsman: cynical at times, but unrelentingly curious and
full of life, and often hilariously funny in a sandpaper-dry kind of
way. He churned out hard-hitting cover stories and features with a speed
and elegance I could only dream of. It always astounded me that he was
never promoted to managing editor.</p>
<p>But people who knew Claus better than I did thought of him not just
as a great newsman but as a quintessential survivor, someone who had
endured in an environment often hostile to talent. He had lived through
at least three major changes in the magazine’s leadership, losing most
of his best friends and colleagues on the way. At home, two of his
children succumbed to incurable illnesses, and a third was killed in a
traffic accident. Despite all this—or maybe because of it—he milled
around the newsroom day after day, mentoring the cub reporters, talking
about the novels he was writing—always looking forward to what the
future held for him.</p>
<p>Why do some people suffer real hardships and not falter? Claus
Schmidt could have reacted very differently. We’ve all seen that happen:
One person cannot seem to get the confidence back after a layoff;
another, persistently depressed, takes a few years off from life after
her divorce. The question we would all like answered is, Why? What
exactly is that quality of resilience that carries people through
life?</p>
<p>It’s a question that has fascinated me ever since I first learned of
the Holocaust survivors in elementary school. In college, and later in
my studies as an affiliate scholar at the Boston Psychoanalytic Society
and Institute, I returned to the subject. For the past several months,
however, I have looked on it with a new urgency, for it seems to me that
the terrorism, war, and recession of recent months have made
understanding resilience more important than ever. I have considered
both the nature of individual resilience and what makes some
organizations as a whole more resilient than others. Why do some people
and some companies buckle under pressure? And what makes others bend and
ultimately bounce back?</p>
<p>My exploration has taught me much about resilience, although it’s a
subject none of us will ever under stand fully. Indeed, resilience is
one of the great puzzles of human nature, like creativity or the
religious instinct. But in sifting through psychological research and in
reflecting on the many stories of resilience I’ve heard, I have seen a
little more deeply into the hearts and minds of people like Claus
Schmidt and, in doing so, looked more deeply into the human psyche as
well.</p>
<p>The buzz about resilience</p>
<p>Resilience is a hot topic in business these days. Not long ago, I was
talking to a senior partner at a respected consulting firm about how to
land the very best MBAs—the name of the game in that particular
industry. The partner, Daniel Savageau (not his real name), ticked off a
long list of qualities his firm sought in its hires: intelligence,
ambition, integrity, analytic ability, and so on. “What about
resilience?” I asked. “Well, that’s very popular right now,” he said.
“It’s the new buzzword. Candidates even tell us they’re resilient; they
volunteer the information. But frankly, they’re just too young to know
that about themselves. Resilience is something you realize you have
after the fact.”</p>
<p>“But if you could, would you test for it?” I asked. “Does it matter
in business?”</p>
<p>Savageau paused. He’s a man in his late forties and a success
personally and professionally. Yet it hadn’t been a smooth ride to the
top. He’d started his life as a poor French Canadian in Woonsocket,
Rhode Island, and had lost his father at six. He lucked into a football
scholarship but was kicked out of Boston University twice for drinking.
He turned his life around in his twenties, married, divorced, remarried,
and raised five children. Along the way, he made and lost two fortunes
before helping to found the consulting firm he now runs. “Yes, it does
matter,” he said at last. “In fact, it probably matters more than any of
the usual things we look for.” In the course of reporting this article,
I heard the same assertion time and again. As Dean Becker, the president
and CEO of Adaptiv Learning Systems, a four-year-old company in King of
Prussia, Pennsylvania, that develops and delivers programs about
resilience training, puts it: “More than education, more than
experience, more than training, a person’s level of resilience will
determine who succeeds and who fails. That’s true in the cancer ward,
it’s true in the Olympics, and it’s true in the boardroom.”</p>
<p>Academic research into resilience started about 40 years ago with
pioneering studies by Norman Garmezy, now a professor emeritus at the
University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. After studying why many children
of schizophrenic parents did not suffer psychological illness as a
result of growing up with them, he concluded that a certain quality of
resilience played a greater role in mental health than anyone had
previously suspected.</p>
<p>Today, theories abound about what makes resilience. Looking at
Holocaust victims, Maurice Vanderpol, a former president of the Boston
Psychoanalytic Society and Institute, found that many of the healthy
survivors of concentration camps had what he calls a “plastic shield.”
The shield was comprised of several factors, including a sense of humor.
Often the humor was black, but nonetheless it provided a critical sense
of perspective. Other core characteristics that helped included the
ability to form attachments to others and the possession of an inner
psychological space that protected the survivors from the intrusions of
abusive others. Research about other groups uncovered different
qualities associated with resilience. The Search Institute, a
Minneapolis-based nonprofit organization that focuses on resilience and
youth, found that the more resilient kids have an uncanny ability to get
adults to help them out. Still other research showed that resilient
inner-city youth often have talents such as athletic abilities that
attract others to them.</p>
<p>Many of the early theories about resilience stressed the role of
genetics. Some people are just born resilient, so the arguments went.
There’s some truth to that, of course, but an increasing body of
empirical evidence shows that resilience—whether in children, survivors
of concentration camps, or businesses back from the brink—can be
learned. For example, George Vaillant, the director of the Study of
Adult Development at Harvard Medical School in Boston, observes that
within various groups studied during a 60-year period, some people
became markedly more resilient over their lifetimes. Other psychologists
claim that unresilient people more easily develop resiliency skills than
those with head starts.</p>
<p>Most of the resilience theories I encountered in my research make
good common sense. But I also observed that almost all the theories
overlap in three ways. Resilient people, they posit, possess three
characteristics: a staunch acceptance of reality; a deep belief, often
buttressed by strongly held values, that life is meaningful; and an
uncanny ability to improvise. You can bounce back from hardship with
just one or two of these qualities, but you will only be truly resilient
with all three. These three characteristics hold true for resilient
organizations as well. Let’s take a look at each of them in turn.</p>
<p>Facing down reality</p>
<p>A common belief about resilience is that it stems from an optimistic
nature. That’s true but only as long as such optimism doesn’t distort
your sense of reality. In extremely adverse situations, rose-colored
thinking can actually spell disaster. This point was made poignantly to
me by management researcher and writer Jim Collins, who happened upon
this concept while researching Good to Great, his book on how companies
transform themselves out of mediocrity. Collins had a hunch (an exactly
wrong hunch) that resilient companies were filled with optimistic
people. He tried out that idea on Admiral Jim Stockdale, who was held
prisoner and tortured by the Vietcong for eight years.</p>
<p>Collins recalls: “I asked Stockdale: ‘Who didn’t make it out of the
camps?’ And he said, ‘Oh, that’s easy. It was the optimists. They were
the ones who said we were going to be out by Christmas. And then they
said we’d be out by Easter and then out by Fourth of July and out by
Thanksgiving, and then it was Christmas again.’ Then Stockdale turned to
me and said, ‘You know, I think they all died of broken hearts.’”</p>
<p>In the business world, Collins found the same unblinking attitude
shared by executives at all the most successful companies he studied.
Like Stockdale, resilient people have very sober and down-to-earth views
of those parts of reality that matter for survival. That’s not to say
that optimism doesn’t have its place: In turning around a demoralized
sales force, for instance, conjuring a sense of possibility can be a
very powerful tool. But for bigger challenges, a cool, almost
pessimistic, sense of reality is far more important.</p>
<p>Perhaps you’re asking yourself, “Do I truly understand—and accept—the
reality of my situation? Does my organization?” Those are good
questions, particularly because research suggests most people slip into
denial as a coping mechanism. Facing reality, really facing it, is
grueling work. Indeed, it can be unpleasant and often emotionally
wrenching. Consider the following story of organizational resilience,
and see what it means to confront reality.</p>
<p>Prior to September 11, 2001, Morgan Stanley, the famous investment
bank, was the largest tenant in the World Trade Center. The company had
some 2,700 employees working in the south tower on 22 floors between the
43rd and the 74th. On that horrible day, the first plane hit the north
tower at 8:46 a.m. and Morgan Stanley started evacuating just one minute
later, at 8:47 a.m. When the second plane crashed into the south tower
15 minutes after that, Morgan Stanley’s offices were largely empty. All
told, the company lost only seven employees despite receiving an almost
direct hit.</p>
<p>Of course, the organization was just plain lucky to be in the second
tower. Cantor Fitzgerald, whose offices were hit in the first attack,
couldn’t have done anything to save its employees. Still, it was Morgan
Stanley’s hard-nosed realism that enabled the company to benefit from
its luck. Soon after the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center, senior
management recognized that working in such a symbolic center of U.S.
commercial power made the company vulnerable to attention from
terrorists and possible attack.</p>
<p>With this grim realization, Morgan Stanley launched a program of
preparedness at the micro level. Few companies take their fire drills
seriously. Not so Morgan Stanley, whose VP of security for the
Individual Investor Group, Rick Rescorla, brought a military discipline
to the job. Rescorla, himself a highly resilient, decorated Vietnam vet,
made sure that people were fully drilled about what to do in a
catastrophe. When disaster struck on September 11, Rescorla was on a
bullhorn telling Morgan Stanley employees to stay calm and follow their
well-practiced drill, even though some building supervisors were telling
occupants that all was well. Sadly, Rescorla himself, whose life story
has been widely covered in recent months, was one of the seven who
didn’t make it out.</p>
<p>“When you’re in financial services where so much depends on
technology, contingency planning is a major part of your business,” says
President and COO Robert G. Scott. But Morgan Stanley was prepared for
the very toughest reality. It had not just one but three recovery sites
where employees could congregate and business could take place if work
locales were ever disrupted. “Multiple backup sites seemed like an
incredible extravagance on September 10,” concedes Scott. “But on
September 12, they seemed like genius.”</p>
<p>Maybe it was genius; it was undoubtedly resilience at work. The fact
is, when we truly stare down reality, we prepare ourselves to act in
ways that allow us to endure and survive extraordinary hardship. We
train ourselves how to survive before the fact.</p>
<p>The search for meaning</p>
<p>The ability to see reality is closely linked to the second building
block of resilience, the propensity to make meaning of terrible times.
We all know people who, under duress, throw up their hands and cry, “How
can this be happening to me?” Such people see themselves as victims, and
living through hardship carries no lessons for them. But resilient
people devise constructs about their suffering to create some sort of
meaning for themselves and others.</p>
<p>I have a friend I’ll call Jackie Oiseaux who suffered repeated
psychoses over a 10-year period due to an undiagnosed bipolar disorder.
Today, she holds down a big job in one of the top publishing companies
in the country, has a family, and is a prominent member of her church
community. When people ask her how she bounced back from her crises, she
runs her hands through her hair. “People sometimes say, ‘Why me?’ But
I’ve always said, ‘Why not me?’ True, I lost many things during my
illness,” she says, “but I found many more—incredible friends who saw me
through the bleakest times and who will give meaning to my life
forever.”</p>
<p>This dynamic of meaning making is, most researchers agree, the way
resilient people build bridges from present-day hardships to a fuller,
better-constructed future. Those bridges make the present manageable,
for lack of a better word, removing the sense that the present is
overwhelming. This concept was beautifully articulated by Viktor E.
Frankl, an Austrian psychiatrist and an Auschwitz survivor. In the midst
of staggering suffering, Frankl invented “meaning therapy,” a humanistic
therapy technique that helps individuals make the kinds of decisions
that will create significance in their lives.</p>
<p>In his book Man’s Search for Meaning, Frankl described the pivotal
moment in the camp when he developed meaning therapy. He was on his way
to work one day, worrying whether he should trade his last cigarette for
a bowl of soup. He wondered how he was going to work with a new foreman
whom he knew to be particularly sadistic. Suddenly, he was disgusted by
just how trivial and meaningless his life had become. He realized that
to survive, he had to find some purpose. Frankl did so by imagining
himself giving a lecture after the war on the psychology of the
concentration camp, to help outsiders understand what he had been
through. Although he wasn’t even sure he would survive, Frankl created
some concrete goals for himself. In doing so, he succeeded in rising
above the sufferings of the moment. As he put it in his book: “We must
never forget that we may also find meaning in life even when confronted
with a hopeless situation, when facing a fate that cannot be
changed.”</p>
<p>Frankl’s theory underlies most resilience coaching in business.
Indeed, I was struck by how often businesspeople referred to his work.
“Resilience training—what we call hardiness—is a way for us to help
people construct meaning in their everyday lives,” explains Salvatore R.
Maddi, a University of California, Irvine psychology professor and the
director of the Hardiness Institute in Newport Beach, California. “When
people realize the power of resilience training, they often say, ‘Doc,
is this what psychotherapy is?’ But psychotherapy is for people whose
lives have fallen apart badly and need repair. We see our work as
showing people life skills and attitudes. Maybe those things should be
taught at home, maybe they should be taught in schools, but they’re not.
So we end up doing it in business.”</p>
<p>Yet the challenge confronting resilience trainers is often more
difficult than we might imagine. Meaning can be elusive, and just
because you found it once doesn’t mean you’ll keep it or find it again.
Consider Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, who survived the war against the Nazis,
imprisonment in the gulag, and cancer. Yet when he moved to a farm in
peaceful, safe Vermont, he could not cope with the “infantile West.” He
was unable to discern any real meaning in what he felt to be the
destructive and irresponsible freedom of the West. Upset by his critics,
he withdrew into his farmhouse, behind a locked fence, seldom to be seen
in public. In 1994, a bitter man, Solzhenitsyn moved back to Russia.</p>
<p>Since finding meaning in one’s environment is such an important
aspect of resilience, it should come as no surprise that the most
successful organizations and people possess strong value systems. Strong
values infuse an environment with meaning because they offer ways to
interpret and shape events. While it’s popular these days to ridicule
values, it’s surely no coincidence that the most resilient organization
in the world has been the Catholic Church, which has survived wars,
corruption, and schism for more than 2,000 years, thanks largely to its
immutable set of values. Businesses that survive also have their creeds,
which give them purposes beyond just making money. Strikingly, many
companies describe their value systems in religious terms.
Pharmaceutical giant Johnson andandandand Johnson, for instance, calls
its value system, set out in a document given to every new employee at
orientation, the Credo. Parcel company UPS talks constantly about its
Noble Purpose.</p>
<p>Value systems at resilient companies change very little over the
years and are used as scaffolding in times of trouble. UPS Chairman and
CEO Mike Eskew believes that the Noble Purpose helped the company to
rally after the agonizing strike in 1997. Says Eskew: “It was a hugely
difficult time, like a family feud. Everyone had close friends on both
sides of the fence, and it was tough for us to pick sides. But what
saved us was our Noble Purpose. Whatever side people were on, they all
shared a common set of values. Those values are core to us and never
change; they frame most of our important decisions. Our strategy and our
mission may change, but our values never do.”</p>
<p>The religious connotations of words like “credo,” “values,” and
“noble purpose,” however, should not be confused with the actual content
of the values. Companies can hold ethically questionable values and
still be very resilient. Consider Phillip Morris, which has demonstrated
impressive resilience in the face of increasing unpopularity. As Jim
Collins points out, Phillip Morris has very strong values, although we
might not agree with them—for instance, the value of “adult choice.” But
there’s no doubt that Phillip Morris executives believe strongly in its
values, and the strength of their beliefs sets the company apart from
most of the other tobacco companies. In this context, it is worth noting
that resilience is neither ethically good nor bad. It is merely the
skill and the capacity to be robust under conditions of enormous stress
and change. As Viktor Frankl wrote: “On the average, only those
prisoners could keep alive who, after years of trekking from camp to
camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for existence; they were
prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal . . . in
order to save themselves. We who have come back . . . we know: The best
of us did not return.”</p>
<p>Values, positive or negative, are actually more important for
organizational resilience than having resilient people on the payroll.
If resilient employees are all interpreting reality in different ways,
their decisions and actions may well conflict, calling into doubt the
survival of their organization. And as the weakness of an organization
becomes apparent, highly resilient individuals are more likely to
jettison the organization than to imperil their own survival.</p>
<p>Ritualized ingenuity</p>
<p>The third building block of resilience is the ability to make do with
whatever is at hand. Psychologists follow the lead of French
anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss in calling this skill bricolage.1
Intriguingly, the roots of that word are closely tied to the concept of
resilience, which literally means “bouncing back.” Says Levi-Strauss:
“In its old sense, the verb bricoler . . . was always used with
reference to some extraneous movement: a ball rebounding, a dog
straying, or a horse swerving from its direct course to avoid an
obstacle.”</p>
<p>Bricolage in the modern sense can be defined as a kind of
inventiveness, an ability to improvise a solution to a problem without
proper or obvious tools or materials. Bricoleurs are always
tinkering—building radios from household effects or fixing their own
cars. They make the most of what they have, putting objects to
unfamiliar uses. In the concentration camps, for example, resilient
inmates knew to pocket pieces of string or wire whenever they found
them. The string or wire might later become useful—to fix a pair of
shoes, perhaps, which in freezing conditions might make the difference
between life and death.</p>
<p>When situations unravel, bricoleurs muddle through, imagining
possibilities where others are confounded. I have two friends, whom I’ll
call Paul Shields and Mike Andrews, who were roommates throughout their
college years. To no one’s surprise, when they graduated, they set up a
business together selling educational materials to schools, businesses,
and consulting firms. At first, the company was a great success, making
both founders paper millionaires. But the recession of the early 1990s
hit the company hard, and many core clients fell away. At the same time,
Paul experienced a bitter divorce and a depression that made it
impossible for him to work. Mike offered to buy Paul out but was instead
slapped with a lawsuit claiming that Mike was trying to steal the
business. At this point, a less resilient person might have just walked
away from the mess. Not Mike. As the case wound through the courts, he
kept the company going any way he could—constantly morphing the business
until he found a model that worked: going into joint ventures to sell
English-language training materials to Russian and Chinese companies.
Later, he branched off into publishing newsletters for clients. At one
point, he was even writing video scripts for his competitors. Thanks to
all this bricolage, by the time the lawsuit was settled in his favor,
Mike had an entirely different, and much more solid, business than the
one he had started with.</p>
<p>Bricolage can be practiced on a higher level as well. Richard
Feynman, winner of the 1965 Nobel Prize in physics, exemplified what I
like to think of as intellectual bricolage. Out of pure curiosity,
Feynman made himself an expert on cracking safes, not only looking at
the mechanics of safecracking but also cobbling together psychological
insights about people who used safes and set the locks. He cracked many
of the safes at Los Alamos, for instance, because he guessed that
theoretical physicists would not set the locks with random code numbers
they might forget but would instead use a sequence with mathematical
significance. It turned out that the three safes containing all the
secrets to the atomic bomb were set to the same mathematical constant,
e, whose first six digits are 2.71828.</p>
<p>Resilient organizations are stuffed with bricoleurs, though not all
of them, of course, are Richard Feynmans. Indeed, companies that survive
regard improvisation as a core skill. Consider UPS, which empowers its
drivers to do whatever it takes to deliver packages on time. Says CEO
Eskew: “We tell our employees to get the job done. If that means they
need to improvise, they improvise. Otherwise we just couldn’t do what we
do every day. Just think what can go wrong: a busted traffic light, a
flat tire, a bridge washed out. If a snowstorm hits Louisville tonight,
a group of people will sit together and discuss how to handle the
problem. Nobody tells them to do that. They come together because it’s
our tradition to do so.”</p>
<p>That tradition meant that the company was delivering parcels in
southeast Florida just one day after Hurricane Andrew devastated the
region in 1992, causing billions of dollars in damage. Many people were
living in their cars because their homes had been destroyed, yet UPS
drivers and managers sorted packages at a diversion site and made
deliveries even to those who were stranded in their cars. It was largely
UPS’s improvisational skills that enabled it to keep functioning after
the catastrophic hit. And the fact that the company continued on gave
others a sense of purpose or meaning amid the chaos.</p>
<p>Improvisation of the sort practiced by UPS, however, is a far cry
from unbridled creativity. Indeed, much like the military, UPS lives on
rules and regulations. As Eskew says: “Drivers always put their keys in
the same place. They close the doors the same way. They wear their
uniforms the same way. We are a company of precision.” He believes that
although they may seem stifling, UPS’s rules were what allowed the
company to bounce back immediately after Hurricane Andrew, for they
enabled people to focus on the one or two fixes they needed to make in
order to keep going.</p>
<p>Eskew’s opinion is echoed by Karl E. Weick, a professor of
organizational behavior at the University of Michigan Business School in
Ann Arbor and one of the most respected thinkers on organizational
psychology. “There is good evidence that when people are put under
pressure, they regress to their most habituated ways of responding,”
Weick has written. “What we do not expect under life-threatening
pressure is creativity.” In other words, the rules and regulations that
make some companies appear less creative may actually make them more
resilient in times of real turbulence.</p>
<p>Claus Schmidt, the newsman I mentioned earlier, died about five years
ago, but I’m not sure I could have interviewed him about his own
resilience even if he were alive. It would have felt strange, I think,
to ask him, “Claus, did you really face down reality? Did you make
meaning out of your hardships? Did you improvise your recovery after
each professional and personal disaster?” He may not have been able to
answer. In my experience, resilient people don’t often describe
themselves that way. They shrug off their survival stories and very
often assign them to luck.</p>
<p>Obviously, luck does have a lot to do with surviving. It was luck
that Morgan Stanley was situated in the south tower and could put its
preparedness training to work. But being lucky is not the same as being
resilient. Resilience is a reflex—a way of facing and understanding the
world—that is deeply etched into a person’s mind and soul. Resilient
people and companies face reality with staunchness, make meaning of
hardship instead of crying out in despair, and improvise solutions from
thin air. Others do not. This is the nature of resilience, and we will
never completely understand it.</p>
