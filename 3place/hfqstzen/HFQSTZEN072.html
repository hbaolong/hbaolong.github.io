<h4 id="the-founder-of-toms-on-reimagining-the-companys-mission">10 The
Founder of TOMS on Reimagining the Company’s Mission</h4>
<p>By Blake Mycoskie</p>
<p>In the fall of 2012 I did something I never thought I’d do: I took a
sabbatical from TOMS. It was not your typical travel-the-world
sabbatical. My wife, Heather, and I moved to Austin, Texas, where I’d
grown up, and I used the physical and psychological separation from the
company to do some soul-searching.</p>
<p>In the six years since I’d founded TOMS, it had grown from a startup
based in my Venice, California, apartment to a global company with more
than 00 million in revenue. I still owned 100% of it, and we were still
delivering on our promise to give a pair of shoes to someone in need for
every pair sold, but I felt disillusioned. My days were monotonous, and
I had lost my connection to many of the executives who were running
daily operations. What had once been my reason for being now felt like a
job.</p>
<p>During my months away, I did a lot of thinking about my personal
“why.” I knew why I had started the company and why people joined me in
the early days. And I still believed in our mission and the impact we
were making. But I was no longer sure why I wanted—or even if I did
want—to continue driving the business forward.</p>
<p>Eventually I came to a surprising conclusion: I felt lost because
TOMS had become more focused on process than on purpose. We were
concentrating so hard on the “what” and “how” of scaling up that we’d
forgotten our overarching mission, which is to use business to improve
lives. That is our greatest competitive advantage: It allows us to build
an emotional bond with customers and motivate employees, because they
know they are shopping and working for a movement bigger than
themselves.</p>
<p>After my time away from the business, I returned with renewed energy.
My mission was clear: Make TOMS a movement again.</p>
<p>The company’s genesis</p>
<p>I got the idea for TOMS on something like a sabbatical. After
founding and selling several companies (a door-to-door laundry business,
an outdoor advertising company, an online driver’s education service)
and making a brief detour into reality TV (I competed on The Amazing
Race with my sister and created an all-reality cable channel), I decided
to take some time off in 2006 to learn to play polo in Argentina. I know
that sounds like a strange mix of pursuits, but I’ve always been
happiest chasing my latest interest.</p>
<p>While in Buenos Aires, I met a woman who worked for a nonprofit,
delivering shoes to children in poor rural areas. She invited me to
accompany her, and the experience was truly life changing. In every town
we were greeted with cheers and tears. I met a pair of brothers, ages 10
and 12, who had been sharing a single pair of adult-size shoes. Because
the local schools required footwear, they had to take turns going to
class. Their mother wept when I handed her shoes that actually fit her
boys’ feet. I couldn’t believe that such a simple act could have such an
enormous impact on people’s lives.</p>
<p>I decided to do something more. Rather than go home and ask my
friends to donate their hand-me-downs or make financial contributions, I
would start a for-profit company based on the buy-one, give-one idea. I
named it Shoes for Tomorrow, later shortened to Tomorrow’s Shoes, and
finally to TOMS so that the name would fit on the little tag on our
shoes. (To this day, some people are puzzled when they meet me, because
they’re expecting a guy named Tom.)</p>
<p>My polo instructor, Alejo, and I persuaded a local shoemaker to help
us make a more fashionable version of the alpargata, a canvas shoe worn
by Argentines for a century. To borrow a term from Eric Ries’s The Lean
Startup, our first shoes were a “minimum viable product.” They had glue
stains on them, were in Argentine rather than U.S. sizes, and didn’t
always fit the same from pair to pair. But they were just good enough to
test the concept among my friends in Los Angeles. My goal was to sell
250 pairs so that I could give away 250 pairs in Argentina.</p>
<p>Back home, I hosted a dinner party for some women friends to get
their advice. They loved the shoes and were even more excited when I
shared my vision of helping children in need. They suggested a number of
local boutiques that might serve as retail outlets, so I went to one of
them, American Rag, and asked to speak with the shoe buyer. I knew my
shoes couldn’t compete on quality or price alone, so I told the buyer
why I wanted to sell them and give them away. The store became our first
retail account.</p>
<p>On a Saturday morning soon after that, I woke up to find my
BlackBerry vibrating. At the time, the TOMS website was set to email my
phone every time we made a sale. Usually it was just family and friends
placing orders, and the occasional buzzing was a nice surprise. But on
this day the phone kept buzzing . . . and buzzing . . . and buzzing. At
brunch I started flipping through the Los Angeles Times and saw that
what I’d expected would be a short piece by its fashion writer on TOMS
had landed on the front page of the Calendar section. By the end of the
day we had sold 2,200 pairs of shoes. This was incredible—but it was
also the company’s first supply-chain management challenge. We had fewer
than 200 pairs in my apartment.</p>
<p>Over the next six months I worked with a team of interns to turn my
“shoe project” into a real company. We received a flood of additional
press from Vogue, People, Time, Elle. Soon celebrities such as Tobey
Maguire, Keira Knightley, and Scarlett Johansson were being photographed
wearing TOMS. Nordstrom insisted on carrying our shoes. By the end of
the summer we had sold 10,000 pairs. The “why” of TOMS was clearly
resonating.</p>
<p>Disillusionment</p>
<p>By 2011 TOMS had an annual growth rate (for five years running) of
300%, and we’d recently given away our 10 millionth pair of shoes. The
one-for-one model—initially dismissed by traditional businesspeople as
nice but not financially sustainable—was clearly a success, and we’d
decided to extend it to eyewear, giving away pairs of glasses or medical
treatments to restore sight for pairs sold. We had set ourselves apart
in other ways, too: A third of our revenue was coming from
direct-to-consumer sales via our website, and we spent virtually nothing
on traditional advertising, relying instead on our 5 million social
media followers to create word-of-mouth buzz.</p>
<p>In September 2012 Heather and I got married. I’d brought in an
experienced team of executives to manage the day-to-day operations, and
for the first time since founding the business, I felt I could take a
break from it. I was relieved but also deeply unsettled. The excitement
and camaraderie of our startup was beginning to be replaced by a more
hierarchical culture. The leadership team was bogged down in personality
conflicts and bickering, with key members insisting that we implement
processes and systems similar to those used at their previous companies.
As an organization, we were so focused on protecting what we’d already
built that no one was thinking about new possibilities. I noticed that
longtime employees were starting to leave for more-entrepreneurial
organizations, and I realized that, secretly, I wanted to follow
them.</p>
<p>I’d started and sold companies before—but TOMS was different. It was
more than a company to me: It was my life. So this period of uncertainty
felt like having problems in a marriage. You thought you’d found your
business soul mate, but you’re not in love anymore. What do you do? For
me, the sabbatical was like going into couples counseling. I wasn’t
walking away; I was putting in the work to see if TOMS and I could
reconcile. If it had been a pure business problem, I would have
organized a strategic offsite. But this was both corporate and personal.
I needed to figure out the future course of the company and my role in
it. And I tend to do my best thinking alone.</p>
<p>When I left for Austin, I was careful not to make a big deal of it—I
told people the break was an extended honeymoon with Heather. But once
there, I dedicated a lot of time to private contemplation. I also
started talking to anyone I thought might offer good advice and inspire
me. I spoke regularly with my executive coach, entrepreneur friends, and
business and nonprofit leaders I admire. I traveled to conferences
around the country to learn from experts in social enterprise and
international development.</p>
<p>It was during this time that I read Simon Sinek’s fantastic book
Start with Why, which looks at leaders who inspire action, such as
Martin Luther King Jr., and companies, such as Apple, that create
products so compelling that fans will line up to buy them. Sinek argues
that one can build and sustain these movements only when leading with
the “why.” People follow you, buy from you, when they believe what you
believe.</p>
<p>The more I thought about this idea, the more I realized that TOMS had
veered away from its “why.” In the early days we always led with our
story: We weren’t selling shoes; we were selling the promise that each
purchase would directly and tangibly benefit a child who needed shoes.
But our desire to sustain the company’s hypergrowth had pushed us away
from that mission and into competing on the “what” and “how,” just as
every other shoe company does. In an effort to meet aggressive sales
goals, we had begun promoting deals and discounts on our
website—something we’d never done before. Our marketing increasingly
felt product focused rather than purpose focused. And as the leader of
TOMS, I was ultimately accountable for those mistakes. That was a tough
pill to swallow.</p>
<p>Another breakthrough came during a Dallas Cowboys game. I was
introduced to a man named Joe Ford, who told me that his son, Scott, was
also using business to improve lives, but through the coffee trade in
Rwanda. Joe explained the importance of water in the coffee supply
chain. When beans are processed with clean as opposed to dirty water,
they are transformed from a commodity to a specialty and can be sold at
dramatically higher prices. Scott’s company, Westrock Coffee, was
helping Rwandan growers build community-owned washing stations to
increase the value of their product and to prevent the spread of
waterborne disease. It was also buying direct from growers, helping to
break up unfair industry price controls, and offering low-interest loans
as an alternative to those from predatory lenders. Best of all, Westrock
was a profitable business that sold fantastic coffee.</p>
<p>After meeting Scott, I realized that a TOMS coffee venture could have
a real impact—and maybe lift me out of the funk I was in. Like most
entrepreneurs, I get a high from starting things and doing the
unexpected. No one doubted our shoe business anymore, but few people
would imagine that we could also sell coffee. And the expansion could
pave the way for a new TOMS retail experience, something I had long
wanted to try. We could create cafés and use them as community gathering
places to share ideas, get inspired, and connect guests with the “why”
of TOMS. The vision—and the challenge—pumped new life into me.</p>
<p>I told our senior executives about my idea. Like TOMS Shoes, TOMS
Roasting would have a one-for-one model: For every bag of coffee we
sold, we would provide a week’s worth of water to a person in need. When
they gave me the green light, I quickly assembled a small team of TOMS
employees to get the project (code-named “Burlap”) off the ground. I was
still living in Austin, but the more I discussed my plans with Heather
(an early TOMS employee who knew the business—and me—better than most
people), the more she realized it was time for my sabbatical to end.
We’d just bought a house, and we had a great group of friends, but in
early 2013 she said to me, “Blake, we need to move back to L.A.” If I
was going to fully recommit to TOMS, it couldn’t happen from afar.</p>
<p>The reentry</p>
<p>Coming back was great, but I quickly made some of the classic
mistakes that founders do upon rejoining their companies. First, when I
outlined my vision for using the coffee business to reinspire the “why”
of TOMS, I did so without a fully thought-out plan. That made some of my
coworkers anxious. Second, I asked the company’s CMO to step down so
that I could take over brand marketing and communications, which I
considered to be key pieces of our new direction—not only for
integrating the new business but also for reigniting the passion of our
customers. But I quickly realized that I’m better in the founder’s
role—setting the vision and traveling the country to communicate it, not
running marketing or any other department.</p>
<p>Despite these hiccups, by the end of 2013 we had launched the coffee
business nationally in Whole Foods stores, opened up three of our own
cafés, and started exploring international expansion. To date we have
provided more than 175,000 weeks of clean drinking water to people in
need around the world. The new product generated a ton of PR and got our
customers excited about TOMS again. But most important, I believe, it
gave our employees permission to think bigger, to challenge the status
quo, and to reconnect with the mission of the business.</p>
<p>It also got me thinking bigger. I realized that my ultimate aim was
to create the most influential, inspirational company in the world,
which would be possible only with more help. I decided to meet with
private equity firms that had a track record of helping entrepreneurial
companies into the next stage of growth, and after a thorough search, I
sold 50% of TOMS to Bain Capital in mid-2014. We clearly defined my role
and responsibilities and agreed to hire a world-class CEO.</p>
<p>The man we found, Jim Alling, embodies the core values of TOMS.
Although he scratched his head a bit over the “coffee decision” (he
spent much of his career in senior roles at Starbucks), he understood
what the move represented. Creating TOMS Roasting wasn’t an attempt to
compete with big chains but, rather, a bold move to reengage with the
community and help more people. Over the past year Jim has brought great
stability and strategic thinking to the business. We now also sell
handbags to fund safe births for mothers and babies in need and
backpacks to support anti-bullying programs.</p>
<p>As TOMS approaches its 10th anniversary, I feel more energized and
committed than ever. As far as we’ve come, I still see tremendous
opportunities to grow our movement. The “why” of TOMS—using business to
improve lives—is bigger than myself, the shoes we sell, or any future
products we might launch. It took going on a sabbatical to realize the
power of what we’ve created—and the best way for me to move it forward.
Now that I have a clear purpose and amazing partners supporting me, I’m
ready for the company’s next 10 years and the many adventures ahead.</p>
