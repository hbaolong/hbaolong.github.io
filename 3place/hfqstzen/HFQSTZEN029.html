<h4 id="creating-sustainable-performance">5 Creating Sustainable
Performance</h4>
<p>By Gretchen Spreitzer and Christine Porath</p>
<p>When the economy’s in terrible shape, when any of us is lucky to have
a job—let alone one that’s financially and intellectually
rewarding—worrying about whether or not your employees are happy might
seem a little over the top. But in our research into what makes for a
consistently high-performing workforce, we’ve found good reason to care:
Happy employees produce more than unhappy ones over the long term. They
routinely show up at work, they’re less likely to quit, they go above
and beyond the call of duty, and they attract people who are just as
committed to the job. Moreover, they’re not sprinters; they’re more like
marathon runners, in it for the long haul.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to be happy in your job? It’s not about
contentment, which connotes a degree of complacency. When we and our
research partners at the Ross School of Business’s Center for Positive
Organizational Scholarship started looking into the factors involved in
sustainable individual and organizational performance, we found a better
word: thriving. We think of a thriving workforce as one in which
employees are not just satisfied and productive but also engaged in
creating the future—the company’s and their own. Thriving employees have
a bit of an edge: They are highly energized—but they know how to avoid
burnout.</p>
<p>Across industries and job types, we found that people who fit our
description of thriving demonstrated 16% better overall performance (as
reported by their managers) and 125% less burnout (self-reported) than
their peers. They were 32% more committed to the organization and 46%
more satisfied with their jobs. They also missed much less work and
reported significantly fewer doctor visits, which meant health care
savings and less lost time for the company.</p>
<p>We’ve identified two components of thriving. The first is vitality:
the sense of being alive, passionate, and excited. Employees who
experience vitality spark energy in themselves and others. Companies
generate vitality by giving people the sense that what they do on a
daily basis makes a difference.</p>
<p>The second component is learning: the growth that comes from gaining
new knowledge and skills. Learning can bestow a technical advantage and
status as an expert. Learning can also set in motion a virtuous cycle:
People who are developing their abilities are likely to believe in their
potential for further growth.</p>
<p>The two qualities work in concert; one without the other is unlikely
to be sustainable and may even damage performance. Learning, for
instance, creates momentum for a time, but without passion it can lead
to burnout. What will I do with what I’ve learned? Why should I stick
with this job? Vitality alone—even when you love the kudos you get for
delivering results—can be deadening: When the work doesn’t give you
opportunities to learn, it’s just the same thing over and over
again.</p>
<p>The combination of vitality and learning leads to employees who
deliver results and find ways to grow. Their work is rewarding not just
because they successfully perform what’s expected of them today but also
because they have a sense of where they and the company are headed. In
short, they are thriving, and the energy they create is contagious. (See
the sidebar “About the Research.”)</p>
<p>ABOUT THE RESEARCH</p>
<p>Over the past seven years, we have been researching the nature of
thriving in the workplace and the factors that enhance or inhibit
it.</p>
<p>Across several studies with our colleagues Cristina Gibson and
Flannery Garnett, we surveyed or interviewed more than 1,200 white- and
blue-collar employees in an array of industries, including higher
education, health care, financial services, maritime, energy, and
manufacturing. We also studied metrics reflecting energy, learning, and
growth, based on information supplied by employees and bosses, along
with retention rates, health, overall job performance, and
organizational citizenship behaviors.</p>
<p>We developed a definition of thriving that breaks the concept into
two factors: vitality—the sense that you’re energized and alive; and
learning—the gaining of knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>When you put the two together, the statistics are striking. For
example, people who were high energy and high learning were 21% more
effective as leaders than those who were only high energy. The outcomes
on one measure in particular—health—were even more extreme. Those who
were high energy and low learning were 54% worse when it came to health
than those who were high in both.</p>
<p>How organizations can help employees thrive</p>
<p>Some employees thrive no matter the context. They naturally build
vitality and learning into their jobs, and they inspire the people
around them. A smart hiring manager will look for those people. But most
employees are influenced by their environment. Even those predisposed to
flourish can fold under pressure.</p>
<p>The good news is that—without heroic measures or major financial
investments—leaders and managers can jump-start a culture that
encourages employees to thrive. That is, managers can overcome
organizational inertia to promote thriving and the productivity that
follows it—in many cases with a relatively modest shift in
attention.</p>
<p>Ideally, you’d be blessed with a workforce full of people who
naturally thrive. But there’s a lot you can do to release and sustain
enthusiasm. Our research has uncovered four mechanisms that create the
conditions for thriving employees: providing decision-making discretion,
sharing information, minimizing incivility, and offering performance
feedback. The mechanisms overlap somewhat. For instance, if you let
people make decisions but give them incomplete information, or leave
them exposed to hostile reactions, they’ll suffer rather than thrive.
One mechanism by itself will get you part of the way, but all four are
necessary to create a culture of thriving. Let’s look at each in
turn.</p>
<p>Providing decision-making discretion</p>
<p>Employees at every level are energized by the ability to make
decisions that affect their work. Empowering them in this way gives them
a greater sense of control, more say in how things get done, and more
opportunities for learning.</p>
<p>The airline industry might seem like an unlikely place to find
decision-making discretion (let alone a thriving workforce), but
consider one company we studied, Alaska Airlines, which created a
culture of empowerment that has contributed to a major turnaround over
the past decade. In the early 2000s the airline’s numbers were flagging,
so senior management launched the 2010 Plan, which explicitly invited
employee input into decisions that would improve service while
maintaining a reputation for timely departures. Employees were asked to
set aside their current perceptions of “good” service and consider new
ways to contribute, coming up with ideas that could take service from
good to truly great. Agents embraced the program, which gave them, for
instance, the discretion to find solutions for customers who had missed
flights or were left behind for any other reason. Ron Calvin, the
director of the eastern region, told us of a call he had recently
received on his cell phone from a customer he hadn’t seen or spoken to
since working at the Seattle airport, five years earlier. The customer
had a three-month-old grandchild who had just gone into cardiac arrest.
The grandparents were trying to get back to Seattle from Honolulu.
Everything was booked. Ron made a few calls and got them on a flight
right away. That day the grandfather sent Ron a text saying, simply, “We
made it.”</p>
<p>Efforts like this to meet individual needs without holding up flights
have led to a number one rating for on-time performance and a full
trophy case. The airline has also expanded considerably into new
markets, including Hawaii, the Midwest, and the East Coast.</p>
<p>Southwest is a better-known story, largely because of the company’s
reputation for having a fun and caring culture. Flight attendants are
often eager to sing, joke around, and in general entertain customers.
They also radiate energy and a passion for learning. One decided to
offer the preflight safety instructions in rap format. He was motivated
to put his special talents to work, and the passengers loved it,
reporting that it was the first time they had actually paid attention to
the instructions.</p>
<p>At Facebook, decision-making discretion is fundamental to the
culture. One employee posted a note on the site expressing his surprise,
and pleasure, at the company’s motto, “Move fast and break things,”
which encourages employees to make decisions and act. On just his second
day of work, he found a fix to a complicated bug. He expected some sort
of hierarchical review, but his boss, the vice president of product,
just smiled and said, “Ship it.” He marveled that so early on he had
delivered a solution that would instantly reach millions of people.</p>
<p>The challenge for managers is to avoid cutting back on empowerment
when people make mistakes. Those situations create the best conditions
for learning—not only for the parties concerned but also for others, who
can learn vicariously.</p>
<p>Sharing information</p>
<p>Doing your job in an information vacuum is tedious and uninspiring;
there’s no reason to look for innovative solutions if you can’t see the
larger impact. People can contribute more effectively when they
understand how their work fits with the organization’s mission and
strategy.</p>
<p>Alaska Airlines has chosen to invest management time in helping
employees gain a broad view of the company’s strategy. The 2010 Plan was
launched with traditional communications but also with a months-long
road show and training classes designed to help employees share ideas.
The CEO, the president, and the COO still go on the road quarterly to
gather information about the idiosyncrasies of various markets; they
then disseminate what they’ve learned. The benefits show up in yearly
measures of employee pride in the company—now knocking it out of the
park at 90%.</p>
<p>At Zingerman’s (an Ann Arbor, Michigan, community of food-related
businesses that has worked closely with Wayne Baker, a colleague of ours
at the Center for Positive Organizational Scholarship), information is
as transparent as possible. The organization had never consciously
withheld its numbers—financial information was tacked up for employees
to see—but when cofounders Ari Weinzweig and Paul Saginaw studied open
book management in the mid-1990s, they came to believe that employees
would show more interest if they got involved in the “game.”</p>
<p>Implementation of a more formal and meaningful open book policy was
not easy. People could look at the numbers, but they had little reason
to pay attention and didn’t get much insight into how the data related
to their daily work. For the first five or six years, the company
struggled to build the concept into its systems and routines and to wrap
people’s minds around what Baker calls “the rigor of the huddle”: weekly
gatherings around a whiteboard at which teams track results, “keep
score,” and forecast the next week’s numbers. Although people understood
the rules of open book management, at first they didn’t see the point of
adding yet another meeting to their busy schedules. It wasn’t until
senior leaders made huddling non-negotiable that employees grasped the
true purpose of the whiteboards, which displayed not just financial
figures but also service and food quality measures, check averages,
internal satisfaction figures, and “fun,” which could mean anything from
weekly contests to customer satisfaction ratings to employees’ ideas for
innovation.</p>
<p>Some Zingerman’s businesses began instituting “mini games”:
short-term incentives to find a problem or capitalize on an opportunity.
For instance, the staff at Zingerman’s Roadhouse restaurant used the
greeter game to track how long it took for customers to be greeted.
“Ungreeted” customers expressed less satisfaction, and employees found
themselves frequently comping purchases to make up for service lapses.
The greeter game challenged the host team to greet every customer within
five minutes of being seated, with a modest financial reward for 50
straight days of success. It inspired hosts to quickly uncover and fill
holes in the service process. Service scores improved considerably over
the course of a month. Other Zingerman’s businesses started similar
games, with incentives for faster delivery, fewer knife injuries in the
bakery (which would lower insurance costs), and neater kitchens.</p>
<p>The games have naturally created some internal tensions by delivering
the bad news along with the good, which can be demoralizing. But overall
they have greatly increased frontline employees’ sense of ownership,
contributing to better performance. From 2000 to 2010 Zingerman’s
revenue grew by almost 300%, to more than 5 million. The company’s
leaders credit open book management as a key factor in that success.</p>
<p>Simple anecdotes lend credence to their claim. For instance, a couple
of years ago we saw Ari Weinzweig give a talk at the Roadhouse. A guest
asked him whether it was realistic to expect the average waiter or
busboy to understand company strategy and finance. In response, Ari
turned to a busboy, who had been oblivious to the conversation: Would
the teenager mind sharing Zingerman’s vision and indicating how well the
restaurant was meeting its weekly goals? Without batting an eye, the
busboy stated the vision in his own words and then described how well
the restaurant was doing that week on “meals sent back to the
kitchen.”</p>
<p>While Zingerman’s is a fairly small business, much larger ones—such
as Whole Foods and the transportation company YRC Worldwide—have also
adopted open book management. Systems that make information widely
available build trust and give employees the knowledge they need to make
good decisions and take initiative with confidence.</p>
<p>Minimizing incivility</p>
<p>The costs of incivility are great. In our research with Christine
Pearson, a professor at Arizona State University’s Thunderbird School of
Global Management, we discovered that half of employees who had
experienced uncivil behavior at work intentionally decreased their
efforts. More than a third deliberately decreased the quality of their
work. Two-thirds spent a lot of time avoiding the offender, and about
the same number said their performance had declined.</p>
<p>Most people have experienced rude behavior at work. Here are a few
quotes from our research:</p>
<p>“My boss asked me to prepare an analysis. This was my first project,
and I was not given any instructions or examples. He told me the
assignment was crap.”</p>
<p>“My boss said, ‘If I wanted to know what you thought, I’d ask
you.’”</p>
<p>“My boss saw me remove a paper clip from some documents and drop it
in my wastebasket. In front of my 12 subordinates he rebuked me for
being wasteful and required me to retrieve it.”</p>
<p>“On speakerphone, in front of peers, my boss told me that I’d done
‘kindergarten work.’”</p>
<p>We have heard hundreds of stories, and they’re sadly familiar to most
working people. But we don’t hear so much about the costs.</p>
<p>Incivility prevents people from thriving. Those who have been the
targets of bad behavior are often, in turn, uncivil themselves: They
sabotage their peers. They “forget” to copy colleagues on memos. They
spread gossip to deflect attention. Faced with incivility, employees are
likely to narrow their focus to avoid risks—and lose opportunities to
learn in the process.</p>
<p>A management consultancy we studied, Caiman Consulting, was founded
as an alternative to the larger firms. Headquartered in Redmond,
Washington, in offices that are not particularly sleek, the firm is
recognized for its civil culture. Background checks in its hiring
process include a candidate’s record of civility.</p>
<p>“People leave a trail,” says Caiman’s director, Greg Long. “You can
save yourself from a corrosive culture by being careful and
conscientious up front.” The managing director, Raazi Imam, told us, “I
have no tolerance for anyone to berate or disrespect someone.” When it
does happen, he pulls the offender aside to make his policy clear. Long
attributes the firm’s 95% retention rate to its culture.</p>
<p>Caiman passes up highly qualified candidates who don’t match that
culture. It also keeps a list of consultants who might be good hires
when an appropriate spot opens up. The HR director, Meg Clara, puts
strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence among her prime
criteria for candidates.</p>
<p>At Caiman, as at all companies, managers establish the tone when it
comes to civility. A single bad player can set the culture awry. One
young manager told us about her boss, an executive who had a habit of
yelling from his office “You made a mistake!” for a sin as minor as a
typo. His voice would resonate across the floor, making everyone cringe
and the recipient feel acutely embarrassed. Afterward, colleagues would
gather in a common area for coffee and commiseration. An insider told us
that those conversations focused not on how to get ahead at the company
or learn to cope by developing a thick skin but on how to get even and
get out.</p>
<p>In our research, we were surprised by how few companies consider
civility—or incivility—when evaluating candidates. Corporate culture is
inherently contagious; employees assimilate to their environment. In
other words, if you hire for civility, you’re more likely to breed it
into your culture. (See the sidebar “Individual Strategies for
Thriving.”)</p>
<p>INDIVIDUAL STRATEGIES FOR THRIVING</p>
<p>Although organizations benefit from enabling employees to thrive,
leaders have so much on their plates that attention to this important
task can slip. However, anyone can adopt strategies to enhance learning
and vitality without significant organizational support. And because
thriving can be contagious, you may find your ideas quickly
spreading.</p>
<p>Take a break</p>
<p>Research by Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz has shown that breaks and
other renewal tactics, no matter how small, can create positive
energy.</p>
<p>In our teaching, we let students design regular breaks and activities
into the class to ensure that they stay energized. In one term, students
decided to halt every class for two minutes at the midpoint to get up
and do something active. Each week a different foursome designed the
quick activity—watching a funny YouTube video, doing the cha-cha slide,
or playing a game. The point is that the students figure out what is
energizing for them and share it with the class.</p>
<p>Even if your organization doesn’t offer formal mechanisms for
renewal, it’s nearly always possible to schedule a short walk, a bike
ride, or a quick lunch in the park. Some people write it into their
schedules so that meetings can’t impinge.</p>
<p>Craft your own work to be more meaningful</p>
<p>You can’t ignore the requirements of your job, but you can watch for
opportunities to make it more meaningful. Consider Tina, the staff
administrator of a policy think tank within a large organization. When
her boss took a six-month sabbatical, Tina needed to find a short-term
replacement project. After some scouting, she uncovered a budding
initiative to develop staff members’ ability to speak up with their
ideas about the organization. The effort needed an innovative spirit to
kick it off. The pay was lower, but the nature of the work energized
Tina. When her boss returned, she renegotiated the terms of her think
tank job to consume only 80% of her time, leaving the rest for the staff
development project.</p>
<p>Look for opportunities to innovate and learn</p>
<p>Breaking out of the status quo can trigger the learning that is so
essential to thriving. When Roger became the head of a prestigious high
school in the Midwest, he was brimming with innovative ideas. He quickly
ascertained, however, that quite a few staff members were not open to
new ways of doing things. He made sure to listen to their concerns and
tried to bring them along, but he invested more of his effort in the
growth and learning of those who shared his passion for breakthrough
ideas. Mentoring and encouraging them, Roger began to achieve small
wins, and his initiatives gained some momentum. A few of the resisters
ended up leaving the school, and others came around when they saw signs
of positive change. By focusing on those bright spots rather than the
points of resistance, Roger was able to launch an effort that is
propelling the school toward a radically different future.</p>
<p>Invest in relationships that energize you</p>
<p>All of us have colleagues who may be brilliant but are difficult and
corrosive to work with. Individuals who thrive look for opportunities to
work closely with colleagues who generate energy and to minimize
interaction with those who deplete it. In fact, when we built the
research team to study thriving, we chose colleagues we enjoyed, who
energized us, with whom we looked forward to spending time, and from
whom we knew we could learn. We seek to build good relationships by
starting every meeting with good news or expressions of gratitude.</p>
<p>Recognize that thriving can spill over outside the office</p>
<p>There’s evidence that high levels of engagement at work will not
lessen your ability to thrive in your personal life but instead can
enhance it. When one of us (Gretchen) was dealing with her husband’s
difficult medical diagnosis, she found that her work, even though it was
demanding, gave her the energy to thrive professionally and in her
family life. Thriving is not a zero-sum game. People who feel energized
at work often bring that energy to their lives beyond work. And people
inspired by outside activities—volunteering, training for a race, taking
a class—can bring their drive back to the office.</p>
<p>Offering performance feedback</p>
<p>Feedback creates opportunities for learning and the energy that’s so
critical for a culture of thriving. By resolving feelings of
uncertainty, feedback keeps people’s work-related activities focused on
personal and organizational goals. The quicker and more direct the
feedback, the more useful it is.</p>
<p>The Zingerman’s huddle, described earlier, is a tool for sharing
near-real-time information about individual as well as business
performance. Leaders outline daily ups and downs on the whiteboard, and
employees are expected to “own” the numbers and come up with ideas for
getting back on track when necessary. The huddles also include “code
reds” and “code greens,” which document customer complaints and
compliments so that all employees can learn and grow on the basis of
immediate and tangible feedback.</p>
<p>Quicken Loans, a mortgage finance company that measures and rewards
employee performance like no other organization, offers continually
updated performance feedback using two types of dashboards: a ticker and
kanban reports. (Kanban, a Japanese word meaning “signal,” is used
frequently in operations.)</p>
<p>The ticker has several panels that display group and individual
metrics along with data feeds that show how likely an employee is to
meet his or her daily goals. People are hardwired to respond to scores
and goals, so the metrics help keep them energized through the day;
essentially, they’re competing against their own numbers.</p>
<p>The kanban dashboard allows managers to track people’s performance so
that they know when an employee or a team needs some coaching or other
type of assistance. A version of the kanban chart is also displayed on
monitors, with a rotating list of the top 15 salespeople for each
metric. Employees are constantly in competition to make the boards,
which are almost like a video game’s ranking of high scorers.</p>
<p>Employees could feel overwhelmed or even oppressed by the constant
nature of the feedback. Instead, the company’s strong norms for civility
and respect and for giving employees a say in how they accomplish their
work create a context in which the feedback is energizing and promotes
growth.</p>
<p>The global law firm O’Melveny andandandand Myers lauds the use of
360-degree evaluations in helping workers thrive. The feedback is
open-ended and summarized rather than shared verbatim, which has
encouraged a 97% response rate. Carla Christofferson, the managing
partner of the Los Angeles offices, learned from her evaluation that
people saw her behavior as not matching the firm’s stated commitment to
work-life balance—which was causing stress among employees. She started
to spend more time away from the office and to limit weekend work to
things she could do at home. She became a role model for balance, which
went a long way toward eliminating the worry of employees who wanted a
life outside of work.</p>
<p>The four mechanisms that help employees thrive don’t require enormous
efforts or investments. What they do require is leaders who are open to
empowering employees and who set the tone. As we’ve noted, each
mechanism provides a different angle that’s necessary for thriving. You
can’t choose one or two from the menu; the mechanisms reinforce one
another. For example, can people be comfortable making decisions if they
don’t have honest information about current numbers? Can they make
effective decisions if they’re worried about being ridiculed?</p>
<p>Creating the conditions for thriving requires your concerted
attention. Helping people grow and remain energized at work is valiant
on its own merits—but it can also boost your company’s performance in a
sustainable way.</p>
