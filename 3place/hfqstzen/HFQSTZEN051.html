<h4 id="the-secret-to-dealing-with-difficult-people-its-about-you">3 The
Secret to Dealing with Difficult People: It’s About You</h4>
<p>By Tony Schwartz</p>
<p>Do you have someone at work who consistently triggers you? Doesn’t
listen? Takes credit for work you’ve done? Wastes your time with trivial
issues? Acts like a know-it-all? Can only talk about himself? Constantly
criticizes?</p>
<p>Our core emotional need is to feel valued and valuable. When we
don’t, it’s deeply unsettling, a challenge to our sense of equilibrium,
security, and well-being. At the most primal level, it can feel like a
threat to our very survival.</p>
<p>This is especially true when the person you’re struggling with is
your boss. The problem is that being in charge of other people rarely
brings out the best in us.</p>
<p>“Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,”
Lord Acton said way back in 1887. “There is no worse heresy than the
office that sanctifies the holder of it.”</p>
<p>The easy default when we feel devalued is to play the role of victim,
and it’s a seductive pull. Blaming others for how we’re feeling is a
form of self-protection. Whatever is going wrong isn’t our fault. By
off-loading responsibility, we feel better in the short term.</p>
<p>The problem with being a victim is that you cede the power to
influence your circumstances. The painful truth when it comes to the
people who trigger you is this: You’re not going to change them. The
only person you have the possibility of changing is yourself.</p>
<p>Each of us has a default lens through which we see the world. We call
it reality, but in fact it’s a selective filter. We have the power to
view the world through other lenses. There are three worth trying on
when you find yourself defaulting to negative emotions.</p>
<p>The lens of realistic optimism. Using this lens requires asking
yourself two simple questions when you feel you’re being treated badly
or unfairly. The first one is, “What are the facts in this situation?”
The second is, “What’s the story I’m telling myself about those
facts?”</p>
<p>Making this distinction allows you to stand outside your experience
rather than simply reacting to it. It also opens the possibility that
whatever story you’re currently telling yourself isn’t necessarily the
only way to look at your situation.</p>
<p>Realistic optimism, a term coined by the psychologist Sandra
Schneider, means telling yourself the most hopeful and empowering story
about a given circumstance without subverting the facts. It’s about
moving beyond your default reaction to feel under attack and exploring
whether there is an alternative way of viewing the situation that would
ultimately serve you better. Another way of discovering an alternative
is to ask yourself, “How would I act here at my best?”</p>
<p>The reverse lens. This lens requires viewing the world through the
lens of the person who triggered you. It doesn’t mean sacrificing your
own point of view but rather widening your perspective.</p>
<p>It’s nearly certain that the person you perceive as difficult views
the situation differently than you do. With the reverse lens, you ask
yourself, “What is this person feeling, and in what ways does that make
sense?” Or put more starkly: “Where’s my responsibility in all
this?”</p>
<p>Counterintuitively, one of the most powerful ways to reclaim your
value, when it feels threatened, is to find a way to appreciate the
perspective of the person you feel devalued by. It’s called empathy.</p>
<p>Just as you do, others tend to behave better when they feel seen and
valued—especially since insecurity is what usually prompts them to act
badly in the first place.</p>
<p>The long lens. Sometimes your worst fears about another person turn
out to be true. He is someone who bullies you unreasonably, and seeing
it from his perspective doesn’t help. She does invariably take credit
for your work.</p>
<p>When your current circumstances are incontrovertibly bad, the long
lens provides a way of looking beyond the present to imagine a better
future. Begin with this question: “Regardless of how I feel about what’s
happening right now, how can I grow and learn from this experience?” How
many times has something that felt terrible to you in the moment turned
out to be trivial several months later or actually led you to an
important opportunity or in a positive new direction?</p>
<p>My last boss fired me. It felt awful at the time, but it also pushed
me way out of my comfort zone, which is where it turned out I needed to
go.</p>
<p>Looking back, the story I tell myself is that for all his
deficiencies, I learned a lot from that boss, and it all serves me well
today. I can understand, from his point of view, why he found me
difficult as an employee, without feeling devalued. Most important,
getting fired prompted me to make a decision—founding the company I now
run—that has brought me more happiness than any other work I’ve ever
done.</p>
