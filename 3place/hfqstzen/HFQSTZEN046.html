<h4 id="how-facebook-uses-empathy-to-keep-user-data-safe">8 How Facebook
Uses Empathy to Keep User Data Safe</h4>
<p>By Melissa Luu-Van</p>
<p>Online security often focuses on technical details: software,
hardware, vulnerabilities, and the like. But effective security is
driven as much by people as it is by technology. After all, the point is
to protect the consumers, employees, and partners who use our
products.</p>
<p>The ways those people interact with technology and each other can
completely change the effectiveness of your security strategy. So
security products and tools must take into account the human context of
the problems they’re solving—and that requires empathy.</p>
<p>At Facebook, empathy helps us create solutions that work because
they’re designed around our users’ experiences and well-being.
Specifically, we see three ways to make security efforts more
empathetic.</p>
<p>Consumer-driven goals that are actionable and specific. By
researching the cultural and physical contexts in which people use the
things you produce, you can define better, more precise goals for those
products. Engaging with your users on a regular basis—through reporting
tools built into your product, online surveys, or focus groups, for
example—is a necessary step for understanding, rather than assuming you
know, their challenges and needs.</p>
<p>For example, we recently asked several focus groups about their most
important security concerns on Facebook. What are they worried about?
What would help them feel safe? Overwhelmingly, people told us they
wanted more control. Simply knowing that Facebook was working behind the
scenes to protect their accounts wasn’t enough. We learned that many
Facebook users were unaware of all the security features we offer to add
extra protection to their accounts. But once they learned about them,
they were eager to use them. People also wanted to be able to control
these features and to see how each tool protects their account. These
findings told us two very important things about the security features.
First, they needed to be easier to find. Second, they needed to be more
visible and give people more control.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we created Security Checkup, a tool designed to
make Facebook’s security controls more visible and easier to use. During
early testing and after our global launch, we asked people on Facebook
about their experience using the new tool. They told us they found
Security Checkup useful and helpful; the tool’s completion rate quickly
soared to over 90%. These results are validating—but not surprising,
since we tailored Security Checkup to what we had learned about people’s
preferences and concerns.</p>
<p>Our primary goal has always been to protect the people who use
Facebook, but through our research we’ve added the goal of helping
people better protect themselves wherever they are on the web. The
security lessons our users learn on Facebook could help them develop
safer online habits—such as using unique passwords or checking app
permissions—that can be used on other sites, too.</p>
<p>Collaborative, cross-functional teams. Security is often approached
as an engineering-led effort in which cross-functional teams from
research, design, or product are less important. However, we’ve found
that disciplines besides engineering are just as critical to the thought
process and product development, because diversity of thought is an
important characteristic of empathy.</p>
<p>Cross-functional teams are particularly valuable for thinking through
the various experiences people may have with a product. Car
manufacturers have done this for years, adding seat belts and air bags
to keep people safe even when a vehicle performs outside its intended
purpose (that is, during a high-speed crash). The cars’ designs were
changed to make people’s experiences safer by default. Similarly,
Facebook’s security tools are built with the belief that better product
design leads to safer behavior. Many of our departments collaborate for
this purpose, including research, security, user experience, marketing,
product design, and communications.</p>
<p>Throughout various stages of the process, these teams convene to
discuss potential engineering, design, or security challenges; identify
solutions; and consider the impact any of these things might have on
someone’s overall experience using our products. We believe this
collective expertise helps us avoid possible issues by addressing them
early on in the development process. For example, during early
iterations of Security Checkup we realized that simply drawing attention
to our existing security features was interpreted by some people as a
warning or alert that something was wrong. Because we had design and
communication experts already working on the development team, we were
able to create a security tool with a utilitarian tone to avoid making
people feel unnecessarily concerned.</p>
<p>A focus on outcomes rather than inputs. Finally, and most important,
empathy helps us keep people safe. If people don’t have a safe
experience, it doesn’t matter how many security tools we make. That’s
why people’s actual outcomes are always our highest priority. Empathy
helps in a couple of ways.</p>
<p>First, having empathy for the people who use your products keeps you
focused on helping them make small but useful tweaks (rather than major
overhauls) to their online behavior. Because online security can be a
daunting topic, many people shy away from being proactive about it. So
encouraging people to start with small steps can go a long way. We’ve
seen that even incremental progress helps people learn how to recognize
risk and make safer choices. Simple behaviors like turning on extra
security settings for online accounts can have a huge impact on
someone’s safety.</p>
<p>Second, using empathetic language in consumer communication makes
security less intimidating and more accessible. This means using terms
and concepts that are easily understood within local cultural and
languages, even if they differ from the terms technical experts would
use. Research shows that over time, fearful communications designed to
scare people actually have a diminishing rate of return in helping
consumers avoid online threats. On the other hand, building resiliency
can help people better under stand potential threats, recover from
mistakes, and identify the most important preventative actions.</p>
<p>If you want to increase empathy on your team, one of the best ways to
do it is to invite a diverse set of disciplines to be part of the
product development process, both through hiring and through
collaborating with other teams. Professionals with experience in
psychology, behavioral sciences, or communications can bring invaluable
perspectives for building an empathetic team. Then invest in research to
understand the experience and security concerns of the people using your
products; don’t guess or assume you know what they are.</p>
<p>Empathy is not easy. It requires a commitment to deeply understanding
the people you’re protecting—but it also leads to significantly better
security. And that’s the whole point.</p>

cross-functional team focused on helping people maintain access to their
accounts and keep them secure.</p>
