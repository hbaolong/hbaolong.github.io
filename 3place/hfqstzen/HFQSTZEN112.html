<h4 id="emotional-agility">5 Emotional Agility</h4>
<p>By Susan David and Christina Congleton</p>
<p>Sixteen thousand—that’s how many words we speak, on average, each
day. So imagine how many unspoken ones course through our minds. Most of
them are not facts but evaluations and judgments entwined with
emotions—some positive and helpful (I’ve worked hard and I can ace this
presentation; This issue is worth speaking up about; The new VP seems
approachable), others negative and less so (He’s purposely ignoring me;
I’m going to make a fool of myself; I’m a fake).</p>
<p>The prevailing wisdom says that difficult thoughts and feelings have
no place at the office: Executives, and particularly leaders, should be
either stoic or cheerful; they must project confidence and damp down any
negativity bubbling up inside them. But that goes against basic biology.
All healthy human beings have an inner stream of thoughts and feelings
that include criticism, doubt, and fear. That’s just our minds doing the
job they were designed to do: trying to anticipate and solve problems
and avoid potential pitfalls.</p>
<p>In our people-strategy consulting practice advising companies around
the world, we see leaders stumble not because they have undesirable
thoughts and feelings—that’s inevitable—but because they get hooked by
them, like fish caught on a line. This happens in one of two ways. They
buy into the thoughts, treating them like facts (It was the same in my
last job . . . I’ve been a failure my whole career), and avoid
situations that evoke them (I’m not going to take on that new
challenge). Or, usually at the behest of their supporters, they
challenge the existence of the thoughts and try to rationalize them away
(I shouldn’t have thoughts like this . . . I know I’m not a total
failure), and perhaps force themselves into similar situations, even
when those go against their core values and goals (Take on that new
assignment—you’ve got to get over this). In either case, they are paying
too much attention to their internal chatter and allowing it to sap
important cognitive resources that could be put to better use.</p>
<p>This is a common problem, often perpetuated by popular
self-management strategies. We regularly see executives with recurring
emotional challenges at work—anxiety about priorities, jealousy of
others’ success, fear of rejection, distress over perceived slights—who
have devised techniques to “fix” them: positive affirmations,
prioritized to-do lists, immersion in certain tasks. But when we ask how
long the challenges have persisted, the answer might be 10 years, 20
years, or since childhood.</p>
<p>Clearly, those techniques don’t work—in fact, ample research shows
that attempting to minimize or ignore thoughts and emotions serves only
to amplify them. In a famous study led by the late Daniel Wegner, a
Harvard professor, participants who were told to avoid thinking about
white bears had trouble doing so; later, when the ban was lifted, they
thought about white bears much more than the control group did. Anyone
who has dreamed of chocolate cake and french fries while following a
strict diet understands this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Effective leaders don’t buy into or try to suppress their inner
experiences. Instead they approach them in a mindful, values-driven, and
productive way—developing what we call emotional agility. In our
complex, fast-changing knowledge economy, this ability to manage one’s
thoughts and feelings is essential to business success. Numerous
studies, from the University of London professor Frank Bond and others,
show that emotional agility can help people alleviate stress, reduce
errors, become more innovative, and improve job performance.</p>
<p>We’ve worked with leaders in various industries to build this
critical skill, and here we offer four practices—adapted from Acceptance
and Commitment Therapy (ACT), originally developed by the University of
Nevada psychologist Steven C. Hayes—that are designed to help you do the
same: Recognize your patterns; label your thoughts and emotions; accept
them; and act on your values.</p>
<p>Fish on a line</p>
<p>Let’s start with two case studies. Cynthia is a senior corporate
lawyer with two young children. She used to feel intense guilt about
missed opportunities—both at the office, where her peers worked 80 hours
a week while she worked 50, and at home, where she was often too
distracted or tired to fully engage with her husband and children. One
nagging voice in her head told her she’d have to be a better employee or
risk career failure; another told her to be a better mother or risk
neglecting her family. Cynthia wished that at least one of the voices
would shut up. But neither would, and in response she failed to put up
her hand for exciting new prospects at the office and compulsively
checked messages on her phone during family dinners.</p>
<p>Jeffrey, a rising-star executive at a leading consumer goods company,
had a different problem. Intelligent, talented, and ambitious, he was
often angry—at bosses who disregarded his views, subordinates who didn’t
follow orders, or colleagues who didn’t pull their weight. He had lost
his temper several times at work and been warned to get it under
control. But when he tried, he felt that he was shutting off a core part
of his personality, and he became even angrier and more upset.</p>
<p>These smart, successful leaders were hooked by their negative
thoughts and emotions. Cynthia was absorbed by guilt; Jeffrey was
exploding with anger. Cynthia told the voices to go away; Jeffrey
bottled his frustration. Both were trying to avoid the discomfort they
felt. They were being controlled by their inner experience, attempting
to control it, or switching between the two.</p>
<p>Getting unhooked</p>
<p>Fortunately, both Cynthia and Jeffrey realized that they couldn’t go
on—at least not successfully and happily—without more-effective inner
strategies. We coached them to adopt the four practices:</p>
<p>Recognize your patterns</p>
<p>The first step in developing emotional agility is to notice when
you’ve been hooked by your thoughts and feelings. That’s hard to do, but
there are certain telltale signs. One is that your thinking becomes
rigid and repetitive. For example, Cynthia began to see that her
self-recriminations played like a broken record, repeating the same
messages over and over again. Another is that the story your mind is
telling seems old, like a rerun of some past experience. Jeffrey noticed
that his attitude toward certain colleagues (He’s incompetent; There’s
no way I’m letting anyone speak to me like that) was quite familiar. In
fact, he had experienced something similar in his previous job—and in
the one before that. The source of trouble was not just Jeffrey’s
environment but his own patterns of thought and feeling. You have to
realize that you’re stuck before you can initiate change.</p>
<p>Label your thoughts and emotions</p>
<p>When you’re hooked, the attention you give your thoughts and feelings
crowds your mind; there’s no room to examine them. One strategy that may
help you consider your situation more objectively is the simple act of
labeling. Just as you call a spade a spade, call a thought a thought and
an emotion an emotion. I’m not doing enough at work or at home becomes
I’m having the thought that I’m not doing enough at work or at home.
Similarly, My coworker is wrong—he makes me so angry becomes I’m having
the thought that my coworker is wrong, and I’m feeling anger. Labeling
allows you to see your thoughts and feelings for what they are:
transient sources of data that may or may not prove helpful. Humans are
psychologically able to take this helicopter view of private
experiences, and mounting scientific evidence shows that simple,
straightforward mindfulness practice like this not only improves
behavior and well-being but also promotes beneficial biological changes
in the brain and at the cellular level. As Cynthia started to slow down
and label her thoughts, the criticisms that had once pressed in on her
like a dense fog became more like clouds passing through a blue sky.</p>
<p>Accept them</p>
<p>The opposite of control is acceptance: not acting on every thought or
resigning yourself to negativity but responding to your ideas and
emotions with an open attitude, paying attention to them and letting
yourself experience them. Take 10 deep breaths, and notice what’s
happening in the moment. This can bring relief, but it won’t necessarily
make you feel good. In fact, you may realize just how upset you really
are. The important thing is to show yourself (and others) some
compassion and examine the reality of the situation. What’s going
on—both internally and externally? When Jeffrey acknowledged and made
room for his feelings of frustration and anger rather than rejecting
them, quashing them, or taking them out on others, he began to notice
their energetic quality. They were a signal that something important was
at stake and that he needed to take productive action. Instead of
yelling at people, he could make a clear request of a colleague or move
swiftly on a pressing issue. The more Jeffrey accepted his anger and
brought his curiosity to it, the more it seemed to support rather than
undermine his leadership.</p>
<p>Act on your values</p>
<p>When you unhook yourself from your difficult thoughts and emotions,
you expand your choices. You can decide to act in a way that aligns with
your values. We encourage leaders to focus on the concept of
workability: Is your response going to serve you and your organization
in the long term as well as the short term? Will it help you steer
others in a direction that furthers your collective purpose? Are you
taking a step toward being the leader you most want to be and living the
life you most want to live? The mind’s thought stream flows endlessly,
and emotions change like the weather, but values can be called on at any
time, in any situation.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOUR VALUES?</p>
<p>This list is drawn from the Personal Values Card Sort (2001),
developed by W. R. Miller, J. C’de Baca, D. B. Matthews, and P. L.
Wilbourne, of the University of New Mexico. You can use it to quickly
identify the values you hold that might inform a challenging situation
at work. When you next make a decision, ask yourself whether it is
consistent with these values.</p>

<p>When Cynthia considered her values, she recognized how deeply
committed she was to both her family and her work. She loved being with
her children, but she also cared passionately about the pursuit of
justice. Unhooked from her distracting and discouraging feelings of
guilt, she resolved to be guided by her principles. She recognized how
important it was to get home for dinner with her family every evening
and to resist work interruptions during that time. But she also
undertook to make a number of important business trips, some of which
coincided with school events that she would have preferred to attend.
Confident that her values—not solely her emotions—were guiding her,
Cynthia finally found peace and fulfillment.</p>
<hr />
<p>It’s impossible to block out difficult thoughts and emotions.
Effective leaders are mindful of their inner experiences but not caught
in them. They know how to free up their internal resources and commit to
actions that align with their values. Developing emotional agility is no
quick fix. Even those who, like Cynthia and Jeffrey, regularly practice
the steps we’ve outlined here will often find themselves hooked. But
over time, leaders who become increasingly adept at it are the ones most
likely to thrive.</p>
