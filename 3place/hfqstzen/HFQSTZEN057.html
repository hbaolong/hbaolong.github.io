<h4 id="deconstructing-executive-presence">1 Deconstructing Executive
Presence</h4>
<p>By John Beeson</p>
<p>If you ask a group of managers who aspire to the C-suite what it
takes to get there, they’ll invariably mention executive presence, but
they aren’t always so clear about what it means. Not too long ago, I
conducted a series of off-the-record interviews with senior executives
responsible for executive placement in their organizations. I asked them
about the “make or break” factors they consider in making C-suite
promotion decisions. Executive presence was one of the handful of
decision criteria they cited, but even these experienced executives
struggled to define what it is and why one person has it and another
doesn’t. In an increasingly diverse world where senior executives are no
longer all six-feet-two-inch males who look like they were sent from
central casting, what does it take to create a commanding executive
presence? The right clothes? A firm handshake? Those matter, but they
don’t tell the whole story.</p>
<p>Although executive presence is highly intuitive and difficult to pin
down, it ultimately boils down to your ability to project mature
self-confidence, a sense that you can take control of difficult,
unpredictable situations; make tough decisions in a timely way and hold
your own with other talented and strong-willed members of the executive
team. If that’s the nub of the issue, what style, what behaviors combine
to signal that level of self-confidence to others? For some answers,
consider three talented managers—two of whom didn’t make it to the
executive level and one who did.</p>
<p>Every manager would love to have a Frank Simmons on his or her
management team. Experienced, results oriented, collaborative, and
committed to the company, Frank showed up on succession lists for a
number of years, but was never promoted. Although a top performer in his
area, Frank always looked a little rumpled and his posture was a bit
hunched. When he made presentations to the executive team, he was
invariably well prepared, but his lack of comfort was evident in his
body language. Normally highly articulate, his presentations were
long-winded and rambling. In the QandandandandA portion of his
presentations, he tended to be overly deferential to members of the
executive team, and he was hesitant to insert himself into the
conversation when the executives got into a debate. As one senior
executive said privately, “Frank’s an incredible asset to the company,
but I just can’t envision putting him in front of a customer.”</p>
<p>Alicia Wallace was a highly trained marketing manager who had
succeeded in every assignment she’d had. However, when it came time to
select high-potential people for promotion to more senior levels, she
always missed the cut. As much as the senior marketing executives liked
and respected her, they were never quite comfortable moving her to the
next level. The reason: her apparent disorganization. People would talk
about “Alicia being Alicia” when she arrived late to yet another
meeting, rushed, harried, and with her files askew. Was this trivial and
petty? Perhaps, but on a visceral level, it caused senior people to
question her ability to manage a larger staff and maintain the necessary
focus on implementing key priorities.</p>
<p>If you entered a room filled with 20 managers, Lydia Taylor, a member
of the legal department, wouldn’t stand out, but that would change once
the dialogue started. Although soft spoken and not terribly aggressive,
she was highly respected by her peers as well as the executives with
whom she worked. Lydia possessed outstanding listening skills and had an
unerring sense of when to enter the conversation to make her point.
Unrushed, straightforward, and unflappable, she maintained her calm,
even demeanor when others got emotional, and she used her dry sense of
humor to defuse difficult situations. When challenged by others, she
stood her ground in a firm, nonconfrontational way. Although highly
supportive of her internal customers, she was prepared to put her foot
down if anyone advocated a position that might put the company at risk.
As a result, Lydia was identified as a top candidate and groomed to
succeed the company’s general counsel.</p>
<p>The age-old question is whether executive presence can be developed?
The answer is yes, if you have a baseline of self-confidence and a
willingness to deal with the unpredictable situations that go with the
territory at the executive level. Start by addressing the basics. Find a
couple of trusted people who will give you unvarnished feedback about
your dress and grooming and the level of self-confidence you project. As
noted, dress and grooming aren’t the whole deal, but major problems can
create an impediment. One highly talented female manager was privately
described by her peers as dressing like a “school marm,” while others
said a hard-charging manager came off like a “used car salesman.” The
connotations aren’t flattering, nor are they insignificant. People tend
not to trust a used car salesman, and school marms aren’t typically
thought of as creative and risk taking, two qualities central to leading
innovation and change at the executive level.</p>
<p>Look for opportunities to hone your presentation skills. Not only is
public speaking an important executive requirement, but your ability to
“stand and deliver” to an executive group or large audience is
frequently viewed as an indicator of your ability to handle pressure.
Rehearse a major presentation until you can come off as relaxed and in
command, and pay special attention to the QandandandandA portion since
your poise when questioned and ability to think on your feet help you
project a sense of self-confidence.</p>
<p>Most important, find your voice as an executive: that is, identify
your assets and leverage them to the hilt. Some people are naturally
gregarious and can fill a room with their personality. Others, like
Lydia Taylor, rely on their listening ability, sense of timing, and
ability to maintain their composure when others get emotional. In an
increasingly diverse world, executive presence will look very different
from one executive to another. However, the constant is building the
confidence of others that you can step up as a leader when times get
tough.</p>
