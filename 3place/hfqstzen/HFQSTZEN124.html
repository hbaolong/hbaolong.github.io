<h4 id="how-to-use-your-superpower-for-good">6 How to Use Your
Superpower for Good</h4>
<p>By Peter Bregman</p>
<p>I folded my bike and carried it into the lobby of the office building
in midtown Manhattan. The security guard behind the desk looked up at
me, grimaced, then looked down again, and growled something
indecipherable.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” I asked.</p>
<p>He sighed loudly and didn’t say anything for a moment. Then, without
bothering to look at me, he said, “You’re not coming in here with
that.”</p>
<p>I was already jittery because of a near miss with a taxi on the ride
over, and this deflated me even more. It wasn’t his message—I’ve faced
many security guards who don’t like to permit bicycles into their
buildings—it was his cold, disdainful tone.</p>
<p>I tried to stay calm and upbeat. I showed him how small it was when
folded. I told him I had a bag I could put it in. He repeated the same
line.</p>
<p>Finally, after citing the Bicycle Access to Office Buildings Law,
which requires New York City buildings with freight elevators to admit
bicycles, he let me in.</p>
<p>When I made it to the freight elevator, I smiled at the operator who
was joking with some construction workers. He looked at me, then looked
back at his friends and kept talking. I waited uncomfortably for several
minutes and then asked him if he would take me to the 19th floor. He
said something rude to his friends about tenants, took me up in silence,
and left me in a small vestibule with a locked door but no clear way to
enter.</p>
<p>He shut his door as I was asking him how to get in. “Try pushing the
button,” he barked through the closed elevator door. I saw the button he
meant and pushed. At this point I was feeling lower than low.</p>
<p>Then, like magic, my morning changed.</p>
<p>“Hi! You must be Peter. Welcome!” Lisa (names have been changed), the
receptionist, sang as she opened the door. She smiled, and then looked
worried. “Why did you come up in the freight?”</p>
<p>I explained my morning and she frowned empathetically. “I’m so sorry.
That’s terrible. Here, let me take your bike.”</p>
<p>I could have cried from happiness. In one second, Lisa turned my
emotions around, from the negative spiral of anger, frustration, and
despair to the positive spiral of relief, appreciation, and
happiness.</p>
<p>And that’s when I realized: We all have superpowers.</p>
<p>We can make people feel good or bad by as simple a thing as a
gesture, an expression, a word, or a tone of voice.</p>
<p>But wait. Can I really blame my grumpiness on you? Isn’t each person
responsible for his or her own mood?</p>
<p>Here’s what we know: Like the common cold, emotions are contagious.
Caroline Bartel at New York University and Richard Saavedra at the
University of Michigan studied 70 work groups across a variety of
industries and found that people who worked together ended up sharing
moods, good and bad.1 Moods converge.</p>
<p>This is particularly important to understand for people in positions
of authority because leaders, more than anyone, set and spread the mood.
If you’ve ever worked in an office, you know this from experience. If
the boss is in a bad mood, conflicts increase. If she’s in a good mood,
people lighten up.</p>
<p>Does that mean we aren’t responsible if we snap at someone in the
hallway? That it’s really the fault of the guy who bumped into us on the
subway and didn’t apologize?</p>
<p>Look at it this way: If you catch a cold from someone, does that mean
you can go around sneezing on everyone else? You might be able to blame
your mood on someone else, but you’re still responsible for what you
pass to others.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it’s hard to completely avoid infecting others when you
have a cold. Several years ago I was asked to coach Renée, a senior
manager in a retail company, who was receiving feedback that she was too
harsh with her employees. She often raised her voice, criticized them
mercilessly for mistakes, and humiliated them for not knowing
things.</p>
<p>When I spoke to others in the office, I found out that the CEO to
whom Renée reported treated his direct reports the same way. He was
short-tempered, yelled a lot, and demanded perfection from others.</p>
<p>That didn’t make it okay for Renée to treat her direct reports that
way; it just made it harder for her not to.</p>
<p>Which is a problem for the business because mood affects performance.
According to research done by Sigal Barsade at Yale University, positive
moods improved cooperation, decreased conflict, and increased
performance.</p>
<p>So what’s the solution?</p>
<p>Know your emotions, be in touch with your moods, and think of them
like the common cold. If you feel infected by bad cheer, take a deep
breath, recognize how you’re feeling, and choose not to pass it on.</p>
<p>Instead, treat people with the empathy, care, and good humor that
will make them feel happier, more connected, and more productive.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: Barsade’s research found that positive moods
are just as contagious as negative moods.</p>
<p>Is it really a choice though? If you’re in a bad mood, can you decide
to be happy? I find it hard, inauthentic, even dishonest, to feign
happiness.</p>
<p>But I have found a pretty simple solution to turning it all around:
kindness.</p>
<p>No matter how bad a mood I’m in, I’ve found it pretty straightforward
to treat others with kindness. And that, invariably, has a positive
effect on those around me, which, as we’ve seen, has a positive effect
on me. And, voilà, my mood changes for the better.</p>
<p>When Lisa brought me to my client’s office, I told him how my ugly
morning had been turned around by his delightful receptionist. He
responded with a story of his own. Once, when Lisa was sick and couldn’t
come to work, a quiet and reserved man named Frank acted as receptionist
for the day. Frank was not the sing-song type.</p>
<p>But Frank was used to Lisa’s good cheer. Each morning, like everyone
else in the office, he received her buoyant emails welcoming people to
the office. And, on this particular day, when he was asked to fill in
for Lisa, the mere memory of her lighthearted emotions was enough to
influence him.</p>
<p>First thing that morning, on his own initiative, Frank wrote an email
to the whole office that read: “It’s pizzaaaaaaa for lunch! I hope
everybody has a happy day!!!!!!”</p>
