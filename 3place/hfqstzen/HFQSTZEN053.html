<h4 id="how-to-deal-with-a-passive-aggressive-colleague">5 How to Deal
with a Passive-Aggressive Colleague</h4>
<p>By Amy Gallo</p>
<p>Your colleague says one thing in a meeting but then does another. He
passes you in the hallway without saying hello and talks over you in
meetings. But when you ask to speak with him about his behavior, he
insists that everything’s fine and the problem is all in your head. But
it’s not: He’s being passive-aggressive. Working with someone like this
can be so frustrating. Do you address the behavior directly? Or try to
ignore it? How can you get to the core issue when your colleague
pretends that nothing’s going on?</p>
<p>What the experts say</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for colleagues to occasionally make
passive-aggressive remarks to one another over particularly sensitive
issues or when they feel they can’t be direct. “We’re all guilty of
doing it once in a while,” says Amy Su, coauthor of Own the Room:
Discover Your Signature Voice to Master Your Leadership Presence. But
persistent passive-aggressive behavior is a different ballgame. “These
are people who will often do anything to get what they need, including
lie,” says Annie McKee, founder of the Teleos Leadership Institute and
coauthor of Primal Leadership: Unleashing the Power of Emotional
Intelligence. In these cases, you have to take special precautions that
help you, and hopefully your counterpart, both get your jobs done. Here
are some tips.</p>
<p>Don’t get caught up</p>
<p>When your coworker pretends nothing is going on or accuses you of
overreacting, it’s hard not to get angry and defensive. But “this is not
one of those situations to fight fire with fire,” McKee says. Do your
best to remain calm. “The person may want you to get mad so they can
then blame you, which is a release of their own anxiety,” Su explains.
“Responding in an emotional way will likely leave you looking—and
feeling—like the fool. This is your opportunity to be the bigger
person.”</p>
<p>Consider what’s motivating the behavior</p>
<p>People who routinely act in a passive-aggressive way aren’t
necessarily complete jerks. It could be that they don’t know how to
communicate or are afraid of conflict. McKee says that
passive-aggressive behavior is often a way for people to “get their
emotional point across without having true, healthy conflict.” There’s
also a self-centeredness to it. “They make the flawed assumption that
others should know what they’re feeling and that their needs and
preferences are more important than [those of] others’,” says Su.
Understand this, but don’t try to diagnose all your colleague’s
problems. “You just have to see it for what it is,” Su adds: “an
unproductive expression of emotions that they can’t share
constructively.”</p>
<p>Own your part</p>
<p>Chances are that you’re not blameless in the situation. Ask yourself
if something you’re doing is contributing to the dynamic or causing the
person to be passive-aggressive. “Own your half,” says Su. Also,
consider whether you’ve dished out the same behavior; know the signs.1
“It can happen to even the best of us, whether we’re procrastinating or
wanting to avoid something. We might leak emotions in a way that’s
hurtful to others,” says Su.</p>
<p>Focus on the content, not the delivery</p>
<p>It might be the last thing you want to do, but try to see the
situation from your colleague’s perspective. What is the underlying
opinion or perspective she’s attempting to convey with her snarky
comment? “Analyze the position the person is trying to share with you,”
says McKee. Does she think that the way you’re running the project isn’t
working? Or does she disagree about your team goals? “Not everyone knows
how to publicly discuss or express what they think,” says Su. If you can
focus on the underlying business concern or question rather than the way
she’s expressing herself, you can move on to addressing the actual
problem.</p>
<p>Acknowledge the underlying issue</p>
<p>Once you’re calm and able to engage in a productive conversation, go
back to the person. Say something like, “You made a good point in that
exchange we had the other day. Here’s what I heard you saying.” This
will help them talk about the substance of their concerns.” By joining
with them, you’ll have a better chance of turning the energy around,”
McKee explains. Do this in a matter-of-fact way, without discussing how
the sentiment was expressed. “Don’t listen or give any credence to the
toxic part,” advises Su. “Sometimes it’s that they just want their
opinion heard.”</p>
<p>Watch your language</p>
<p>Whatever you say, don’t accuse the person of being
passive-aggressive. “That can hurt your cause,” says McKee. Su agrees:
“It’s such a loaded word. It would put someone who’s already on the
defensive into a more angry position. Don’t label or judge them.”
Instead, McKee suggests recounting how some of your previous
interactions have played out and explaining the impact it’s having on
you and possibly others. If feasible, show that the behavior is working
against something your counterpart cares about, like achieving the
team’s goals.</p>
<p>Find safety in numbers</p>
<p>You don’t have to deal with this situation alone. “It’s OK to reality
check with others and have allies in place to say you’re not crazy,”
says Su. But be sure to frame your discussions as an attempt to
constructively improve the relationship, so it doesn’t come across as
gossiping or bad-mouthing your colleague. Su suggests you ask for honest
opinions, something like “I was wondering how Emily’s comment landed
with you. How did you interpret that?”</p>
<p>Set guidelines for everyone</p>
<p>You might also enlist the help of others in coming up with a
long-term solution. “As a team, you can build healthy norms,” McKee
says. Together you can agree to be more up-front about frustrations and
model the honest and direct interactions you want to happen. You can
also keep one another accountable. If your problematic colleague tends
to ignore agreements, you might take notes in meetings about who’s
supposed to do what by when, so there are clear action items. The worst
offenders are likely to give in to the positive peer pressure and public
accountability.</p>
<p>Get help in extreme situations</p>
<p>When a colleague persistently tries to undermine you or prevent you
from doing your job and outside observers confirm your take on the
situation, you might have to go further. “If you share the same manager,
you may be able to ask for help,” says McKee. You might tell your boss,
“A lot of us have noticed a particular behavior, and I want to talk
about how it’s impacting my ability to do my work.” But “step into those
waters carefully,” she warns. “Your manager may be hoodwinked by the
person and may not see the same behaviors or be conflict averse himself
and not want to see it.”</p>
<p>Protect yourself</p>
<p>“If there’s an interdependence in your work, make sure you’re meeting
your commitments and deadlines,” Su says. “Copy others on important
emails. Don’t let that person speak for you or represent you in
meetings. After a meeting, document agreements and next steps.” McKee
also suggests keeping records. “Track specific behaviors so that you
have examples if needed,” she says. “It’s hard to argue with the facts.”
She also recommends you try to avoid working with the person and “keep
contact to a minimum. If you have to work together, do it in a group
setting” where your colleague is likely to be on better behavior. You
might not be able to break the person of his passive-aggressive habits,
but you can control your reaction to it.</p>
<p>Principles to remember</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Understand why people typically act this way: Their needs probably
aren’t being met.</p>
<p>Focus on the message your colleague is trying to convey, even if
their delivery is misguided.</p>
<p>Take a step back and ask yourself if you’re contributing to the issue
in some way.</p>
<p>Don’t:</p>
<p>Lose your cool. Address the underlying business issue in a calm,
matter-of-fact way.</p>
<p>Accuse the person of acting passive-aggressively—that will only make
them madder.</p>
<p>Assume you can change your colleague’s behavior.</p>
<p>Case study #1: Make your coworker publicly accountable</p>
<p>One of Mitch Davis’s coworkers in the student guidance office of the
public high school where he worked was making things difficult for him
(names and details in both these case studies have been changed). “She
would agree to a plan in a meeting but then sabotage it by not following
through,” he explains. His colleague, Sarah, defended herself by saying
things like “That’s not how I remember it” or “I didn’t think we had
finalized the plan.” He tried to talk about these “misunderstandings”
with her, but she always shrugged him off. “She’d say she was busy or
didn’t have time to talk,” he explained.</p>
<p>When Mitch told Jim, his and Sarah’s boss, that a certain project
hadn’t gotten done because of this strange dynamic, Jim said that he had
noticed the pattern too. Together, they devised a plan to make Sarah
more accountable. “He and I agreed that he would publicly ask for a
volunteer to take notes on each meeting, [documenting] who would be
responsible for accomplishing each task and by when,” Mitch recalls. He
was the first volunteer.</p>
<p>And the approach worked. After Mitch sent around the task list, Sarah
couldn’t make excuses. She was accountable to everyone who attended the
meetings. And Mitch didn’t mind the additional work: “The extra effort I
put in was less than the time I was spending fuming about my coworker
and running around to pick up the pieces of the things she didn’t
complete. It actually helped everyone in our department be more
productive and was something we should have done a long time ago.”</p>
<p>Case study #2: Get help sooner rather than later</p>
<p>Emily Sullivan, a digital marketing consultant at a small agency, had
recently been promoted and managed an eight-person team. One of her
direct reports, Will, had only been at the agency for three months
before Emily’s promotion, and he clearly wasn’t thrilled to suddenly
have her as a new boss. But “he was a top performer and extremely
competent,” Emily recalls, and since they’d worked “fairly harmoniously
together as colleagues,” she was happy to have him in the group.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Will became very difficult to manage. He didn’t
communicate with Emily unless absolutely necessary, he didn’t actively
engage in training sessions that she offered, and he “poked holes” in
her initiatives. “He took every opportunity to make it clear that he
didn’t value my input,” she explains.</p>
<p>Surprised and dismayed by his attitude, Emily decided to address it
as she would with any other team member: directly and clearly. She
started by asking him in their one-on-one meetings whether something was
wrong. He said there wasn’t, but the behavior persisted, so she tried
taking him out for coffee and asking whether she had unknowingly
offended him or if he wanted to be managed in a different way. He
acknowledged that there was a “personality clash,” but he ended the
conversation there and continued to treat her dismissively at the
office. She heard from other staff members that he had even called her
“lazy and useless.”</p>
<p>“The last thing I wanted was to pass the issue further up the chain
and potentially harm Will’s career,” she says. After all, he was a
valuable team member, and she wanted to protect him. But she came to see
that she should have gone to her manager from the start. When she
eventually did, her boss pointed out that her failure to effectively
manage a key team member amounted to poor performance on her part.</p>
<p>Within a year both Emily and Will voluntarily left the agency, but
neither was happy with the circumstances. She says that if she could do
it over again she would’ve talked to her manager sooner, kept better
records on Will’s “toxic attitude,” and, when there weren’t drastic
improvements, fired him “without hesitation.”</p>
