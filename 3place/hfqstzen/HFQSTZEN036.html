Code That Stalls People of Color</h4>
<p>By Sylvia Ann Hewlett</p>
<p>It’s a topic that corporations once routinely ignored, then
dismissed, and are only now beginning to discuss: the dearth of
professionals of color in senior positions. Professionals of color hold
only 11% of executive posts in corporate America.1 Among Fortune 500
CEOs, only six are black, eight are Asian, and eight are Hispanic.2</p>
<p>Performance and hard work, along with sponsors, get top talent
recognized and promoted, but leadership potential isn’t enough to lever
men and women into the executive suite. Top jobs are given to those who
also look and act the part, who manifest “executive presence” (EP).
According to research by the Center for Talent Innovation (CTI), EP
constitutes 26% of what senior leaders say it takes to get the next
promotion.3 Yet because senior leaders are overwhelmingly Caucasian,
professionals of color (African American, Asian, and Hispanic
individuals) find themselves at an immediate disadvantage in trying to
look, sound, and act like a leader. And the feedback that might help
them do so is markedly absent at all levels of management.</p>
<p>Executive presence rests on three pillars: gravitas (the core
characteristic, according to 67% of the 268 senior executives surveyed),
an amalgam of behaviors that convey confidence, inspire trust, and
bolster credibility; communication skills (according to 28%); and
appearance, the filter through which communication skills and gravitas
become more apparent. While they are aware of the importance of EP, men
and women of color are nonetheless hard-pressed to interpret and embody
aspects of a code written by and for white men.</p>
<p>Research from CTI finds that professionals of color, like their
Caucasian counterparts, prioritize gravitas over communication and
communication over appearance. Yet, “cracking the code” of executive
presence presents unique challenges for professionals of color because
standards of appropriate behavior, speech, and attire demand they
suppress or sacrifice aspects of their cultural identity in order to
conform. They overwhelmingly feel that EP at their firm is based on
white male standards—African Americans, especially, were 97% more likely
than their Caucasian counterparts to agree with this assessment—and that
conforming to these standards requires altering their authenticity, a
new version of “bleached-out professionalism” that contributes to
feelings of resentment and disengagement. (See figures 2 and 3.) People
of color already feel they have to work harder than their Caucasian
counterparts just to be perceived as being on a par with them; more than
half (56%) of minority professionals also feel they are held to a
stricter code of EP standards.</p>

presence standards at my company</p>

<p>Executive presence further eludes professionals of color because
they’re not likely to get feedback on their “presentation of self.”
Qualitative findings affirm that their superiors, most of whom are
white, hesitate to call attention to gravitas shortfalls or
communication blunders for fear of coming across as racially insensitive
or discriminatory. While sponsors might close this gap by specifically
addressing EP issues with their high potentials, CTI’s 2012 research
shows that professionals of color are much less likely to have a sponsor
than Caucasians (8% versus 13%).4 When they do get feedback, they’re
unclear about how to act on it, particularly if they were born outside
the United States. (See figure 4.) This is a serious problem for
corporations that need local expertise to expand their influence in
global markets.</p>

<p>In short, because feedback is either absent, overly vague, or
contradictory, executive presence remains an inscrutable set of rules
for professionals of color—rules they’re judged by but cannot interpret
and embody except at considerable cost to their authenticity.
Consequently, in a workplace where unconscious bias continues to
permeate the corridors of power and leadership is mostly white and male,
professionals of color are measurably disadvantaged in their efforts to
be perceived as leaders.</p>
<p>As America becomes more diverse at home and its companies are
increasingly engaged in the global marketplace, winning in today’s
fiercely competitive economy requires a diverse workforce that “matches
the market.” Such individuals are better attuned to the unmet needs of
consumers or clients like themselves. Research from CTI shows, however,
that their insights need a key ingredient to reach full-scale
implementation: a cadre of equally diverse leaders.5 Yet the power of
difference is missing at the top, just when it matters most.</p>
