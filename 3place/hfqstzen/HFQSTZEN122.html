<h4 id="four-ways-leaders-fritter-their-power-away">4 Four Ways Leaders
Fritter Their Power Away</h4>
<p>By Ron Carucci</p>
<p>“The last thing I want is to be perceived as a power-monger.” That
was what one high-ranking executive recently told me, and the sentiment
among top leaders is common. The executive who embezzles money, curries
favor with bribes, or gets caught in sordid affairs makes headlines and
is justly derided. But our 10-year longitudinal study revealed that the
paralyzed executive is just as dangerous and likely more common.</p>
<p>We conducted more than 2,700 interviews with more than 100 newly
transitioned executives, and while the data warned against the allure of
using power for self-interest, we saw the greater challenge of power
wasn’t exploiting it, but abdicating it.</p>
<p>In an effort to create egalitarianism, to make direct reports feel
valued and included, and to avoid risks associated with making tough
calls, these leaders struggled to exercise power. Of those interviewed,
57% found decisions more complicated and risky than they expected, while
61% said people wanted more of their time than they could give, yet felt
guilty saying no because they didn’t want to appear inaccessible. Frozen
in a need to please or be liked, or in fearful avoidance of catastrophic
error, these leaders effectively felt powerless: An astounding 60% of
our participants struggled with the fact that people ascribed more power
to them than they actually believed they had. Nearly half our
respondents indicated believing the power accompanying their jobs was
insufficient to execute the objectives with which they were charged.</p>
<p>At some point, probably every executive has lamented, “How is it I
have all these resources, and I still can’t make anything happen?” We
frequently hear this from new executives. And yet such leaders are often
guilty of abdicating the power that they do have. Of the many
abdications of power we isolated, we identified four particularly
recurring and destructive ones:</p>
<p>Paralysis. This is one of the most widespread forms of abdication,
and can have crippling effects on an organization. One executive bore
the nickname “the waffle” because of his inability to stick to a
decision. He was frequently susceptible to the “last one in”
phenomenon—the last person in his office swayed him toward their views.
Regardless of the data or support he amassed, he never declared a final
choice, leaving behind confusion about whether a decision had been made.
The team quickly learned this lack of clarity worked to their advantage.
Absent any evidence a decision had been finalized, they could interpret
meeting outcomes consistent with their views. The risk was minimal
because they could always claim it was what they understood “his”
decision to be.</p>
<p>Over-inclusion. Including too many people also inhibits leaders’
decisiveness. Fearful leaders delude themselves in thinking that the way
to disperse risk is by getting lots of people involved. While including
those who must live with a decision’s consequences is important,
over-including people at the expense of action isn’t consensus building;
it’s hiding. Many respondents pointed with exasperation to this
challenge among executive ranks. One complained, “The number of people
who expect to have a say in decisions is ridiculous. I spend more time
building false consensus than increasing the quality of the decision. I
thought I would have more authority than I do.” Newly appointed
executives must have thick skin to withstand the inevitable hostility
that comes with unpopular decisions. Avoiding it doesn’t disperse risk.
It heightens it.</p>
<p>Accommodation. Pandering to the agendas of others at the expense of a
greater good also abdicates power. Yes, people feel deep ownership when
they have greater control over the direction of their projects, but that
kind of empowerment should never come at the expense of a broader
organizational agenda. Senior leaders can shape that strategic direction
while still leaving plenty of room for others to make choices that
translate the vision into action. Doling out yeses to resource requests
for individuals’ agendas “so they feel ownership” is not empowerment;
it’s abandonment. Narrowing priorities and focus to strengthen execution
is one of an executive’s greatest unifying contributions. When the need
to say yes overpowers the courage to say no, it fragments organizations
and results in the final form of abdication.</p>
<p>Tolerating poor performance. This is the final major pattern we
noticed, and unfortunately, in organizations where people are confused
by too many competing priorities and grappling with poorly allocated
resources, there’s a lot of poor performance to observe. Once people
conclude the plan can’t be taken seriously because the priorities change
by the day, their commitment to drive the strategy is diluted, and
results falter. To avoid exposing their own hypocrisy, executives who
set the mayhem in motion can’t call the question on the performance free
fall, so must tolerate it. Paradoxically, doling out too many yeses
serves to exterminate the very ownership executives sought to strengthen
and leads the splintered organization into the performance pitfall these
leaders so desperately believed they were avoiding.</p>
<hr />
<p>Power is an essential asset of executive roles. It is the currency
that ensures a leader’s legacy. It can right organizational injustices,
nurture promising talent, and drive great achievements. It requires
careful stewardship, yes, but the way to make good things happen is by
embracing your influence, not fearing it.</p>
