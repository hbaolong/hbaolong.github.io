<h4 id="youre-never-done-finding-purpose-at-work">5 You’re Never Done
Finding Purpose at Work</h4>
<p>By Dan Pontefract</p>
<p>Do you dread going into the office on Monday morning? Maybe a new
boss has entered the equation, creating a rift between how you once felt
and how you feel now. Perhaps your company has recently been acquired,
and the culture has changed. Maybe you simply have outgrown your role
and are bored to tears in your cubicle.</p>
<p>I have found that whether or not we enjoy our work often boils down
to how our job fits with our sense of purpose. Where we work, the role
we hold, our broader sense of purpose—all three are subject to change.
Thus, if we want to stay in the “sweet spot” among these three, we must
not fear career transitions or even change itself; indeed, we must seek
them out.</p>
<p>Having a sense of purpose in our life is critical to well-being. In
fact, in a longitudinal study, researchers found that people who
demonstrate a sense of purpose in their lives have a 15% lower risk of
early death.1 Having a sense of purpose in our roles at work is equally
important. And yet it’s not enough to find that sense of purpose
once—you have to continually find it as circumstances (and you)
change.</p>
<p>“I am cautious and alert and mindful that the battle is not won yet”
is how Céline Schillinger, an executive at vaccine maker Sanofi Pasteur,
describes staying on this learning journey. “I will not fall into
complacency. No matter what, I will continue to hone myself.” In 2001
Schillinger landed a position in France at the company. To date, she has
occupied positions in human resources, product development, and
stakeholder engagement. She moved to Boston in 2015 to focus on quality
innovation. “I would define myself as a person under construction,” she
told me. “I’m always trying to enrich my experience by adding bits and
pieces wherever I go. I experiment in my roles and push for
uncomfortableness to eventually gain new knowledge out of each
situation.”</p>
<p>Schillinger’s story shows that you don’t have to quit your company to
stay engaged. However, sometimes a more radical change is needed.
Consider the story of Mana Ionescu. She worked hard to climb the ladder
at the U.S.-based company she worked for, and she was in line for the
director role. But Ionescu was frustrated by the transactional nature of
her work. Creativity was minimal. Inspiration was nominal. “There must
be more to my working life than just sitting here making money and not
actually making an impact,” she thought. She decided to leave her
organization and founded Lightspan Digital, a digital marketing company
based in Chicago that specializes in social media, email, and content
marketing. Ionescu recognized that she had to take charge of both her
personal life and her working life—and ever since, she has been living
and working with a sense of purpose. It’s up to each of us to know when
to make that leap.</p>
<p>Try this exercise. At the end of the workday, jot down approximately
how much time you spent in each of the following three mindsets:</p>
<p>Job mindset. When someone has a job mindset, they resort to a
“paycheck mentality,” performing their duties in return for compensation
and not much else.</p>
<p>Career mindset. This mindset occurs when an individual is focused on
increasing or advancing their salary, title, power, team size, or sphere
of control.</p>
<p>Purpose mindset. Feeling passionate, innovative, and committed are
hallmarks of this mindset, as is having an outward-looking focus on
serving the broader organization or key stakeholders. Here, your
professional purpose feels aligned with your personal purpose.</p>
<p>Keep a log for a couple of weeks, and see whether you fall into one
of these mindsets more than the others. If the job and career mindsets
total more than 50% of your time, that may be a warning sign that you
need to restate or redefine your personal purpose.</p>
<p>No one lives in the purpose mindset all the time, but spending too
much time in the career or job mindsets is destructive: You are certain
to be dissatisfied with your job, and these mindsets can end up harming
your reputation, chances of promotion, and long-term prospects. While
everyone should be trying to develop and grow, focusing too much on your
career or your paycheck can lead to bad behaviors such as bullying and
selfishness or simply trying to exert too much control over others.
Before that happens, seek a new role, and perhaps a new organization,
that rebalances your equation.</p>
<p>If you have never created a personal declaration of purpose, now is
the time. A declaration of purpose is a simple statement about how you
will decide to live each and every day. Make it succinct, specific,
jargon free, and expressive. Your statement ought to be personal, and it
should integrate your strengths, interests, and core ambitions. Here’s
mine: “We’re not here to see through each other; we’re here to see each
other through.” (For more on a personal declaration of purpose, see
chapter 6 of this book.)</p>
<p>Take into account all three types of purpose: personal, job, and
organization. But don’t shortchange your personal purpose, which is a
common error, according to A. R. Elangovan, a professor of
organizational behavior at the University of Victoria in Canada. As he
told me, “Especially in contrast to organizational and role purpose,
where multiple stakeholders shape the outcomes, my advice is to invest
as much effort [as possible] into figuring out our personal
purpose.”</p>
<p>Life is short. You deserve to work in a role, and for an
organization, where your personal purpose shines. But you cannot leave
it up to the organization, your boss, or your team. It really does come
down to you defining and enacting your purpose.</p>
