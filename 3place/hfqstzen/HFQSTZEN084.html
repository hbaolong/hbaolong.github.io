<h4 id="to-seem-confident-women-have-to-be-seen-as-warm">12 To Seem
Confident, Women Have to Be Seen as Warm</h4>
<p>By Margarita Mayo</p>
<p>Why are there so few women in leadership roles? My research
collaborators (Laura Guillén of ESMT and Natalia Karelaia of INSEAD) and
I believe we have shed some new light on this conundrum. But first, some
background.</p>
<p>One frequently cited reason has to do with confidence. In a previous
study, my colleagues and I found that women tend to rate their abilities
accurately, while men tend to be overconfident about theirs.1 Thus, one
argument goes, women are less confident than men, which hurts their
chances of promotion.</p>
<p>Previous research has measured how women see themselves, but we
wanted to know how outside perceivers—bosses, subordinates,
colleagues—rate women’s confidence, and what influences those
ratings.</p>
<p>Susan Fiske and her colleagues have shown that people seem to
universally use two dimensions to judge others: competence and warmth.2
We decided to test for both of those in addition to confidence. As a
proxy for the likelihood of being promoted, we also tested for
influence, on the theory that people who are seen as influential are
more likely to be promoted to leadership roles.</p>
<p>We conducted a study analyzing the judgments that colleagues made
regarding the competence and warmth of 236 engineers working in project
teams at a multinational software development company.3 As part of their
performance evaluation, the engineers were evaluated online by their
supervisor, peers, and collaborators on competence and warmth. A total
of 810 raters provided this confidential evaluation. A year later, we
collected a second wave of data on the same 236 engineers about their
apparent confidence at work and their influence in the organization.
This time, a total of 1,236 raters provided information.</p>
<p>Our study shows that men are seen as confident if they are seen as
competent, but women are seen as confident only if they come across as
both competent and warm. Women must be seen as warm in order to
capitalize on their competence and be seen as confident and influential
at work; competent men are seen as confident and influential whether
they are warm or not.</p>
<p>In other words, for male engineers, competence and perceived
confidence go hand in hand. The more competent male engineers are, the
more confident they are seen as being (and vice versa). The more
confident they are seen as being, the more influence they have in the
organization, regardless of whether others like them. It seems that
warmth is irrelevant to men appearing confident and influential, at
least when they are performing a typically male job like
engineering.</p>
<p>For women, in the absence of warmth there was virtually no
relationship between competence and confidence ratings. When women were
seen as both warm and competent, they were also seen as more
confident—and thus more influential. Competent but less-affable female
engineers were evaluated by their colleagues as less confident in their
professional roles. These female engineers were, in turn, less
influential within the organization. In sum, women’s professional
performance is not evaluated independently from their personal
warmth.</p>
<p>Personal experience and empirical research suggest that it’s not
enough for women to be merely as gregarious, easygoing, sociable, and
helpful as men. To get credit for being warm—and to have their other
strengths recognized—they might need to be even more so.</p>
<p>I still remember my first performance evaluation as an assistant
lecturer: I was told to be more “nurturing.” I had gone to just as many
social events as the men had, had been just as gregarious with my
students. But women simply are expected to show more warmth. Studies
show, for example, that women’s performance reviews contain nearly twice
as much language about being warm, empathetic, helpful, and dedicated to
others.4</p>
<p>To us, this study suggests that if women are to succeed in a biased
world, encouraging them to be more confident is not enough. To get
credit for having confidence and competence, and to have the influence
in their organizations that they would like to have, women must go out
of their way to be seen as warm.</p>
<p>We wish this were not the case. We wish women and men could be
evaluated according to the same meritocratic standards. But as our
research shows, we seem to be a long way off from those days.</p>
