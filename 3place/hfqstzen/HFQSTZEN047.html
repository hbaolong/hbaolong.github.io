<h4 id="the-limits-of-empathy">9 The Limits of Empathy</h4>
<p>By Adam Waytz</p>
<p>A few years ago, Ford Motor Company started asking its (mostly male)
engineers to wear the Empathy Belly, a simulator that allows them to
experience symptoms of pregnancy first-hand—the back pain, the bladder
pressure, the 30 or so pounds of extra weight. They can even feel
“movements” that mimic fetal kicking. The idea is to get them to
understand the ergonomic challenges that pregnant women face when
driving, such as limited reach, shifts in posture and center of gravity,
and general bodily awkwardness.</p>
<p>It’s unclear whether this has improved Ford’s cars or increased
customer satisfaction, but the engineers claim benefits from the
experience. They’re still using the belly; they’re also simulating the
foggy vision and stiff joints of elderly drivers with an “age suit.” If
nothing more, these exercises are certainly an attempt to “get the other
person’s point of view,” which Henry Ford once famously said was the key
to success.</p>
<p>Empathy is all the rage pretty much everywhere—not just at Ford and
not just on engineering and product development teams. It’s at the heart
of design thinking and innovation more broadly defined. It’s also touted
as a critical leadership skill—one that helps you influence others in
your organization, anticipate stakeholders’ concerns, respond to social
media followers, and even run better meetings.</p>
<p>But recent research (by me and many others) suggests that all this
heat and light may be a bit too intense. Though empathy is essential to
leading and managing others—without it, you’ll make disastrous decisions
and forfeit the benefits just described—failing to recognize its limits
can impair individual and organizational performance.</p>
<p>Here are some of the biggest problems you can run into and
recommendations for getting around them.</p>
<p>Problem #1: It’s exhausting</p>
<p>Like heavy-duty cognitive tasks, such as keeping multiple pieces of
information in mind at once or avoiding distractions in a busy
environment, empathy depletes our mental resources. So jobs that require
constant empathy can lead to “compassion fatigue,” an acute inability to
empathize that’s driven by stress, and burnout, a more gradual and
chronic version of this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Health and human services professionals (doctors, nurses, social
workers, corrections officers) are especially at risk, because empathy
is central to their day-to-day jobs. In a study of hospice nurses, for
example, the key predictors for compassion fatigue were psychological:
anxiety, feelings of trauma, life demands, and what the researchers call
excessive empathy, meaning the tendency to sacrifice one’s own needs for
others’ (rather than simply “feeling” for people).1 Variables such as
long hours and heavy caseloads also had an impact, but less than
expected. And in a survey of Korean nurses, self-reported compassion
fatigue strongly predicted their intentions to leave their jobs in the
near future.2 Other studies of nurses show additional consequences of
compassion fatigue, such as absenteeism and increased errors in
administering medication.</p>
<p>People who work for charities and other nonprofits (think animal
shelters) are similarly at risk. Voluntary turnover is exceedingly high,
in part because of the empathically demanding nature of the work; low
pay exacerbates the element of self-sacrifice. What’s more, society’s
strict views of how nonprofits should operate mean they face a backlash
when they act like businesses (for instance, investing in “overhead” to
keep the organization running smoothly). They’re expected to thrive
through selfless outpourings of compassion from workers.</p>
<p>The demand for empathy is relentless in other sectors as well. Day
after day, managers must motivate knowledge workers by understanding
their experiences and perspectives and helping them find personal
meaning in their work. Customer service professionals must continually
quell the concerns of distressed callers. Empathy is exhausting in any
setting or role in which it’s a primary aspect of the job.</p>
<p>Problem #2: It’s zero-sum</p>
<p>Empathy doesn’t just drain energy and cognitive resources—it also
depletes itself. The more empathy I devote to my spouse, the less I have
left for my mother; the more I give to my mother, the less I can give my
son. Both our desire to be empathic and the effort it requires are in
limited supply, whether we’re dealing with family and friends or
customers and colleagues.</p>
<p>Consider this study: Researchers examined the trade-offs associated
with empathic behaviors at work and at home by surveying 844 workers
from various sectors, including hairstylists, firefighters, and telecom
professionals.3 People who reported workplace behaviors such as taking
“time to listen to coworkers’ problems and worries” and helping “others
who have heavy workloads” felt less capable of connecting with their
families. They felt emotionally drained and burdened by work-related
demands.</p>
<p>Sometimes the zero-sum problem leads to another type of trade-off:
Empathy toward insiders—say, people on our teams or in our
organizations—can limit our capacity to empathize with people outside
our immediate circles. We naturally put more time and effort into
understanding the needs of our close friends and colleagues. We simply
find it easier to do, because we care more about them to begin with.
This uneven investment creates a gap that’s widened by our limited
supply of empathy: As we use up most of what’s available on insiders,
our bonds with them get stronger, while our desire to connect with
outsiders wanes.</p>
<p>Preferential empathy can antagonize those who see us as protecting
our own (think about how people reacted when the Pope praised the
Catholic Church’s handling of sexual abuse). It can also, a bit more
surprisingly, lead to insiders’ aggression toward outsiders. For
example, in a study I conducted with University of Chicago professor
Nicholas Epley, we looked at how two sets of participants—those sitting
with a friend (to prime empathic connection) and those sitting with a
stranger—would treat a group of terrorists, an outgroup with
particularly negative associations. After describing the terrorists, we
asked how much participants endorsed statements portraying them as
subhuman, how acceptable waterboarding them would be, and how much
voltage of electric shock they would be willing to administer to them.
Merely sitting in a room with a friend significantly increased people’s
willingness to torture and dehumanize.</p>
<p>Although this study represents an extreme case, the same principle
holds for organizations. Compassion for one’s own employees and
colleagues sometimes produces aggressive responses toward others. More
often, insiders are simply uninterested in empathizing with
outsiders—but even that can cause people to neglect opportunities for
constructive collaboration across functions or organizations.</p>
<p>Problem #3: It can erode ethics</p>
<p>Finally, empathy can cause lapses in ethical judgment. We saw some of
that in the study about terrorists. In many cases, though, the problem
stems not from aggression toward outsiders but, rather, from extreme
loyalty toward insiders. In making a focused effort to see and feel
things the way people who are close to us do, we may take on their
interests as our own. This can make us more willing to overlook
transgressions or even behave badly ourselves.</p>
<p>Multiple studies in behavioral science and decision making show that
people are more inclined to cheat when it serves another person.4 In
various settings, with the benefits ranging from financial to
reputational, people use this ostensible altruism to rationalize their
dishonesty. It only gets worse when they empathize with another’s plight
or feel the pain of someone who is treated unfairly: In those cases,
they’re even more likely to lie, cheat, or steal to benefit that
person.</p>
<p>In the workplace, empathy toward fellow employees can inhibit
whistle-blowing—and when that happens, it seems scandals often follow.
Just ask the police, the military, Penn State University, Citigroup,
JPMorgan, and WorldCom. The kinds of problems that have plagued those
organizations—brutality, sexual abuse, fraud—tend to be exposed by
outsiders who don’t identify closely with the perpetrators.</p>
<p>In my research with Liane Young and James Dungan of Boston College,
we studied the effects of loyalty on people using Amazon’s Mechanical
Turk, an online marketplace where users earn money for completing tasks.
At the beginning of the study, we asked some participants to write an
essay about loyalty and others to write about fairness. Later in the
study, they were each exposed to poor work by someone else. Those who
had received the loyalty nudge were less willing to blow the whistle on
a fellow user for inferior performance. This finding complements
research showing that bribery is more common in countries that prize
collectivism.5 The sense of group belonging and interdependence among
members often leads people to tolerate the offense. It makes them feel
less accountable for it, diffusing responsibility to the collective
whole instead of assigning it to the individual.</p>
<p>In short, empathy for those within one’s immediate circle can
conflict with justice for all.</p>
<p>How to rein in excessive empathy</p>
<p>These three problems may seem intractable, but as a manager you can
do a number of things to mitigate them in your organization.</p>
<p>Split up the work</p>
<p>You might start by asking each employee to zero in on a certain set
of stakeholders, rather than empathize with anyone and everyone. Some
people can focus primarily on customers, for instance, and others on
coworkers—think of it as creating task forces to meet different
stakeholders’ needs. This makes the work of developing relationships and
gathering perspectives less consuming for individuals. You’ll also
accomplish more in the aggregate, by distributing “caring”
responsibilities across your team or company. Although empathy is finite
for any one person, it’s less bounded when managed across employees.</p>
<p>Make it less of a sacrifice</p>
<p>Our mindsets can either intensify or lessen our susceptibility to
empathy overload. For example, we exacerbate the zero-sum problem when
we assume that our own interests and others’ are fundamentally opposed.
(This often happens in deal making, when parties with different
positions on an issue get stuck because they’re obsessed with the gap
between them.) An adversarial mindset not only prevents us from
understanding and responding to the other party but also makes us feel
as though we’ve “lost” when we don’t get our way. We can avoid burnout
by seeking integrative solutions that serve both sides’ interests.</p>
<p>Take this example: A salary negotiation between a hiring manager and
a promising candidate will become a tug-of-war contest if they have
different numbers in mind and fixate on the money alone. But let’s
suppose that the candidate actually cares more about job security, and
the manager is keenly interested in avoiding turnover. Building security
into the contract would be a win-win: an empathic act by the manager
that wouldn’t drain his empathy reserves the way making a concession on
salary would, because keeping new hires around is in line with his own
desires.</p>
<p>There’s only so much empathy to go around, but it’s possible to
achieve economies of sorts. By asking questions instead of letting
assumptions go unchecked, you can bring such solutions to the
surface.</p>
<p>Give people breaks</p>
<p>As a management and organizations professor, I cringe when students
refer to my department’s course work—on leadership, teams, and
negotiation—as “soft skills.” Understanding and responding to the needs,
interests, and desires of other human beings involves some of the
hardest work of all. Despite claims that empathy comes naturally, it
takes arduous mental effort to get into another person’s mind—and then
to respond with compassion rather than indifference.</p>
<p>We all know that people need periodic relief from technical and
analytical work and from rote jobs like data entry. The same is true of
empathy. Look for ways to give employees breaks. It’s not sufficient to
encourage self-directed projects that also benefit the company (and
often result in more work), as Google did with its 20% time policy.
Encourage individuals to take time to focus on their interests alone.
Recent research finds that people who take lots of self-focused breaks
subsequently report feeling more empathy for others.6 That might seem
counterintuitive, but when people feel restored, they’re better able to
perform the demanding tasks of figuring out and responding to what
others need.</p>
<p>How do you give people respite from thinking and caring about others?
Some companies are purchasing isolation chambers like Orrb Technologies’
wellness and learning pods so that people can literally put themselves
in a bubble to relax, meditate, or do whatever else helps them recharge.
McLaren, for example, uses the pods to train F1 supercar drivers to
focus. Other companies, such as electrical parts distributor Van Meter,
are relying on much simpler interventions like shutting off employee
email accounts when workers go on vacation to allow them to concentrate
on themselves without interruption.</p>
<p>Despite its limitations, empathy is essential at work. So managers
should make sure employees are investing it wisely.</p>
<p>When trying to empathize, it’s generally better to talk with people
about their experiences than to imagine how they might be feeling, as
Nicholas Epley suggests in his book Mindwise. A recent study bears this
out.7 Participants were asked how capable they thought blind people were
of working and living independently. But before answering the question,
some were asked to complete difficult physical tasks while wearing a
blindfold. Those who had done the blindness simulation judged blind
people to be much less capable. That’s because the exercise led them to
ask “What would it be like if I were blind?” (the answer: very
difficult!) rather than “What is it like for a blind person to be
blind?” This finding speaks to why Ford’s use of the Empathy Belly,
while well-intentioned, may be misguided: After wearing it, engineers
may overestimate or misidentify the difficulties faced by drivers who
actually are pregnant.</p>
<p>Talking to people—asking them how they feel, what they want, and what
they think—may seem simplistic, but it’s more accurate. It’s also less
taxing to employees and their organizations, because it involves
collecting real information instead of endlessly speculating. It’s a
smarter way to empathize.</p>
