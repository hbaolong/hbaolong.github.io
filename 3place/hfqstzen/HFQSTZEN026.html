<h4 id="being-happy-at-work-matters">2 Being Happy at Work Matters</h4>
<p>By Annie McKee</p>
<p>People used to believe that you didn’t have to be happy at work to
succeed. And you didn’t need to like the people you worked with, or even
share their values. “Work is not personal,” the thinking went. This is
bunk.</p>
<p>My research with dozens of companies and hundreds of people—along
with the research conducted by neuroscientists like Richard Davidson and
V.S. Ramachandran and scholars such as Shawn Achor—increasingly points
to a simple fact: Happy people are better workers. Those who are engaged
with their jobs and colleagues work harder—and smarter.</p>
<p>And yet, an alarmingly high number of people aren’t engaged.
According to a sobering 2013 Gallup report, only 30% of the U.S.
workforce is engaged. This echoes what I’ve seen in my work. Not very
many people are truly “emotionally and intellectually committed” to
their organizations.1 Far too many couldn’t care less about what’s
happening around them. For them, Wednesday is “hump day” and they’re
just working to get to Friday. And then there’s the other end of the
bell curve—the nearly one out of five employees who is actively
disengaged, according to the same Gallup report. These people are
sabotaging projects, backstabbing colleagues, and generally wreaking
havoc in their workplaces.</p>
<p>The Gallup report also notes that employee engagement has remained
largely constant over the years despite economic ups and downs. Scary:
We’re not engaged with work, and we haven’t been for a long time.</p>
<p>Disengaged, unhappy people aren’t any fun to work with and don’t add
much value; they impact our organizations (and our economy) in
profoundly negative ways. It’s even worse when leaders are disengaged
because they infect others with their attitude. Their emotions and
mindsets impact others’ moods and performance tremendously. After all,
how we feel is linked to what and how we think. In other words, thought
influences emotion, and emotion influences thinking.2</p>
<p>It’s time to finally blow up the myth that feelings don’t matter at
work. Science is on our side: There are clear neurological links between
feelings, thoughts, and actions.3 When we are in the grip of strong
negative emotions, it’s like having blinders on. We focus
mostly—sometimes only—on the source of the pain. We don’t process
information as well, think creatively, or make good decisions.
Frustration, anger, and stress cause an important part of us to shut
down—the part that’s thinking and engaged.4 Disengagement is a natural
neurological and psychological response to pervasive negative
emotions.</p>
<p>But it’s not just negative emotions we need to watch out for.
Extremely strong positive emotions can have the same effect.5 Some
studies show that too much happiness can make you less creative and
prone to engaging in riskier behaviors (think about how we act like
fools when we fall in love). On the work front: I’ve seen groups of
people worked up into a frenzy at sales conferences and corporate pep
rallies. Little learning or innovation comes out of these meetings.
Throw in a lot of alcohol, and you’ve got a whole host of problems.</p>
<p>If we can agree that our emotional states at work matter, what can we
do to increase engagement and improve performance?</p>
<p>Over the past few years, my team at the Teleos Leadership Institute
and I have studied dozens of organizations and interviewed thousands of
people. The early findings about the links between people’s feelings and
engagement are fascinating. There are clear similarities in what people
say they want and need, no matter where they are from, whom they work
for, or what field they’re in. We often assume that there are huge
differences across industries and around the world, but the research
challenges that assumption.</p>
<p>To be fully engaged and happy, virtually everyone tells, we need
three things:</p>
<p>A meaningful vision of the future. When people talked with our
research team about what was working and what wasn’t in their
organizations and what helped or hindered them the most, they talked
about vision. People want to be able to see the future and know how they
fit in. And, as we know from our work with organizational behavior
expert Richard Boyatzis on intentional change, people learn and change
when they have a personal vision that is linked to an organizational
vision.6 Sadly, far too many leaders don’t paint a very compelling
vision of the future, they don’t try to link it to people’s personal
visions, and they don’t communicate well. And they lose people as a
result.</p>
<p>A sense of purpose. People want to feel as if their work matters,
that their contributions help achieve something really important. And
except for those at the tippy top, shareholder value isn’t a meaningful
goal that excites and engages them. They want to know that they—and
their organizations—are doing something big that matters to other
people.</p>
<p>Great relationships. We know that people join an organization and
leave a boss.7 A dissonant relationship with one’s boss is downright
painful. So too are bad relationships with colleagues. Leaders,
managers, and employees have all told us that close, trusting, and
supportive relationships are hugely important to their state of mind—and
their willingness contribute to a team.</p>
<p>Added up, brain science and organizational research are in fact
debunking the old myths: Emotions matter a lot at work. Happiness is
important. To be fully engaged, people need vision, meaning, purpose,
and resonant relationships.</p>
<p>It’s on us as individuals to find ways to live our values at work and
build great relationships. And it’s on leaders to create an environment
where people can thrive. It’s simple and it’s practical: If you want an
engaged workforce, pay attention to how you create a vision, link
people’s work to your company’s larger purpose, and reward individuals
who resonate with others.</p>
