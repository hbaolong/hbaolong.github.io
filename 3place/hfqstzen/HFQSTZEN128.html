<h4 id="use-your-everyday-privilege-to-help-others">10 Use Your Everyday
Privilege to Help Others</h4>
<p>By Dolly Chugh</p>
<p>I often forget I am straight. I just don’t think about it much. When
asked what I did this weekend, or when setting family photos on my desk
at work, I have no reason to wonder if what I say will make someone
uncomfortable, or lead to a joke at my expense, or cause a coworker to
suddenly think I am attracted to them. Our culture is set up for
straight people like me to be ourselves with very little thought. But
for some gay colleagues, a simple question about the weekend or a
decision of how to decorate the workspace carries significant stress—how
to act, who to trust, what to share. A recent study found that 46% of
LGBTQ employees are closeted in the workplace, for reasons ranging from
fear of losing their job to being stereotyped.1 Unlike me, a
non-straight person lacks the privilege of going an entire day without
remembering their sexual orientation.</p>
<p>This privilege of being able to forget part of who you are is not
unique to straight people. Each of us has some part of our identity that
requires little attention to protecting ourselves from danger,
discrimination, or doltish humor. For example, in America, if you are
white or Christian or able-bodied or straight or English-speaking, these
particular identities are easy to forget. It is just an “ordinary” way
of being. Ordinary privilege is ordinary because it blends in with the
norms and people around us and, thus, is easily forgotten.</p>
<p>Just about every person in America has one form or another of this
ordinary privilege. This is nothing to be ashamed of, or deny, even
though it can often feel like an accusation. Ordinary privilege is
actually an opportunity. Research repeatedly confirms that those with
ordinary privilege have the power to speak up on behalf of those without
it, and have particularly effective influence when they do. For so many
of us looking for an opportunity to fight bigotry and bias in the
workplace or in our broader culture, we may be missing the opportunity
staring back at us in the mirror: using the ordinary nature of who we
are as a source of extraordinary power.</p>
<p>For example, psychologists Heather Rasinski and Alexander Czopp
looked at how people perceive confrontations about a racially biased
comment.2 They found white observers were more persuaded by white
confronters than by black confronters and rated the black confronters as
more rude. Whiteness gave the person more legitimacy than blackness when
speaking up on racial bias.</p>
<p>Similarly, scholars David Hekman, Stefanie Johnson, Maw-Der Foo, and
Wei Yang studied what happens to people who try to advocate for
diversity in the workplace.3 Those who were female and nonwhite were
rated worse by their bosses than their nondiversity-advocating female
and nonwhite counter parts. White and male executives saw no difference
in their ratings, whether or not they advocated for diversity. They
found the same pattern with hiring decisions. If a white male manager
hired someone who looked like him (or someone who did not), it had no
impact either way on his performance ratings. But, if a nonwhite male
manager hired someone who looked like him, he took a hit for it. In
other words, ordinary privilege—that part of our identities which we
think less about—is also the place where we wield outsized influence on
behalf of others.</p>
<p>This influence even exists online, as political scientist Kevin
Munger showed through a clever experiment on Twitter, focused on people
using the n-word in a harassing way toward others online.4 Using bots
with either black or white identities, he tweeted at the harassers, “Hey
man, just remember that there are real people who are hurt when you
harass them with that kind of language.” This mild tweet from a “white”
bot who appeared to have 500 followers led to a reduction in the racist
online harassment in the seven-day period following the tweet, whereas
the same tweet from a “black” bot with the same number of followers had
little effect (interestingly, only anonymous n-word users were affected;
those using what appeared to be a real name and photo were unaffected by
the confrontation). If this is the effect a mild tweet from a stranger
can have, we have to wonder about the potential impact of our own
ordinary privilege.</p>
<p>To use your ordinary privilege, here are some things you can do:</p>
<p>First, figure out the parts of your identity that you think about
least. Once you’ve pinpointed them, you’ve identified your ordinary
privilege.</p>
<p>Second, start learning what people who lack that ordinary privilege
encounter as challenges at work, at school, and in their communities.
You can use the internet as a good starting point for first-person
accounts.</p>
<p>Third, look for opportunities to speak and act. Confronting people is
only one of many ways we can use our ordinary privilege. Instead, we can
ask questions, raise issues, and add perspectives that are not
organically emerging in discussions at work. We can introduce data,
invite people into conversations, and create buzz around ideas. We can
amplify the views of people not being heard at meetings, and bring back
conversations when someone is interrupted. We can give credit for
people’s work and spread the word about their talent. We can notice when
bias is playing out around us, and name it when it happens.</p>
<p>Fourth, be thoughtful about moments when you may inadvertently speak
over the group you mean to support. It is not unusual to accidentally
center ourselves instead of the people to whom we are trying to be an
ally, but it is costly. When it happens, step aside or step back, and
learn from those whose lives are directly affected by the issue, rather
than presenting yourself as the expert. Take their lead while using your
ordinary privilege.</p>
<p>What we think about least may be the place from which we can do the
most good. Each of us has some form of ordinary privilege, and that’s
good news, because that means almost all of us have more influence than
we may realize.</p>
