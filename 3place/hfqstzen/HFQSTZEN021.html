<h4 id="to-win-people-over-speak-to-their-wants-and-needs">5 To Win
People Over, Speak to Their Wants and Needs</h4>
<p>By Nancy Duarte</p>
<p>Practicing empathy can be difficult, because you have to step outside
your comfort zone to understand someone else’s point of view. But it’s
essential to exercising influence.</p>
<p>It’s how method actors move us to feel, think, or act
differently—they deeply immerse themselves in their characters, trying
on new ways of being and behaving. Sometimes their identity experiments
are even part of the story line, as in Being John Malkovich, Avatar, and
Tootsie.</p>
<p>During Tootsie, walking in the shoes of a woman had such a profound
impact on Dustin Hoffman that, 30 years later, recalling his decision to
make the film brought tears to his eyes in an interview with the
American Film Institute.</p>
<p>Before agreeing to work on the movie, Hoffman did some makeup tests
to see if he would be believable as a woman. When he discovered that he
could pass, but he wouldn’t be beautiful, he realized he had to do this
project. As he explained to his wife: “I think I’m an interesting woman
[as Dorothy Michaels]. And I know that if I met myself at a party, I
wouldn’t talk to that character because she doesn’t fulfill physically
the demands that we’re brought up to think women have to have in order
for us to ask them out . . . There’s too many interesting women I have
not had the experience to know in this life because I’ve been
brainwashed.” Empathy made Hoffman’s performance—and the film’s
message—more convincing and powerful.</p>
<p>The same thing happens in business all the time. Whether you’re
trying to get your team on board with a new way of working, asking
investors to fund you, persuading customers to buy your product, or
imploring the public to donate to your cause, your success depends on
your ability to grasp the wants and needs of the people around you.
We’ve seen this over and over again at my firm as we’ve created
presentations for clients and coached them on effective delivery. If
people feel listened to, they become more receptive to your message. And
by doing the listening, you become more informed about what they really
need—not just what you think they need—which will fuel your
relationships with stakeholders over the long run.</p>
<p>How do you build your capacity for empathy? Exercises can help, and
they’re used in many fields. Secret shoppers pose as retail customers
and record their observations. Product developers brainstorm use cases
and interview consumers to envision how they’ll interact with a product.
Negotiators do role-playing to imagine opposing points of view before
they get to the table.</p>
<p>Once you’ve started to develop empathy as a skill, you can make it
integral to the work you do. You might try visualizing stakeholders’
various perspectives the way Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky and his team did.
As described in a Fast Company post, they storyboarded the guest, host,
and hiring processes—inspired by Disney’s filmmaking. They created a
list of the key moments in these three experiences and then developed
the most important and most emotionally charged ones into fuller
narratives. Cofounder Nathan Blecharczyk says they learned a lot: “What
the storyboards made clear is that we were missing a big part of the
picture. . . . There were a lot of important moments where we weren’t
doing anything.” The storyboards ended up helping the company define its
mobile strategy and even inspired new features, which allowed Airbnb to
connect with traveling customers wherever the customers were.1</p>
<p>It’s also essential to listen carefully to your stakeholders and
check your understanding of what’s being said. Arbitrators do this to
get a handle on what both sides need in a dispute, before trying to
carve out a solution. Executives who are new to a company often embark
on listening tours with employees and customers to get their perspective
on issues and opportunities.</p>
<p>That’s what Lou Gerstner did in the 1990s, when the board at IBM
brought him in to turn around the almost bankrupt company. Gerstner
called his listening tour Operation Bear Hug. He gave managers three
months to meet with customers and ask about issues they were grappling
with and how IBM could help. Managers then had to recap the
conversations in memos. Gerstner also called customers on his own every
day. And he “bear-hugged” employees by touring IBM’s various sites and
hosting gatherings to share updates, test ideas, and tackle concerns. He
held 90-minute unscripted QandandandandA sessions with the staff, during
which he would talk to 20,000 workers directly.</p>
<p>“I listened, and I tried very hard not to draw conclusions,” Gerstner
said.</p>
<p>It was an important step in the strategy-making process, one that
enabled the executive team to build plans to make IBM relevant and
competitive again. But it led to an even larger shift in IBM’s culture
that transformed the company from an inwardly focused bureaucracy to a
market-driven innovator.</p>
<p>Empathize with the people you need to persuade to purchase your
product or services or to work hard on your behalf. It gives you better
ideas, and it makes you worth listening to. And if your stakeholders can
empathize with you in return, you’re on your way to building real,
lasting relationships with them.</p>
