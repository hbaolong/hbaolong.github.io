<h4 id="resilience-for-the-rest-of-us">4 Resilience for the Rest of
Us</h4>
<p>By Daniel Goleman</p>
<p>There are two ways to become more resilient: one by talking to
yourself, the other by retraining your brain.</p>
<p>If you’ve suffered a major failure, take the sage advice given by
psychologist Martin Seligman in the HBR article “Building Resilience”
(April 2011). Talk to yourself. Give yourself a cognitive intervention,
and counter defeatist thinking with an optimistic attitude. Challenge
your downbeat thinking, and replace it with a positive outlook.</p>
<p>Fortunately, major failures come along rarely in life.</p>
<p>But what about bouncing back from the more frequent annoying
screwups, minor setbacks, and irritating upsets that are routine in any
leader’s life? Resilience is, again, the answer—but with a different
flavor. You need to retrain your brain.</p>
<p>The brain has a very different mechanism for bouncing back from the
cumulative toll of daily hassles. And with a little effort, you can
upgrade its ability to snap back from life’s downers.</p>
<p>Whenever we get so upset that we say or do something we later regret
(and who doesn’t now and then?), that’s a sure sign that our
amygdala—the brain’s radar for danger and the trigger for the
fight-or-flight response—has hijacked the brain’s executive centers in
the prefrontal cortex. The neural key to resilience lies in how quickly
we recover from that hijacked state.</p>
<p>The circuitry that brings us back to full energy and focus after an
amygdala hijack concentrates in the left side of our prefrontal area,
says Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin.
He’s also found that when we’re distressed, there’s heightened activity
on the right side of the prefrontal area. Each of us has a
characteristic level of left/right activity that predicts our daily mood
range—if we’re tilted to the right, more upsets; if to the left, we’re
quicker to recover from distress of all kinds.</p>
<p>To tackle this in the workplace, Davidson teamed with the CEO of a
high-pressure, 24/7, biotech startup and meditation expert Jon
Kabat-Zinn of the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Kabat-Zinn
offered the employees at the biotech outfit instruction in mindfulness,
an attention-training method that teaches the brain to register anything
happening in the present moment with full focus—but without
reacting.</p>
<p>The instructions are simple:</p>
<p>Find a quiet, private place where you can be undistracted for a few
minutes. For instance, close your office door and mute your phone.</p>
<p>Sit comfortably, with your back straight but relaxed.</p>
<p>Focus your awareness on your breath, staying attentive to the
sensations of the inhalation and exhalation, and start again on the next
breath.</p>
<p>Do not judge your breathing or try to change it in any way.</p>
<p>See anything else that comes to mind as a distraction—thoughts,
sounds, whatever. Let them go and return your attention to your
breath.</p>
<p>After eight weeks and an average of 30 minutes a day practicing
mindfulness, the employees had shifted their ratio from tilted toward
the stressed-out right side to leaning toward the resilient left side.
What’s more, they said they remembered what they loved about their work:
They got in touch with what had brought them energy in the first
place.</p>
<p>To get the full benefit of mindfulness, a daily practice of 20 to 30
minutes works best. Think of it like a mental exercise routine. It can
be very helpful to have guided instructions, but the key is to find a
slot for the practice in your daily routine. (There are even
instructions for using a long drive as your practice session.)</p>
<p>Mindfulness has steadily been gaining credence among hard-nosed
executives. There are centers where mindfulness instruction has been
tailored to businesspeople, from tony resorts like Miraval Resort in
Arizona to programs in mindful leadership at the University of
Massachusetts Medical School. Google University has been offering a
course in mindfulness to employees for years.</p>
<p>Might you benefit from tuning up your brain’s resilience circuitry by
learning to practice mindfulness? Among high-performing executives, the
effects of stress can be subtle. My colleagues Richard Boyatzis and
Annie McKee suggest as a rough diagnostic of leadership stress asking
yourself, “Do I have a vague sense of unease, restlessness, or the
feeling that life is not great (a higher standard than ‘good enough’)?”
A bit of mindfulness might put your mind at ease.</p>
