<h4 id="too-much-charisma-can-make-leaders-look-less-effective">6 Too
Much Charisma Can Make Leaders Look Less Effective</h4>
<p>By Jasmine Vergauwe, Bart Wille, Joeri Hofmans, Robert B. Kaiser, and
Filip de Fruyt</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom suggests that the most charismatic leaders are
also the best leaders. Charismatic leaders have, for instance, the
ability to inspire others toward higher levels of performance and to
instill deep levels of commitment, trust, and satisfaction. As a result,
they are generally perceived by their subordinates to be more effective,
compared with less charismatic leaders.1</p>
<p>But our research shows that while having at least a moderate level of
charisma is important, having too much may hinder a leader’s
effectiveness. We conducted three studies, involving 800 business
leaders globally and around 7,500 of their superiors, peers, and
subordinates. Leaders occupied different managerial levels, ranging from
supervisors to general managers. Our paper is forthcoming in the Journal
of Personality and Social Psychology.</p>
<p>First, it’s important to understand what charisma is. Traditional
models of charismatic leadership state that charisma is not a
personality trait, but simply exists in the eye of the beholder. In
other words, charisma is attributed to someone, as opposed to being
grounded in one’s personality.2</p>
<p>However, the observation that people tend to agree in their
perceptions of others’ charisma levels suggests that it is not only a
matter of attribution, and that this agreement might result from a
personality-based foundation underlying these perceptions.3 So the first
goal of our research was to establish a measure of charismatic
personality.</p>
<p>We gave leaders the Hogan Development Survey (HDS), a personality
inventory specifically designed for work applications, and looked at how
they scored on four personality tendencies: bold, colorful, mischievous,
and imaginative. More-charismatic leaders score high on these traits,
which is reflected in their high self-confidence, dramatic flair,
readiness to test the limits, and expansive visionary thinking.</p>
<p>Next, we conducted a study to confirm this cluster of traits as a
valid measure of charismatic personality. Using a sample of 204 business
leaders, we showed that charismatic personality related to subordinates’
perceptions of charismatic leadership. So leaders with a highly
charismatic personality, as measured with HDS charisma, were also
perceived to be highly charismatic by their subordinates. Using an
archival data set from 1998 on a sample of 156 people, we further showed
that HDS charisma levels could be predicted by people’s charismatic
behaviors (for example, being energetic, assertive, and generating
enthusiasm).4</p>
<p>Our second goal was to investigate the relationship between
charismatic personality and leader effectiveness. In a second study, 306
leaders (65% of them men) provided HDS self-ratings of their charismatic
personality, while their coworkers provided ratings of their overall
effectiveness using a 10-point rating scale, where 5 is adequate and 10
is outstanding. Taken together, 4,345 of their coworkers participated in
this study: 666 superiors; 1,659 peers; and 2,020 subordinates. An
average of 14 people rated each leader in terms of overall
effectiveness.</p>
<p>Consistent with our expectations, we found that as charisma
increased, so did perceived effectiveness—but only up to a certain
point. As charisma scores continued to increase beyond the 60th
percentile, which is just above the average score relative to the
general population of working adults, perceived effectiveness started to
decline. This trend was consistent across the three observer groups
(subordinates, peers, and supervisors).</p>
<p>We also asked the leaders to evaluate their own effectiveness. As
shown later, the more charismatic the leaders were, the higher they
rated their own effectiveness. This discrepancy between self-perceptions
and observer ratings is in line with other research demonstrating that
leaders with high self-esteem typically overrate their performance on a
variety of criteria.5</p>
<p>In a third study, we tested whether the effects of charismatic
personality on effectiveness could be explained by looking at specific
leader behaviors. To test this, we asked 287 business leaders (81% men)
to rate their charismatic personality, and an average of 11
coworkers—including supervisors, peers, and subordinates—to rate each
leader in terms of overall effectiveness. Additionally, coworkers now
also rated leaders on two pairs of opposing leader-behavior dimensions:
the extent to which they were forceful and enabling (tapping into the
interpersonal behavior dimensions, or how they led), and the extent to
which they were strategic and operational (representing the
organizational dimensions, or what they led).</p>
<p>Although we did not find significant relationships between charisma
and the interpersonal behavior dimensions, we found that highly
charismatic leaders were perceived to engage in more strategic behavior
and less operational behavior. But how can this explain lower
effectiveness ratings for the most charismatic?</p>
<p>One explanation is that the costs associated with the desired trait
(charisma) eventually come to outweigh its benefits. For highly
charismatic leaders, we expected that the costs associated with a lack
of operational behavior would come to outweigh the benefits delivered by
strategic behavior when a certain level of charisma is exceeded. And
that’s exactly what we found: Highly charismatic leaders may be
strategically ambitious, but this comes at the expense of getting
day-to-day work activities executed in a proper manner, which can hurt
perceived effectiveness. They failed, for example, in managing the
day-to-day operations needed to implement their big strategic vision and
in taking a methodical approach to getting things done in the near term.
Further analysis showed that for leaders with lower levels of charisma,
the opposite was true: They were found to be less effective because they
lacked strategic behavior. For example, they did not spend enough time
on long-term planning, and failed in taking a big-picture perspective,
questioning the status quo, and encouraging innovation.</p>
<p>In terms of practical implications, our findings suggest that leaders
should be aware of the potential drawbacks of being highly charismatic.
Although it’s difficult to draw a precise line between “just enough” and
“too much” charisma, these are a few traits to look out for that can
influence one’s effectiveness. Self-confidence, for instance, may turn
into overconfidence and narcissism in highly charismatic leaders, while
risk tolerance and persuasiveness may start to translate into
manipulative behavior. Further, the enthusiastic and entertaining nature
of charisma may turn into attention-seeking behaviors that distract the
organization from its mission, and extreme creativity may make highly
charismatic leaders think and act in fanciful, eccentric ways.</p>
<p>For those whose charisma may be above optimal, coaching and
development programs aimed at managing potential operational weaknesses,
enhancing self-awareness, and improving self-regulation can be useful.
Highly charismatic leaders would also benefit from receiving feedback
from their coworkers on their effectiveness. That way, any gap between
their perception and the perceptions of others will become clear. In
contrast, coaching programs for leaders low on charisma might focus more
on boosting their strategic behavior.</p>
<p>In sum, we found support for the idea that a leader can be too
charismatic. Our findings suggest that highly charismatic leaders are
perceived to be less effective, not for interpersonal reasons like
self-centeredness but for business-related reasons that specifically
relate to a lack of operational leader behavior.</p>
<p>We do want to point out that we didn’t include situational factors in
our study, which could influence the strength and shape of the
relationship between leader charisma and effectiveness. Under certain
conditions, such as in low-stress situations, this relationship may be
strictly linear (“the more charisma the better”). However, we believe
that high-stress and high-pressure situations are rather typical for a
“normal” leadership context, enhancing the likelihood of finding a
too-much-of-a-good-thing effect.6 Additional studies will be important
to further investigate the specific conditions under which charisma is
desirable or not.</p>
