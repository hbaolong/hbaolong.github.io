<h4 id="the-research-weve-ignored-about-happiness-at-work">6 The
Research We’ve Ignored About Happiness at Work</h4>
<p>By André Spicer and Carl Cederström</p>
<p>Recently, we found ourselves in motivational seminars at our
respective places of employment. Both events preached the gospel of
happiness. In one, a speaker explained that happiness could make you
healthier, kinder, more productive, and even more likely to get
promoted.</p>
<p>The other seminar involved mandatory dancing of the wilder kind. It
was supposed to fill our bodies with joy. It also prompted one of us to
sneak out and take refuge in the nearest bathroom.</p>
<p>Ever since a group of scientists switched the lights on and off at
the Hawthorne factory in the mid-1920s, scholars and executives alike
have been obsessed with increasing their employees’ productivity. In
particular, happiness as a way to boost productivity seems to have
gained traction in corporate circles as of late.1 Firms spend money on
happiness coaches, team-building exercises, gameplays, funsultants, and
chief happiness officers (yes, you’ll find one of those at Google).
These activities and titles may appear jovial or even bizarre, but
companies are taking them extremely seriously. Should they?</p>
<p>When you look closely at the research—which we did after the dancing
incident—it’s not clear that encouraging happiness at work is always a
good idea. Sure, there is evidence to suggest that happy employees are
less likely to leave, more likely to satisfy customers, are safer, and
more likely to engage in citizenship behavior.2 However, we also
discovered alternate findings, which indicates that some of the
taken-for-granted wisdoms about what happiness can achieve in the
workplace are mere myths.</p>
<p>To start, we don’t really know what happiness is or how to measure
it. Measuring happiness is about as easy as taking the temperature of
the soul or determining the exact color of love. As historian Darrin M.
McMahon shows in his illuminating book Happiness: A History, ever since
the sixth century BC, when Croesus is said to have quipped “No one who
lives is happy,” this slippery concept has served as a proxy for all
sorts of other concepts, from pleasure and joy to plenitude and
contentment. Being happy in the moment, Samuel Johnson said, could be
achieved only when drunk.3 For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, happiness was to
lie in a boat, drifting aimlessly, feeling like a God (not exactly the
picture of productivity). There are other definitions of happiness, too,
but they are neither less nor more plausible than those of Johnson or
Rousseau.</p>
<p>And just because we have more-advanced technology today doesn’t mean
we’re any closer to pinning down a definition, as Will Davies reminds us
in his book The Happiness Industry. He concludes that even as we have
developed more-advanced techniques for measuring emotions and predicting
behaviors, we have also adopted increasingly simplified notions of what
it means to be human, let alone what it means to pursue happiness. A
brain scan that lights up may seem like it’s telling us something
concrete about an elusive emotion, for example, when it actually
isn’t.</p>
<p>Happiness doesn’t necessarily lead to increased productivity. A
stream of research shows some contradictory results about the
relationship between happiness—which is often defined as “job
satisfaction”—and productivity.4 One study on British supermarkets even
suggests there might be a negative correlation between job satisfaction
and corporate productivity: The more miserable the employees were, the
better the profits.5 Sure, other studies have pointed in the opposite
direction, saying that there is a link between feeling content with work
and being productive. But even these studies, when considered as a
whole, demonstrate a relatively weak correlation.</p>
<p>Happiness can also be exhausting. The pursuit of happiness may not be
wholly effective, but it doesn’t really hurt, right? Wrong. Ever since
the eighteenth century, people have been pointing out that the demand to
be happy brings with it a heavy burden, a responsibility that can never
be perfectly fulfilled. Focusing on happiness can actually make us feel
less happy.</p>
<p>A psychological experiment recently demonstrated this.6 The
researchers asked their subjects to watch a film that would usually make
them happy: a figure skater winning a medal. But before watching the
film, half of the group was asked to read a statement aloud about the
importance of happiness in life. The other half did not read the
statement. The researchers were surprised to find that those who had
read the statement were actually less happy after watching the film.
Essentially, when happiness becomes a duty, it can make people feel
worse if they fail to accomplish it.</p>
<p>This is particularly problematic at the present era, in which
happiness is preached as a moral obligation.7 As the French philosopher
Pascal Bruckner put it, “Unhappiness is not only unhappiness; it is,
worse yet, a failure to be happy.”8</p>
<p>Happiness won’t necessarily get you through the workday. If you’ve
worked in a frontline customer service job, like a call center or a fast
food restaurant, you know that being upbeat is not optional—it’s
compulsory. And as tiring as that may be, it makes some sense when
you’re in front of customers.</p>
<p>But today, many non-customer-facing employees are also asked to be
upbeat. This could have some unforeseen consequences. One study found
that people who were in a good mood were worse at picking out acts of
deception than those who were in a bad mood.9 Another piece of research
found that people who were angry during a negotiation achieved better
outcomes than people who were happy.10 This suggests that being happy
may not be good for all aspects of our work or for jobs that rely
heavily on certain abilities. In fact, in some cases, happiness can
actually make our performance worse.</p>
<p>Happiness could damage your relationship with your boss. If we
believe that work is where we will find happiness, we might, in some
cases, start to mistake our boss for a surrogate spouse or parent. In
her study of a media company, researcher Susanne Ekmann found that those
who expected work to make them happy would often become emotionally
needy.11 They wanted their managers to provide them with a steady stream
of recognition and emotional reassurance. And when they didn’t receive
the expected emotional response (which was often), these employees felt
neglected and started overreacting. Even minor setbacks were interpreted
as being rejected by their bosses. So in many ways, expecting a boss to
bring happiness makes us emotionally vulnerable.</p>
<p>Happiness could also hurt your relationships with friends and family.
In her book Cold Intimacies, sociology professor Eva Illouz points out a
strange side effect of people trying to live more emotionally at work:
They started to treat their private lives like work tasks. The people
she spoke with saw their personal lives as something that needed to be
carefully administered using a range of tools and techniques they had
learned from corporate life. As a result, their home lives became
increasingly cold and calculating. It’s no wonder then that many of the
people she spoke with preferred to spend time at work rather than at
home.</p>
<p>Happiness could make losing your job that much more devastating. When
we expect the workplace to provide happiness and meaning in our lives,
we become dangerously dependent on it. When studying professionals,
sociology professor Richard Sennett noticed that people who saw their
employer as an important source of personal meaning were those who
became most devastated if they were fired.12 When these people lost
their jobs, they weren’t just losing an income—they were losing the
promise of happiness. This suggests that, when we see our work as a
great source of happiness, we make ourselves emotionally vulnerable
during periods of change. In an era of constant corporate restructuring,
this can be dangerous.</p>
<p>Happiness could also make you selfish. Being happy makes you a better
person, right? Not so, according to an interesting piece of research.13
Participants were given lottery tickets and then given a choice about
how many tickets they wanted to give to others and how many they wished
to keep for themselves. Those who were in a good mood ended up keeping
more tickets for themselves. This implies that, at least in some
settings, being happy doesn’t necessarily mean we will be generous. In
fact, the opposite could be true.</p>
<p>Finally, happiness could also make you lonely. In one experiment,
psychologists asked a number of people to keep a detailed diary for two
weeks. What they found at the end of the study was that those who
greatly valued happiness felt lonelier than those who valued happiness
less.14 It seems that focusing too much on the pursuit of happiness can
make us feel disconnected from other people.</p>
<p>So why, contrary to all of this evidence, do we continue to hold on
to the belief that happiness can improve a workplace? The answer,
according to one study, comes down to aesthetics and ideology. Happiness
is a convenient idea that looks good on paper (the aesthetic part). But
it’s also an idea that helps us shy away from more serious issues at
work, such as conflicts and workplace politics (the ideological
part).15</p>
<p>When we assume that happy workers are better workers, we may sweep
more uncomfortable questions under the rug, especially since happiness
is often seen as a choice. It becomes a convenient way of dealing with
negative attitudes, party poopers, miserable bastards, and other
unwanted characters in corporate life. Invoking happiness, in all its
ambiguity, is an excellent way of getting away with controversial
decisions, such as choosing to let people go. As Barbara Ehrenreich
points out in her book Bright-Sided, positive messages about happiness
have proved particularly popular in times of crisis and mass
layoffs.</p>
<p>Given all these potential problems, we think there is a strong case
for rethinking our expectation that work should always make us happy. It
can be exhausting, make us overreact, drain our personal life of
meaning, increase our vulnerability, and make us more gullible, selfish,
and lonely. Most striking is that consciously pursuing happiness can
actually drain the sense of joy we usually get from the really good
things we experience.</p>
<p>In reality, work—like all other aspects of life—is likely to make us
feel a wide range of emotions. If your job feels depressing and
meaningless, it might be because it is depressing and meaningless.
Pretending otherwise can just make it worse. Happiness, of course, is a
great thing to experience, but it can’t be willed into existence. Maybe
the less we seek to actively pursue happiness through our jobs, the more
likely we will be to actually experience a sense of joy in our work—a
joy that is spontaneous and pleasurable rather than constructed and
oppressive. But most important, we will be better equipped to cope with
work in a sober manner. To see it for what it is and not what we—whether
as executives, employees, or dancing motivational seminar
leaders—pretend that it is.</p>
