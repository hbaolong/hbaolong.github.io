Why You Should Make Time for Self-Reflection (Even if You Hate Doing
It)</h4>
<p>By Jennifer Porter</p>
<p>When people find out I’m an executive coach, they often ask who my
toughest clients are. Inexperienced leaders? Senior leaders who think
they know everything? Leaders who bully and belittle others? Leaders who
shirk responsibility?</p>
<p>The answer is none of the above. The hardest leaders to coach are
those who won’t reflect—particularly leaders who won’t reflect on
themselves.</p>
<p>At its simplest, reflection is about careful thought. But the kind of
reflection that is really valuable to leaders is more nuanced than that.
The most useful reflection involves the conscious consideration and
analysis of beliefs and actions for the purpose of learning. Reflection
gives the brain an opportunity to pause amid the chaos, untangle and
sort through observations and experiences, consider multiple possible
interpretations, and create meaning. This meaning becomes learning,
which can then inform future mind-sets and actions. For leaders, this
“meaning making” is crucial to their ongoing growth and development.</p>
<p>Research by Giada Di Stefano, Francesca Gino, Gary Pisano, and
Bradley Staats in call centers demonstrated that employees who spent 15
minutes at the end of the day reflecting about lessons learned performed
23% better after 10 days than those who did not reflect.1 A study of
U.K. commuters found a similar result when those who were prompted to
use their commute to think about and plan for their day were happier,
more productive, and less burned-out than people who didn’t.2</p>
<p>So, if reflection is so helpful, why don’t many leaders do it?
Leaders often:</p>
<p>Don’t understand the process. Many leaders don’t know how to reflect.
One executive I work with, Ken, shared recently that he had yet again
not met his commitment to spend an hour on Sunday mornings reflecting.
To help him get over this barrier, I suggested he take the next 30
minutes of our two-hour session and just quietly reflect and then we’d
debrief it. After five minutes of silence, he said, “I guess I don’t
really know what you want me to do. Maybe that’s why I haven’t been
doing it.”</p>
<p>Don’t like the process. Reflection requires leaders to do a number of
things they typically don’t like to do: slow down, adopt a mind-set of
not knowing and curiosity, tolerate messiness and inefficiency, and take
personal responsibility. The process can lead to valuable insights and
even breakthroughs—and it can also lead to feelings of discomfort,
vulnerability, defensiveness, and irritation.</p>
<p>Don’t like the results. When a leader takes time to reflect, she
typically sees ways she was effective as well as things she could have
done better. Most leaders quickly dismiss the noted strengths and
dislike the noted weaknesses. Some become so defensive in the process
that they don’t learn anything, so the results are not helpful.</p>
<p>Have a bias toward action. Like soccer goalies, many leaders have a
bias toward action. A study of professional soccer goalies defending
penalty kicks found that goalies who stay in the center of the goal,
instead of lunging left or right, have a 33% chance of stopping the
goal, and yet these goalies only stay in the center 6% of the time. The
goalies just feel better when they “do something.” The same is true of
many leaders. Reflection can feel like staying in the center of the goal
and missing the action.</p>
<p>Can’t see a good ROI. From early roles, leaders are taught to invest
where they can generate a positive ROI—results that indicate the
contribution of time, talent, or money paid off. Sometimes it’s hard to
see an immediate ROI on reflection, particularly when compared with
other uses of a leader’s time.</p>
<p>If you have found yourself making these same excuses, you can become
more reflective by practicing a few simple steps.</p>
<p>Identify some important questions. But don’t answer them yet. Here
are some possibilities: – What are you avoiding?</p>
<p>– How are you helping your colleagues achieve their goals?</p>
<p>– How are you not helping or even hindering their progress?</p>
<p>– How might you be contributing to your least enjoyable relationship
at work?</p>
<p>– How could you have been more effective in a recent meeting?</p>
<p>Select a reflection process that matches your preferences. Many
people reflect by writing in a journal. If that sounds terrible but
talking with a colleague sounds better consider that. As long as you’re
reflecting and not just chatting about the latest sporting event or
complaining about a colleague, your approach is up to you. You can sit,
walk, bike, or stand, alone or with a partner, writing, talking, or
thinking.</p>
<p>Schedule time. Most leaders are driven by their calendars. So,
schedule your reflection time and then commit to keep it. And if you
find yourself trying to skip it or avoid it, reflect on that!</p>
<p>Start small. If an hour of reflection seems like too much, try 10
minutes. Teresa Amabile and her colleagues found that the most
significant driver of positive emotions and motivation at work was
making progress on the tasks at hand. Set yourself up to make progress,
even if it feels small.3</p>
<p>Do it. Go back to your list of questions and explore them. Be still.
Think. Consider multiple perspectives. Look at the opposite of what you
initially believe. Brainstorm. You don’t have to like or agree with all
of your thoughts—just think and examine your thinking.</p>
<p>Ask for help. For most leaders, a lack of desire, time, experience,
or skill can get in the way of reflection. Consider working with a
colleague, therapist, or coach to help you make the time, listen
carefully, be a thought partner, and hold you accountable.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges to reflection, the impact is clear. As Peter
Drucker said: “Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the
quiet reflection will come even more effective action.”</p>
