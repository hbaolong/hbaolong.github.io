What the Dalai Lama Taught Daniel Goleman About Emotional
Intelligence</h4>
<p>An interview with Daniel Goleman by Andrea Ovans</p>
<p>Two decades before Daniel Goleman first wrote about emotional
intelligence in the pages of HBR, he met the Dalai Lama at Amherst
College. The Dalai Lama mentioned to the young science journalist for
the New York Times that he was interested in meeting with scientists.
Thus began a long, rich friendship as Goleman became involved over the
years in arranging a series of what he calls “extended dialogues”
between the Buddhist spiritual leader and researchers in fields ranging
from ecology to neuroscience. Over the next 30 years, as Goleman has
pursued his own work as a psychologist and business thinker, he has come
to see the Dalai Lama as a highly uncommon leader. And so he was
understandably delighted when, on the occasion of his friend’s 80th
birthday, he was asked to write a book describing the Dalai Lama’s
compassionate approach to addressing the world’s most intractable
problems. Published in June 2015, Force for Good: The Dalai Lama’s
Vision for Our World, which draws both on Goleman’s background in
cognitive science and his long relationship with the Dalai Lama, is both
an exploration of the science and the power of compassion and a call to
action. Curious about the book and about how the Dalai Lama’s views on
compassion informed Goleman’s thinking on emotional intelligence, I
caught up with Goleman over the phone. What follows are edited excerpts
from our conversation.</p>
<p>HBR: Let’s start with some definitions here. What is compassion, as
you are describing it? It sounds a lot like empathy, one of the major
components of emotional intelligence. Is there a difference?</p>
<p>Goleman: Yes, an important difference. As I’ve written about recently
in HBR, three kinds of empathy are important to emotional intelligence:
cognitive empathy—the ability to understand another person’s point of
view, emotional empathy—the ability to feel what someone else feels, and
empathic concern—the ability to sense what another person needs from you
[see chapter 1, “What Is Empathy?”]. Cultivating all three kinds of
empathy, which originate in different parts of the brain, is important
for building social relationships.</p>
<p>But compassion takes empathy a step further. When you feel
compassion, you feel distress when you witness someone else in
distress—and because of that you want to help that person.</p>
<p>Why draw this distinction?</p>
<p>Simply put, compassion makes the difference between understanding and
caring. It’s the kind of love that a parent has for a child. Cultivating
it more broadly means extending that to the other people in our lives
and to people we encounter. I think that in the workplace, that attitude
has a hugely positive effect, whether it’s in how we relate to our
peers, how we are as a leader, or how we relate to clients and
customers. A positive disposition toward another person creates the kind
of resonance that builds trust and loyalty and makes interactions
harmonious. And the opposite of that—when you do nothing to show that
you care—creates distrust and disharmony and causes huge dysfunction at
home and in business.</p>
<p>When you put it that way, it’s hard to disagree that if you treat
people well things would go better than if you don’t or that if you
cared about them they would care a lot more about you. So why do you
think that doesn’t just happen naturally? Is it a cultural thing? Or a
misplaced confusion about when competition is appropriate?</p>
<p>I think too often there’s a muddle in people’s thinking that if I’m
nice to another person or if I have their interests at heart it means
that I don’t have my own interests at heart. The pathology of that is,
“Well, I’ll just care about me and not the other person.” And that, of
course, is the kind of attitude that leads to lots of problems in the
business realm and in the personal realm. But compassion also includes
yourself. If we protect ourselves and make sure we’re okay—and also make
sure the other person is okay—that creates a different framework for
working with and cooperating with other people.</p>
<p>Could you give me an example of how that might work in the business
world?</p>
<p>There’s research that was done on star salespeople and on client
managers that found that the lowest level of performance was a kind of
“I’m going to get the best deal I can now, and I don’t care how this
affects the other person” attitude, which means that you might make the
sale but that you lose the relationship. But at the top end, the stars
were typified by the attitude, “I am working for the client as well as
myself. I’m going to be completely straight with them, and I’m going to
act as their advisor. If the deal I have is not the best deal they can
get I’m going to let them know because that’s going to strengthen the
relationship, even though I might lose this specific sale.” And I think
that captures the difference between the “me first” and the “let’s all
do well” attitude that I’m getting at.</p>
<p>How would we cultivate compassion if we just weren’t feeling it?</p>
<p>Neuroscientists have been studying compassion recently, and places
like Stanford, Yale, UC Berkeley, and the University of Wisconsin,
Madison, among others, have been testing methodologies for increasing
compassion. Right now there’s a kind of a trend toward incorporating
mindfulness into the workplace, and it turns out there’s data from the
Max Planck Institute showing that enhancing mindfulness does have an
effect in brain function but that the circuitry that’s affected is not
the circuitry for concern or compassion. In other words, there’s no
automatic boost in compassion from mindfulness alone.</p>
<p>Still, in the traditional methods of meditation that mindfulness in
the workplace is based on, the two were always linked, so that you would
practice mindfulness in a context in which you’d also cultivate
compassion.</p>
<p>Stanford, for example, has developed a program that incorporates
secularized versions of methods that have originally come from religious
practices. It involves a meditation in which you cultivate an attitude
of loving-kindness or of concern, or of compassion, toward people. First
you do this for yourself, then for people you love, then for people you
just know. And finally you do it for everyone. And this has the effect
of priming the circuitry responsible for compassion within the brain so
that you are more inclined to act that way when the opportunity
arises.</p>
<p>You’ve remarked that the Dalai Lama is a very distinctive kind of
leader. Is there something we could learn as leaders ourselves from his
unique form of leadership?</p>
<p>Observing him over the years, and then doing this book for which I
interviewed him extensively, and of course being immersed in leadership
literature myself, three things struck me.</p>
<p>The first is that he’s not beholden to any organization at all. He’s
not in any business. He’s not a party leader. He’s a citizen of the
world at large. And this has freed him to tackle the largest problems we
face. I think that to the extent that a leader is beholden to a
particular organization or outcome, that creates a kind of myopia of
what’s possible and what matters. Focus narrows to the next quarter’s
results or the next election. He’s way beyond that. He thinks in terms
of generations and of what’s best for humanity as a whole. Because his
vision is so expansive, he can take on the largest challenges, rather
than small, narrowly defined ones.</p>
<p>So I think there’s a lesson here for all of us, which is to ask
ourselves if there is something that limits our vision—that limits our
capacity to care. And is there a way to enlarge it?</p>
<p>The second thing that struck me is that he gathers information from
everywhere. He meets with heads of state, and he meets with beggars.
He’s getting information from people at every level of society
worldwide. This casting a large net lets him understand situations in a
very deep way, and he can analyze them in many different ways and come
up with solutions that aren’t confined by anyone. And I think that’s
another lesson everyday leaders can take from him.</p>
<p>The third thing would be the scope of his compassion, which I think
is an ideal that we could strive for. It’s pretty unlimited. He seems to
care about everybody and the world at large.</p>
<p>You’ve said that the book is a call to action. What do you hope
people will do after reading it?</p>
<p>The book is a call to action, but it is a very reasoned call to
action. The Dalai Lama is a great believer in a deep analysis of
problems and letting solutions come from that analysis. And then he is
also passionate about people acting now. Not feeling passive, not
feeling helpless, not feeling, “What’s the point? I won’t live to see
the benefit,” but rather having them start changes now even if the
change won’t come to fruition until future generations.</p>
<p>So my hope, and his, is to help people understand what they can do in
the face of problems that are so vast: creating a more inclusive
economy; making work meaningful; doing good and not just well; cleaning
up injustice and unfairness, corruption and collusion in society,
whether in business, politics, or religion; helping the environment
heal; the hope that one day conflict will be settled by dialogue rather
than war.</p>
<p>These are very big issues. But everyone can do something to move
things in the right direction, even if it’s just reaching across the
divide and becoming friendly with someone who belongs to some other
group. That actually has a very powerful end result: If you have two
groups somewhere in the world that have deep enmity toward each other,
and yet a few people in each group like each other because they’ve had
personal contact—they have a friend in that other group. So something as
simple as reaching out across a divide is actually a profound thing. In
each of these areas, with whatever leverage we have, the point is to use
it, not just to stand back.</p>
