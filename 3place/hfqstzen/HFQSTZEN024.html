When to Sell with Facts and Figures, and When to Appeal to Emotions</h4>
<p>By Michael D. Harris</p>
<p>When should salespeople sell with facts and figures, and when should
they try to speak to the buyer’s emotional subconscious instead? When do
you talk to Mr. Intuitive and when to Mr. Rational?</p>
<p>I’d argue that too often, selling to Mr. Rational leads to analysis
paralysis, especially for complex products or services. And yet many of
us continue to market almost exclusively to Mr. Rational. The result is
that we spend too much time chasing sales opportunities that eventually
stall out. We need to improve our ability to sell to Mr. Intuitive.</p>
<p>We default to selling to Mr. Rational because when we think of
ourselves, we identify with our conscious rational mind. We can’t
imagine that serious executives would make decisions based on emotion,
because we view our emotional decisions as irrational and
irresponsible.</p>
<p>But what if Mr. Intuitive has a logic of his own? In recent years,
psychologists and behavioral economists have shown that our emotional
decisions are neither irrational nor irresponsible. In fact, we now
understand that our unconscious decisions do in fact follow a clear
logic. They are based on a deeply empirical mental-processing system
that is capable of effortlessly cycling through millions of bits of data
without getting overwhelmed. Our conscious mind, on the other hand, has
a strict bottleneck, because it can only process three or four new
pieces of information at a time due to the limitations of our working
memory.1</p>
<p>The Iowa Gambling Task study, for example, highlights how effective
the emotional brain is at effortlessly figuring out the probability of
success for maximum gain.2 Subjects were given an imaginary budget and
four stacks of cards. The objective of the game was to win as much money
as possible, and to do so, subjects were instructed to draw cards from
any of the four decks.</p>
<p>The subjects were not aware that the decks were carefully prepared.
Drawing from two of the decks led to consistent wins, while the other
two had high payouts but carried oversized punishments. The logical
choice was to avoid the dangerous decks, and after about 50 cards,
people did stop drawing from the risky decks. It wasn’t until the 80th
card, however, that people could explain why. Logic is slow.</p>
<p>But the researchers tracked the subjects’ anxiety and found that
people started to become nervous when reaching for the risky deck after
drawing only 10 cards. Intuition is fast.</p>
<p>Harvard Business School professor Gerald Zaltman says that 95% of our
purchase decisions take place unconsciously. But why, then, are we not
able to look back through our decision history and find countless
examples of emotional decisions? Because our conscious mind will always
make up reasons to justify our unconscious decisions.</p>
<p>In a study of people who’d had the left and right hemisphere of their
brains severed in order to prevent future epileptic seizures, scientists
were able to deliver a message to the right side of the brain to “Go to
the water fountain down the hall and get a drink.”3 After seeing the
message, the subject would get up and start to leave the room, and
that’s when the scientist would deliver a message to the opposite, left
side of the brain, asking, “Where are you going?” Now remember, the left
side of the brain never saw the message about the fountain. But did the
left brain admit it didn’t know the answer? No. Instead it shamelessly
fabricated a rational reason, something like, “It’s cold in here. I’m
going to get my jacket.”</p>
<p>So if you can’t reliably use your own decision-making history as a
guide, when do you know you should be selling based on logic and when on
emotion?</p>
<p>Here’s the short rule of thumb: Sell to Mr. Rational for simple sales
and to Mr. Intuitive for complex sales.</p>
<p>This conclusion is backed by a 2011 study based on subjects selecting
the best used car from a selection of four cars. Each car was rated in
four different categories (such as gas mileage). But one car clearly had
the best attributes. In this “easy” situation with only four variables,
the conscious deciders were 15% better at choosing the best car than the
unconscious deciders. When the researchers made the decision more
complex—ratcheting the number of variables up to 12—unconscious deciders
were 42% better than conscious deciders at selecting the best car. Many
other studies have shown how our conscious minds become overloaded by
too much information.</p>
<p>If you want to influence how a customer feels about your product,
provide an experience that creates the desired emotion. One of the best
ways for a customer to experience your complex product is by sharing a
vivid customer story. Research has shown that stories can activate the
region of the brain that processes sights, sounds, tastes, and
movement.4 Contrast this approach with that of a salesperson delivering
a data dump in the form of an 85-slide PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>Rather than thinking of the emotional mind as irrational, think of it
this way: An emotion is simply the way the unconscious communicates its
decision to the conscious mind.</p>
