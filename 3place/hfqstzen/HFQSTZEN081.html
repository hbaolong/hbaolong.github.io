<h4 id="cultivate-a-culture-of-confidence">9 Cultivate a Culture of
Confidence</h4>
<p>By Rosabeth Moss Kanter</p>
<p>One difference between winners and losers is how they handle
losing.</p>
<p>Even for the best companies and most accomplished professionals, long
track records of success are punctuated by slips, slides, and
mini-turnarounds. Even the team that wins the game might make mistakes,
fumble, and lag behind for part of it. That’s why the ability to recover
quickly and get back on course is so important.</p>
<p>Troubles are ubiquitous. Surprises can fall from the sky like
volcanic ash and appear to change everything. New ventures can begin
with great promise and still face unexpected obstacles, unanticipated
delays, and critics that pop up at the wrong moment. That’s why I coined
Kanter’s Law: “Anything can look like a failure in the middle.”</p>
<p>Nothing succeeds for long without considerable effort and constant
vigilance. Winning streaks end for predictable reasons: Strategies run
their course. New competition emerges to take on the industry leader.
Ideas get dusty. Technology marches on. Complacency sets in, making
people feel entitled to success rather than motivated to work for
it.</p>
<p>Thus, a key factor in high achievement is bouncing back from the low
points. Long-term winners often face the same problems as long-term
losers, but they respond differently, as I found in the research for my
book Confidence. I compared companies and sports teams with long winning
streaks and long losing streaks, and then looked at how leaders led
turnarounds from low to high performance.</p>
<p>Consider first the pathologies of losing. Losing produces temptations
to behave in ways that make it hard to recover fast enough—and could
even make the situation worse. For example, panicking and throwing out
the game plan. Scrambling for self-protection and abandoning the rest of
the group. Hiding the facts and hoping that things will get better by
themselves before anyone notices. Denying that there is anything to
learn or change. Using decline as an excuse to let facilities or
investments deteriorate.</p>
<p>The culture and support system that surrounds high performers helps
them avoid these temptations. They can put troubles in perspective
because they are ready for them. They rehearse through diligent practice
and preparation; they remain disciplined and professional. Their leaders
put facts on the table and review what went right or wrong in the last
round in order to shore up strengths and pinpoint weaknesses and to
encourage personal responsibility for actions. They stress collaboration
and teamwork—common goals; commitment to a joint vision; respect and
support for team members, so when someone drops the ball, someone else
is there to pick it up—and responsibility for mentoring, so the best
performers lift everyone’s capabilities. They seek creative ideas for
improvement and innovation, favoring widespread dialogue and
brainstorming.</p>
<p>Resilience is not simply an individual characteristic or a
psychological phenomenon. It is helped or hindered by the surrounding
system. Teams that are immersed in a culture of accountability,
collaboration, and initiative are more likely to believe that they can
weather any storm. Self-confidence, combined with confidence in one
another and in the organization, motivates winners to make the extra
push that can provide the margin of victory.</p>
<p>The lesson for leaders is clear: Build the cornerstones of
confidence—accountability, collaboration, and initiative—when times are
good and achievement comes easily. Maintain a culture of confidence as
insurance against the inevitable downturns. And while no one should
deliberately seek failure, remember that performance under pressure—the
ability to stay calm, learn, adapt, and keep on going—separates winners
from losers.</p>
