<h4 id="listening-to-people">3 Listening to People</h4>
<p>By Ralph G. Nichols and Leonard A. Stevens</p>
<p>Editor’s note: In their classic 1957 article, Ralph G. Nichols and
Leonard A. Stevens explain why listening is a key component in business
communication and why so many people struggle with it. In this excerpt,
they describe how emotions can affect what we hear—and provide two ways
to train yourself to get more out of your conversations.</p>
<p>In different degrees and in many different ways, listening ability is
affected by our emotions.1 Figuratively we reach up and mentally turn
off what we do not want to hear. Or, on the other hand, when someone
says what we especially want to hear, we open our ears wide, accepting
everything—truths, half-truths, or fiction. We might say, then, that our
emotions act as aural filters. At times they in effect cause deafness,
and at other times they make listening altogether too easy. If we hear
something that opposes our most deeply rooted prejudices, notions,
convictions, mores, or complexes, our brains may become overstimulated,
and not in a direction that leads to good listening. We mentally plan a
rebuttal to what we hear, formulate a question designed to embarrass the
talker, or perhaps simply turn to thoughts that support our own feelings
on the subject at hand. For example:</p>
<p>The firm’s accountant goes to the general manager and says: “I have
just heard from the Bureau of Internal Revenue, and . . .” The general
manager suddenly breathes harder as he thinks, “That blasted bureau!
Can’t they leave me alone? Every year the government milks my profits to
a point where . . .” Red in the face, he whirls and stares out the
window. The label “Bureau of Internal Revenue” cuts loose emotions that
stop the general manager’s listening.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the accountant may go on to say that here is a
chance to save ,000 this year if the general manager will take a few
simple steps. The fuming general manager may hear this—if the accountant
presses hard enough—but the chances are he will fail to comprehend
it.</p>
<p>When emotions make listening too easy, it usually results from
hearing something that supports the deeply rooted inner feelings that we
hold. When we hear such support, our mental barriers are dropped and
everything is welcomed. We ask few questions about what we hear; our
critical faculties are put out of commission by our emotions. Thinking
drops to a minimum because we are hearing thoughts that we have harbored
for years in support of our inner feelings. It is good to hear someone
else think those thoughts, so we lazily enjoy the whole experience.</p>
<p>What can we do about these emotional filters? The solution is not
easy in practice, although it can be summed up in this simple
admonition: Hear the man out. Following are two pointers that often help
in training people to do this:</p>
<p>Withhold evaluation. This is one of the most important principles of
learning, especially learning through the ear. It requires self-control,
sometimes more than many of us can muster, but with persistent practice
it can be turned into a valuable habit. While listening, the main object
is to comprehend each point made by the talker. Judgments and decisions
should be reserved until after the talker has finished. At that time,
and only then, review his main ideas and assess them.</p>
<p>Hunt for negative evidence. When we listen, it is human to go on a
militant search for evidence that proves us right in what we believe.
Seldom do we make a search for evidence to prove ourselves wrong. The
latter type of effort is not easy, for behind its application must lie a
generous spirit and real breadth of outlook. However, an important part
of listening comprehension is found in the search for negative evidence
in what we hear. If we make up our minds to seek out the ideas that
might prove us wrong, as well as those that might prove us right, we are
less in danger of missing what people have to say.</p>
<p>RALPH G. NICHOLS was nationally known for his many articles and
lectures on communication problems. He served as the president of the
National Society for the Study of Communication. LEONARD A. STEVENS is a
freelance writer and a consultant on oral presentation to a number of
leading companies and also is affiliated with Management Development
Associates of New York. Nichols and Stevens coauthored the book Are You
Listening?</p>
