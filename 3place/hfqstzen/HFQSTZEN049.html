<h4 id="to-resolve-a-conflict-first-decide-is-it-hot-or-cold">1 To
Resolve a Conflict, First Decide: Is It Hot or Cold?</h4>
<p>By Mark Gerzon</p>
<p>As a leader, you’re going to face conflict. It comes with the
territory. But before you try to deal with a conflict, you first need to
stop and ask yourself the following question:</p>
<p>Is it hot or cold?</p>
<p>To help you answer this vital question, consider these two
definitions:</p>
<p>Hot conflict is when one or more parties are highly emotional and
doing one or more of the following: speaking loudly or shouting; being
physically aggressive, wild, or threatening; using language that is
incendiary; appearing out of control and potentially explosive.</p>
<p>Cold conflict is when one or more parties seem to be suppressing
emotions or are appearing “unemotional” and are doing one or more of the
following: muttering under their breath or pursing their lips; being
physically withdrawn or controlled; turning away or otherwise deflecting
contact; remaining silent or speaking in a tone that is passively
aggressive; appearing shut down or somehow frozen.</p>
<p>Neither of these types of conflict is constructive. Conflicts that
are warm—that is, already open for discussion but not inflamed with
intense hostility—are far more likely to be productive. So if you’re
dealing with cold conflict, you need skills to “warm it up.” If you’re
dealing with hot conflict, you need skills to “cool it down.”</p>
<p>Conflict resolution, like cooking, works best at the optimal
temperature. If too hot, your conflict may explode, burning your deal or
causing your relationship to flame out in anger or overt hostility. Too
cold, and your deal may be frozen, not moving forward at all, or the
relationship may become icy with unexpressed emotions and withheld
concerns. As a leader, you want to bring conflict into a temperature
zone where it can become useful and productive.</p>
<p>In the 20 years that I’ve been dealing with conflict professionally,
I’ve operated in both hot and cold settings. In my work with companies,
educational institutions, and faith-based organizations in the United
States, I have generally found cold conflict. However, in my work with
politicians both in the United States and in conflict zones around the
world as a United Nations mediator, I have often dealt with hot
conflict. And I’ve learned firsthand that understanding this hot/cold
distinction is a crucial first step before you start trying to act like
a mediator in any organization. Once you’ve made a definitive hot/cold
diagnosis, you’ll need to understand what some of the dynamics behind
each situation might be.</p>
<p>If the conflict is hot. You don’t want to bring participants in a hot
conflict together in the same room without setting ground rules that are
strong enough to contain the potentially explosive energy. For example,
if you are dealing with a conflict between two board members who have
already attacked each other verbally, you would set clear ground
rules—and obtain agreement to them—at the outset of your board meeting
before anyone has a chance to speak.</p>
<p>Try this approach: Have everyone sit in a circle, and then ask each
person to speak in turn with strict limits (three minutes each, for
example). Pick a question for everyone to answer that requires each
person to speak about themselves and their own feelings. For example,
when I worked with members of the US House of Representatives, the
question that opened the retreats I designed was, “How does the way the
House deals with its differences affect you and your family personally?”
The result of this sort of question-and-answer session would be an
opening round of conversation that avoided personal attacks, allowed
everyone to speak, and ideally deepened trust before people entered
more-difficult territory.</p>
<p>If the conflict is cold. In a cold conflict situation, you can
usually go ahead and bring the participants or stakeholders in the
conflict together and engage them in constructive communication. That
dialogue, if properly facilitated, should “warm up” the conflict enough
so that it can begin to thaw out and start the process of
transformation. But you will still need to be vigilant and prepared.
Conflict is often cold precisely because so much feeling is being
repressed. So you’ll need to know how to warm things up without the
temperature unexpectedly skyrocketing.</p>
<p>To do this, use debate and dialogue. If a group is avoiding tackling
a tough issue, frame the differences as a debate. Then form two (or, if
necessary, more) teams, and hold an actual debate. This will accentuate
the differences and inspire the group to recognize the conflict that is
under the surface.</p>
<p>For both hot and cold conflict. Whether the conflict is hot or cold,
the goal is not compromise but rather bridging the divide and innovating
new options or solutions. Bridging means creating stronger ties and
deeper trust between the former antagonists. Innovating—which is
distinct from compromising—means that some new resolution or possibility
has emerged.</p>
<p>Conflict resolution isn’t something you learn overnight. It takes
time, practice, and reflection. If you find yourself in the middle of a
conflict and you haven’t yet developed the skills to address it,
consider bringing in a third party or a professional mediator to help.
With that said, if you’re reading this in the middle of an intense,
immediate conflict that requires urgent action, keep the following
advice in mind:</p>
<p>Make time your ally. Don’t rush to act. Unless you’re in danger, take
stock of your options. Otherwise you might say or do something you
regret.</p>
<p>Determine your goal, and focus on it. Don’t get distracted; stick to
what matters.</p>
<p>Avoid name-calling and finger-pointing. Focus on the problem, not the
people.</p>
<p>Beware of self-righteousness. Keep an open mind; you may find that
you can learn something of value.</p>
<p>Listen to everything, but respond selectively. You don’t have to
address every point—just the ones that make a difference.</p>
<p>Take stock before you take sides. Don’t speak—or take any other
action—until you’ve really heard the other person out. Don’t leap to
conclusions before you have a firm grasp of the situation at hand.</p>
<p>Consider calling in a third party. Someone who is not involved in the
conflict may be able to provide vital perspective for both parties.</p>
<p>Allow your adversary to know you. Letting down your guard and letting
the other person in may help them understand your point of view.</p>
<p>Check the temperature gauge. If the conflict is still too hot, don’t
try to resolve it right away. Agree to come back when things have
cooled.</p>
<p>Observe the golden rule. Do unto others as you would have them do
unto you. Be polite. Be compassionate. It may inspire your adversary to
do the same.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that showing your ability to navigate conflict is one of
the primary ways that you reveal your character as a leader. The best
time to learn is when conflict is neither too hot nor too cold. By
learning to control the temperature, you make it much more likely that
you’ll be well positioned to deal creatively with the next conflict
that’s inevitably coming your way.</p>
