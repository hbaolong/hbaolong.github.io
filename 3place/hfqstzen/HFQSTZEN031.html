<h4 id="the-happiness-backlash">7 The Happiness Backlash</h4>
<p>By Alison Beard</p>
<p>Nothing depresses me more than reading about happiness. Why? Because
there’s entirely too much advice out there about how to achieve it. As
Frédéric Lenoir points out in Happiness: A Philosopher’s Guide (recently
translated from its original French), great thinkers have been
discussing this topic for more than 2,000 years. But opinions on it
still differ. Just scan the 14,700 titles listed in the “happiness”
subgenre of self-help books on Amazon, or watch the 55 TED talks tagged
in the same category. What makes us happy? Health, money, social
connection, purpose, “flow,” generosity, gratitude, inner peace,
positive thinking . . . research shows that any (or all?) of the above
answers are correct. Social scientists tell us that even the simplest of
tricks—counting our blessings, meditating for 10 minutes a day, forcing
smiles—can push us into a happier state of mind.</p>
<p>And yet for me and many others, happiness remains elusive. Of course,
I sometimes feel joyful and content—reading a bedtime story to my kids,
interviewing someone I greatly admire, finishing a tough piece of
writing. But despite having good health, supportive family and friends,
and a stimulating and flexible job, I’m often awash in negative
emotions: worry, frustration, anger, disappointment, guilt, envy,
regret. My default state is dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The huge and growing body of happiness literature promises to lift me
out of these feelings. But the effect is more like kicking me when I’m
down. I know I should be happy. I know I have every reason to be and
that I’m better off than most. I know that happier people are more
successful. I know that just a few mental exercises might help me.
Still, when I’m in a bad mood, it’s hard to break out of it. And—I’ll
admit—a small part of me regards my nonbliss not as unproductive
negativity but as highly productive realism. I can’t imagine being happy
all the time; indeed, I’m highly suspicious of anyone who claims to
be.</p>
<p>I agreed to write this essay because over the past several years I’ve
sensed a swell of support for this point of view. Barbara Ehrenreich’s
2009 book Bright-Sided, about the “relentless promotion” and undermining
effects of positive thinking, was followed last year by Rethinking
Positive Thinking, by the NYU psychology professor Gabriele Oettingen,
and The Upside of Your Dark Side, by two experts in positive psychology,
Todd Kashdan and Robert Biswas-Diener. This year brought a terrific
Psychology Today article by Matthew Hutson titled “Beyond Happiness: The
Upside of Feeling Down”; The Upside of Stress, by Stanford’s Kelly
McGonigal; Beyond Happiness, by the British historian and commentator
Anthony Seldon; and The Happiness Industry: How the Government and Big
Business Sold Us Well-Being, by another Brit, the Goldsmiths lecturer in
politics William Davies.</p>
<p>Are we finally seeing a backlash against happiness? Sort of. Most of
these recent releases rail against our modern obsession with feeling
happy and thinking positively. Oettingen explains the importance of
damping sunny fantasies with sober analysis of the obstacles in one’s
way. Kashdan and Biswas-Diener’s book and Hutson’s article detail the
benefits we derive from all the negative emotions I cited earlier; taken
together, those feelings spur us to better our circumstances and
ourselves. (The Harvard psychologist Susan David, a coauthor of the HBR
article “Emotional Agility,” also writes thoughtfully on this
topic.)</p>
<p>McGonigal shows how viewing one unhappy condition—stress—in a kinder
light can turn it into something that improves rather than hurts our
health. Those who accept feeling stressed as the body’s natural response
to a challenge are more resilient and live longer than those who try to
fight it.</p>
<p>Seldon describes his own progression from pleasure seeking to
more-meaningful endeavors that bring him (and should bring us) joy.
Sadly, he trivializes his advice by alphabetizing it: Accepting oneself;
Belonging to a group; having good Character, Discipline, Empathy, Focus,
Generosity, and Health; using Inquiry; embarking on an inner Journey;
accepting Karma; and embracing both Liturgy and Meditation. (One wonders
what he’ll use for X and Z in the next book.)</p>
<p>Davies comes at the issue from a different angle. He’s fed up with
organizational attempts to tap into what is essentially a “grey mushy
process inside our brains.” In his view, there’s something sinister
about the way advertisers, HR managers, governments, and pharmaceutical
companies are measuring, manipulating, and ultimately making money from
our insatiable desire to be happier.</p>
<p>But none of these authors is arguing against individuals’ aspiring to
have a generally happy life. We call that the pursuit of “happiness,”
but what we really mean is “long-term fulfillment.” Martin Seligman, the
father of positive psychology, calls it “flourishing” and said years ago
that positive emotion (that is, feeling happy) is only one element of
it, along with engagement, relationships, meaning, and achievement. In
the parlance Arianna Huffington uses in her recent book, it’s
“thriving,” and Lenoir, whose history of happiness philosophy is
probably the most enlightening and entertaining of the bunch, describes
it as simply “love of life.” Who can argue against any of those
things?</p>
<p>Where most of the happiness gurus go wrong is insisting that daily if
not constant happiness is a means to long-term fulfillment. For some
glass-half-full optimists, that may be true. They can “stumble on
happiness” the way the field’s most prominent researcher, Dan Gilbert,
suggests; or gain “the happiness advantage” that the
professor-turned-consultant Shawn Achor talks about; or “broadcast
happiness,” as Michelle Gielan, Achor’s wife and partner at the firm
GoodThink, recommends in her new book. As I said, it apparently takes
just a few simple tricks.</p>
<p>But for the rest of us, that much cheer feels forced, so it’s
unlikely to help us mold meaningful relationships or craft the perfect
career. It certainly can’t be drawn out of us by employers or other
external forces. We pursue fulfillment in different ways, without
reading self-help books. And I suspect that in the long run we’ll be
OK—perhaps even happy.</p>
