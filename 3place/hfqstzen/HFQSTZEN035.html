<h4 id="practice-tough-empathy">4 Practice Tough Empathy</h4>
<p>By Rob Goffee and Gareth Jones</p>
<p>There’s altogether too much hype nowadays about the idea that leaders
must show concern for their teams. There’s nothing worse than seeing a
manager return from the latest interpersonal-skills training program
with “concern” for others. Real leaders don’t need a training program to
convince their employees that they care. Real leaders empathize fiercely
with the people they lead. They also care intensely about the work their
employees do.</p>
<p>Consider Alain Levy, the former CEO of Polygram. Although he often
comes across as a rather aloof intellectual, Levy is well able to close
the distance between himself and his followers. On one occasion, he
helped some junior record executives in Australia choose singles off
albums. Picking singles is a critical task in the music business: The
selection of a song can make or break the album. Levy sat down with the
young people and took on the work with passion. “You bloody idiots,” he
added his voice to the melee, “you don’t know what the hell you’re
talking about; we always have a dance track first!” Within 24 hours, the
story spread throughout the company; it was the best PR Levy ever got.
“Levy really knows how to pick singles,” people said. In fact, he knew
how to identify with the work, and he knew how to enter his followers’
world—one where strong, colorful language is the norm—to show them that
he cared.</p>
<p>Clearly, as the above example illustrates, we do not believe that the
empathy of inspirational leaders is the soft kind described in so much
of the management literature. On the contrary, we feel that real leaders
manage through a unique approach we call tough empathy. Tough empathy
means giving people what they need, not what they want. Organizations
like the Marine Corps and consulting firms specialize in tough empathy.
Recruits are pushed to be the best that they can be; “grow or go” is the
motto. Chris Satterwaite, the CEO of Bell Pottinger Communications and a
former chief executive of several ad agencies, understands what tough
empathy is all about. He adeptly handles the challenges of managing
creative people while making tough decisions. “If I have to, I can be
ruthless,” he says. “But while they’re with me, I promise my people that
they’ll learn.”</p>
<p>At its best, tough empathy balances respect for the individual and
for the task at hand. Attending to both, however, isn’t easy, especially
when the business is in survival mode. At such times, caring leaders
have to give selflessly to the people around them and know when to pull
back. Consider a situation at Unilever at a time when it was developing
Persil Power, a detergent that eventually had to be removed from the
market because it destroyed clothes that were laundered in it. Even
though the product was showing early signs of trouble, CEO Niall
FitzGerald stood by his troops. “That was the popular place to be, but I
should not have been there,” he says now. “I should have stood back,
cool and detached, looked at the whole field, watched out for the
customer.” But caring with detachment is not easy, especially since,
when done right, tough empathy is harder on you than on your employees.
“Some theories of leadership make caring look effortless. It isn’t,”
says Paulanne Mancuso, president and CEO of Calvin Klein Cosmetics. “You
have to do things you don’t want to do, and that’s hard.” It’s tough to
be tough.</p>
<p>Tough empathy also has the benefit of impelling leaders to take
risks. When Greg Dyke took over at the BBC, his commercial competitors
were able to spend substantially more on programs than the BBC could.
Dyke quickly realized that in order to thrive in a digital world, the
BBC needed to increase its expenditures. He explained this openly and
directly to the staff. Once he had secured their buy-in, he began
thoroughly restructuring the organization. Although many employees were
let go, he was able to maintain people’s commitment. Dyke attributed his
success to his tough empathy with employees: “Once you have the people
with you, you can make the difficult decisions that need to be
made.”</p>
<p>One final point about tough empathy: Those more apt to use it are
people who really care about something. And when people care deeply
about something—anything—they’re more likely to show their true selves.
They will not only communicate authenticity, which is the precondition
for leadership, but they will show that they are doing more than just
playing a role. People do not commit to executives who merely live up to
the obligations of their jobs. They want more. They want someone who
cares passionately about the people and the work—just as they do.</p>
