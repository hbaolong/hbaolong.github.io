Why Compassion Is a Better Managerial Tactic Than Toughness</h4>
<p>By Emma Seppala</p>
<p>Stanford University neurosurgeon James Doty tells the story of
performing surgery on a little boy’s brain tumor. In the middle of the
procedure, the resident who is assisting him gets distracted and
accidentally pierces a vein. With blood shedding everywhere, Doty is no
longer able to see the delicate brain area he is working on. The boy’s
life is at stake. Doty is left with no other choice than to blindly
reach into the affected area in the hopes of locating and clamping the
vein. Fortunately, he is successful.</p>
<p>Most of us are not brain surgeons, but we certainly are all
confronted with situations in which an employee makes a grave mistake,
potentially ruining a critical project. The question is: How should we
react when an employee is not performing well or makes a mistake?</p>
<p>Frustration is of course the natural response—and one we all can
identify with. Especially if the mistake hurts an important project or
reflects badly on us.</p>
<p>The traditional approach is to reprimand the employee in some way.
The hope is that some form of punishment will be beneficial: It will
teach the employee a lesson. Expressing our frustration also may relieve
us of the stress and anger caused by the mistake. Finally, it may help
the rest of the team stay on their toes to avoid making future
errors.</p>
<p>Some managers, however, choose a different response when confronted
by an underperforming employee: compassion and curiosity. Not that a
part of them isn’t frustrated or exasperated—maybe they still worry
about how their employee’s mistakes will reflect back on them—but they
are somehow able to suspend judgment and may even be able to use the
moment to do a bit of coaching.</p>
<p>What does research say is best? The more compassionate response will
get you more powerful results.</p>
<p>First, compassion and curiosity increase employee loyalty and trust.
Research has shown that feelings of warmth and positive relationships at
work have a greater say over an employee’s loyalty than the size of his
or her paycheck.1 In particular, a study by Jonathan Haidt of New York
University shows that the more employees look up to their leaders and
are moved by their compassion or kindness (a state he terms
“elevation”), the more loyal they become to him or her.2 So if you are
more compassionate to your employee, not only will he or she be more
loyal to you, but anyone else who has witnessed your behavior may also
experience elevation and feel more devoted to you.</p>
<p>Conversely, responding with anger or frustration erodes loyalty. As
Adam Grant, professor at the Wharton Business School and author of Give
and Take, points out that, because of the law of reciprocity, if you
embarrass or blame an employee too harshly, your reaction may end up
coming around to haunt you. “Next time you need to rely on that
employee, you may have lost some of the loyalty that was there before,”
he told me.</p>
<p>We are especially sensitive to signs of trustworthiness in our
leaders, and compassion increases our willingness to trust.3 Simply put,
our brains respond more positively to bosses who have shown us empathy,
as neuroimaging research confirms.4 Employee trust in turn improves
performance.5</p>
<p>Doty, who is also director of Stanford University’s Center for
Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, recalls his first
experience in the operating room. He was so nervous that he perspired
profusely. Soon enough, a drop of sweat fell into the operation site and
contaminated it. The operation was a simple one, and the patients’ life
was in no way at stake. As for the operation site, it could have been
easily irrigated. However, the operating surgeon—one of the biggest
names in surgery at the time—was so angry that he kicked Doty out of the
OR. Doty recalls returning home and crying tears of devastation.</p>
<p>Tellingly, Doty explains in an interview how, if the surgeon had
acted differently, he would have gained Doty’s undying loyalty. “If the
surgeon, instead of raging, had said something like: ‘Listen young man,
look what just happened—you contaminated the field. I know you’re
nervous. You can’t be nervous if you want to be a surgeon. Why don’t you
go outside and take a few minutes to collect yourself. Readjust your cap
in such a way that the sweat doesn’t pour down your face. Then come back
and I’ll show you something.’ Well, then he would have been my hero
forever.”</p>
<p>Not only does an angry response erode loyalty and trust, it also
inhibits creativity by jacking up the employee’s stress level. As Doty
explains, “Creating an environment where there is fear, anxiety, and
lack of trust makes people shut down. If people have fear and anxiety,
we know from neuroscience that their threat response is engaged, and
their cognitive control is impacted. As a consequence, their
productivity and creativity diminish.” For instance, brain-imaging
studies show that when we feel safe, our brain’s stress response is
lower.6</p>
<p>Grant also agrees that “when you respond in a frustrated, furious
manner, the employee becomes less likely to take risks in the future
because he or she worries about the negative consequences of making
mistakes. In other words, you kill the culture of experimentation that
is critical to learning and innovation.” Grant refers to research by
Fiona Lee at the University of Michigan that shows that promoting a
culture of safety—rather than of fear of negative consequences—helps
encourage the spirit of experimentation that is so critical for
creativity.7</p>
<p>There is, of course, a reason we feel anger. Research shows that
feelings of anger can have beneficial results. For example, they can
give us the energy to stand up against injustice.8 Moreover, they make
us appear more powerful.9 However, when as a leader you express negative
emotions like anger, your employees actually view you as less
effective.10 Conversely, being likable and projecting warmth—not
toughness—gives leaders a distinct advantage, as Amy Cuddy of Harvard
Business School has shown.11</p>
<p>So how can you respond with more compassion the next time an employee
makes a serious mistake?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Take a moment. Doty explains that the first thing to do is to get a
handle on your own emotions—anger, frustration, or whatever the case may
be. “You have to take a step back and control your own emotional
response, because if you act out of emotional engagement, you are not
thoughtful about your approach to the problem. By stepping back and
taking a period of time to reflect, you enter a mental state that allows
for a more thoughtful, reasonable, and discerned response.” Practicing
meditation can help improve your self-awareness and emotional
control.12</li>
</ol>
<p>You don’t want to operate from a place where you are just pretending
not to be angry. Research shows that this kind of pretense actually ends
up raising heart rates for both you and your employee.13 Instead, take
some time to cool off so you can see the situation with more
detachment.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Put yourself in your employee’s shoes. Taking a step back will help
give you the ability to empathize with your employee. Why was Doty, in
the near-tragic moment in the operating room, able to respond
productively rather than with anger? As a consequence of recalling his
own first experience in the OR, he could identify and empathize with the
resident. This allowed him to curb his frustration, avoid degrading the
already horrified resident, and maintain the presence of mind to save a
little boy’s life.</li>
</ol>
<p>The ability to perspective-take is a valuable one. Studies have shown
that it helps you see aspects of the situation you may not have noticed
and leads to better results in interactions and negotiations.14 And
because positions of power tend to lower our natural inclination for
empathy, it is particularly important that managers have the
self-awareness to make sure they practice seeing situations from their
employee’s perspective.15</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Forgive. Empathy, of course, helps you forgive. Forgiveness not only
strengthens your relationship with your employee by promoting loyalty,
it turns out that it is also good for you. Whereas carrying a grudge is
bad for your heart (blood pressure and heart rate both go up),
forgiveness lowers both your blood pressure and that of the person
you’re forgiving.16 Other studies show that forgiveness makes you
happier and more satisfied with life, significantly reducing stress and
negative emotions.17</li>
</ol>
<p>When trust, loyalty, and creativity are high and stress is low,
employees are happier and more productive, and turnover is lower.18
Positive interactions even make employees healthier and require fewer
sick days.19 Other studies have shown how compassionate management leads
to improvements in customer service and client outcomes and
satisfaction.20</p>
<p>Doty told me he’s never thrown anyone out of his OR. “It’s not that I
let them off the hook, but by choosing a compassionate response when
they know they have made a mistake, they are not destroyed, they have
learned a lesson, and they want to improve for you because you’ve been
kind to them.”</p>
