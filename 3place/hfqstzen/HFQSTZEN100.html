<h4 id="to-improve-your-focus-notice-how-you-lose-it">3 To Improve Your
Focus, Notice How You Lose It</h4>
<p>By Michael Lipson</p>
<p>We’ve all been there: You try to focus on a task, and soon you’re
looking out the window, wondering about dinner, analyzing your golf
game, fantasizing about your lover. How did your mind end up in Cancún
when you were supposed to be thinking about first-quarter strategy?</p>
<p>The normal act of concentration or attention is a mess, but it’s a
mess with a specific structure. To learn to sharpen your focus, you can
start by understanding this “structure of distraction”—how, exactly,
your concentration strays in the first place.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years working as a clinical psychologist, I have led
workshops and meditation groups that have taught people from all walks
of life to see the structure of their own distraction. In my work with
clinicians in end-of-life care, understanding this structure has helped
them distinguish between the needs of dying patients and their own
emotional responses. This same skill has helped families to drop
resentments and choose togetherness. It has helped business leaders
clarify their strategic goals and develop the courage both to initiate
and to end internal and external relationships. It has even helped golf
players keep their mind on their swing and their eye on the ball.</p>
<p>What follows is my reformulation of wisdom that has been around since
people first noticed they had minds—and simultaneously noticed that the
mind could be distracted from its intentional focus. It didn’t start
with the cell phone, as scholar and innovator Cathy Davidson points
out.1 In Greek mythology, Hercules distracts Atlas and tricks him into
losing his focus and his freedom. Homer has Circe distract Odysseus from
his journey—probably not the first or last sexual distraction. Plato’s
Socrates explains in his last dialogue that the mind is normally in
shreds, and the purpose of philosophy is to “gather” and concentrate the
mind in spite of its centrifugal forces. Shakespeare points to a
distracted mind, for example, in Claudius’s monologue in Hamlet.</p>
<p>Like Plato, most writers not only complain about distraction but
point implicitly or explicitly to ways to address its downsides. In the
meditative traditions, everyone from Gautama Buddha to mindfulness
expert Andy Puddicombe of Headspace has said that the prime way to deal
with distraction is first to be okay with it, which means noticing it.2
You notice the distraction, and bring your mind back.</p>
<p>The approach I use summarizes and condenses the wisdom from these
disparate traditions. You begin by simply noticing that there are four
phases of attention and distraction that happen every time you try to
focus:</p>
<p>First, you choose a focus. It might be anything, from any sphere of
life. At work, it’s supposed to be some aspect of work—let’s say, whom
to include in an important meeting.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, your attention wanders. This isn’t what you plan to
do. It just happens. (If it were a plan, it would be another focus, not
a wandering.)</p>
<p>Sooner or later, you wake up to the fact that your mind has wandered.
You notice the distraction. You realize how far you are from the thing
you first wanted to focus on. Again, you can’t exactly plan or choose
this.</p>
<p>Having woken up, you may choose to return to the original theme. For
example, whom to invite to that meeting. Then again, you may choose to
give up and do something else. It’s up to you; it’s a choice.</p>
<p>If you do return to the original theme at step 4, the whole thing
tends to begin again. Sooner or later, your mind wanders.</p>
<p>Reviewing these four steps, you’ll notice that steps 1 and 4 are
conscious choices. Steps 2 and 3 are unconscious—they just happen. The
unconscious force at work in the second step, when your mind “just
wanders,” seems to be hostile to the project of focusing; the force
operating in the third step, when you notice your distraction, is not
exactly friendly to your focus, but it is friendly to your freedom. It
wakes you up to the fact of having wandered from your theme, then leaves
it up to you to return to that original focus or not.</p>
<p>Just by noticing these stages over and over as they play out in real
time, you’ll find that the pattern changes. At first you may simply note
that these four stages occur. With repeated attention to the process,
you will tend to stay with the original focus longer before distraction
sets in. You will wander less far away from the theme, and for a shorter
length of time, before waking up. And having woken up from a
distraction, you will choose more often to return to the original theme
rather than give up and stretch your legs.</p>
<p>Here’s how to get started. Pick a theme, any theme: something you
want to focus on that would potentially help your business. It could be
a personnel decision, it could be a strategic decision, it could be a
management issue. That’s step 1, your focus. Think about it as clearly
and creatively as you can. Soon, your attention will wander. But the
very act of noticing the distraction, and the structure of distraction,
will gradually strengthen your ability to stay focused and head off
distraction in the first place.</p>
