<h4 id="find-the-coaching-in-criticism">4 Find the Coaching in
Criticism</h4>
<p>By Sheila Heen and Douglas Stone</p>
<p>Feedback is crucial. That’s obvious: It improves performance,
develops talent, aligns expectations, solves problems, guides promotion
and pay, and boosts the bottom line.</p>
<p>But it’s equally obvious that in many organizations, feedback doesn’t
work. A glance at the stats tells the story: Only 36% of managers
complete appraisals thoroughly and on time. In one recent survey, 55% of
employees said their most recent performance review had been unfair or
inaccurate, and one in four said they dread such evaluations more than
anything else in their working lives. When senior HR executives were
asked about their biggest performance management challenge, 63% cited
managers’ inability or unwillingness to have difficult feedback
discussions. Coaching and mentoring? Uneven at best.</p>
<p>Most companies try to address these problems by training leaders to
give feedback more effectively and more often. That’s fine as far as it
goes; everyone benefits when managers are better communicators. But
improving the skills of the feedback giver won’t accomplish much if the
receiver isn’t able to absorb what is said. It is the receiver who
controls whether feedback is let in or kept out, who has to make sense
of what he or she is hearing, and who decides whether or not to change.
People need to stop treating feedback only as something that must be
pushed and instead improve their ability to pull.</p>
<p>For the past 20 years we’ve coached executives on difficult
conversations, and we’ve found that almost everyone, from new hires to
C-suite veterans, struggles with receiving feedback. A critical
performance review, a well-intended suggestion, or an oblique comment
that may or may not even be feedback (“Well, your presentation was
certainly interesting”) can spark an emotional reaction, inject tension
into the relationship, and bring communication to a halt. But there’s
good news, too: The skills needed to receive feedback well are distinct
and learnable. They include being able to identify and manage the
emotions triggered by the feedback and extract value from criticism even
when it’s poorly delivered.</p>
<p>Why feedback doesn’t register</p>
<p>What makes receiving feedback so hard? The process strikes at the
tension between two core human needs—the need to learn and grow, and the
need to be accepted just the way you are. As a result, even a seemingly
benign suggestion can leave you feeling angry, anxious, badly treated,
or profoundly threatened. A hedge such as “Don’t take this personally”
does nothing to soften the blow.</p>
<p>Getting better at receiving feedback starts with understanding and
managing those feelings. You might think there are a thousand ways in
which feedback can push your buttons, but in fact there are only
three.</p>
<p>Truth triggers are set off by the content of the feedback. When
assessments or advice seem off base, unhelpful, or simply untrue, you
feel indignant, wronged, and exasperated.</p>
<p>Relationship triggers are tripped by the person providing the
feedback. Exchanges are often colored by what you believe about the
giver (He’s got no credibility on this topic!) and how you feel about
your previous interactions (After all I’ve done for you, I get this
petty criticism?). So you might reject coaching that you would accept on
its merits if it came from someone else.</p>
<p>Identity triggers are all about your relationship with yourself.
Whether the feedback is right or wrong, wise or witless, it can be
devastating if it causes your sense of who you are to come undone. In
such moments you’ll struggle with feeling overwhelmed, defensive, or off
balance.</p>
<p>All these responses are natural and reasonable; in some cases they
are unavoidable. The solution isn’t to pretend you don’t have them. It’s
to recognize what’s happening and learn how to derive benefit from
feedback even when it sets off one or more of your triggers.</p>
<p>Six steps to becoming a better receiver</p>
<p>Taking feedback well is a process of sorting and filtering. You need
to understand the other person’s point of view, try on ideas that may at
first seem a poor fit, and experiment with different ways of doing
things. You also need to discard or shelve critiques that are genuinely
misdirected or are not helpful right away. But it’s nearly impossible to
do any of those things from inside a triggered response. Instead of
ushering you into a nuanced conversation that will help you learn, your
triggers prime you to reject, counterattack, or withdraw.</p>
<p>The six steps below will keep you from throwing valuable feedback
onto the discard pile or—just as damaging—accepting and acting on
comments that you would be better off disregarding. They are presented
as advice to the receiver. But, of course, understanding the challenges
of receiving feedback helps the giver be more effective, too.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Know your tendencies</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ve been getting feedback all your life, so there are no doubt
patterns in how you respond. Do you defend yourself on the facts (“This
is plain wrong”), argue about the method of delivery (“You’re really
doing this by email?”), or strike back (“You, of all people?”)? Do you
smile on the outside but seethe on the inside? Do you get teary or
filled with righteous indignation? And what role does the passage of
time play? Do you tend to reject feedback in the moment and then step
back and consider it over time? Do you accept it all immediately but
later decide it’s not valid? Do you agree with it intellectually but
have trouble changing your behavior?</p>
<p>When Michael, an advertising executive, hears his boss make an
offhand joke about his lack of professionalism, it hits him like a
sledgehammer. “I’m flooded with shame,” he told us, “and all my failings
rush to mind, as if I’m Googling ‘things wrong with me’ and getting 1.2
million hits, with sponsored ads from my father and my ex. In this state
it’s hard to see the feedback at ‘actual size.’” But now that Michael
understands his standard operating procedure, he’s able to make better
choices about where to go from there: “I can reassure myself that I’m
exaggerating, and usually after I sleep on it, I’m in a better place to
figure out whether there’s something I can learn.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Disentangle the “what” from the “who”</li>
</ol>
<p>If the feedback is on target and the advice is wise, it shouldn’t
matter who delivers it. But it does. When a relationship trigger is
activated, entwining the content of comments with your feelings about
the giver (or about how, when, or where she delivered the comments),
learning is short-circuited. To keep that from happening, you have to
work to separate the message from the messenger, and then consider
both.</p>
<p>Janet, a chemist and a team leader at a pharmaceutical company,
received glowing comments from her peers and superiors during her
360-degree review but was surprised by the negative feedback she got
from her direct reports. She immediately concluded that the problem was
theirs: “I have high standards, and some of them can’t handle that,” she
remembers thinking. “They aren’t used to someone holding their feet to
the fire.” In this way, she changed the subject from her management
style to her subordinates’ competence, preventing her from learning
something important about the impact she had on others.</p>
<p>Eventually the penny dropped, Janet says. “I came to see that whether
it was their performance problem or my leadership problem, those were
not mutually exclusive issues, and both were worth solving.” She was
able to disentangle the issues and talk to her team about both. Wisely,
she began the conversation with their feedback to her, asking, “What am
I doing that’s making things tough? What would improve the
situation?”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Sort toward coaching</li>
</ol>
<p>Some feedback is evaluative (“Your rating is a 4”); some is coaching
(“Here’s how you can improve”). Everyone needs both. Evaluations tell
you where you stand, what to expect, and what is expected of you.
Coaching allows you to learn and improve and helps you play at a higher
level.</p>
<p>It’s not always easy to distinguish one from the other. When a board
member phoned James to suggest that he start the next quarter’s CFO
presentation with analyst predictions rather than internal projections,
was that intended as a helpful suggestion, or was it a veiled criticism
of his usual approach? When in doubt, people tend to assume the worst
and to put even well-intentioned coaching into the evaluation bin.
Feeling judged is likely to set off your identity triggers, and the
resulting anxiety can drown out the opportunity to learn. So whenever
possible, sort toward coaching. Work to hear feedback as potentially
valuable advice from a fresh perspective rather than as an indictment of
how you’ve done things in the past. When James took that approach, “the
suggestion became less emotionally loaded,” he says. “I decided to hear
it as simply an indication of how that board member might more easily
digest quarterly information.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Unpack the feedback</li>
</ol>
<p>Often it’s not immediately clear whether feedback is valid and
useful. So before you accept or reject it, do some analysis to better
understand it.</p>
<p>Here’s a hypothetical example. Kara, who’s in sales, is told by
Johann, an experienced colleague, that she needs to “be more assertive.”
Her reaction might be to reject his advice (“I think I’m pretty
assertive already”). Or she might acquiesce (“I really do need to step
it up”). But before she decides what to do, she needs to understand what
he really means. Does he think she should speak up more often, or just
with greater conviction? Should she smile more or less? Have the
confidence to admit she doesn’t know something or the confidence to
pretend she does?</p>
<p>Even the simple advice to “be more assertive” comes from a complex
set of observations and judgments that Johann has made while watching
Kara in meetings and with customers. Kara needs to dig into the general
suggestion and find out what in particular prompted it. What did Johann
see her do or fail to do? What did he expect, and what is he worried
about? In other words, where is the feedback coming from?</p>
<p>Kara also needs to know where the feedback is going—exactly what
Johann wants her to do differently and why. After a clarifying
discussion, she might agree that she is less assertive than others on
the sales floor but disagree with the idea that she should change. If
all her sales heroes are quiet, humble, and deeply curious about
customers’ needs, Kara’s view of what it means to be good at sales might
look and sound very different from Johann’s Glengarry Glen Ross
ideal.</p>
<p>When you set aside snap judgments and take time to explore where
feedback is coming from and where it’s going, you can enter into a rich,
informative conversation about perceived best practices—whether you
decide to take the advice or not.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Ask for just one thing</li>
</ol>
<p>Feedback is less likely to set off your emotional triggers if you
request it and direct it. So don’t wait until your annual performance
review. Find opportunities to get bite-size pieces of coaching from a
variety of people throughout the year. Don’t invite criticism with a
big, unfocused question like “Do you have any feedback for me?” Make the
process more manageable by asking a colleague, a boss, or a direct
report, “What’s one thing you see me doing (or failing to do) that holds
me back?” That person may name the first behavior that comes to mind or
the most important one on his or her list. Either way, you’ll get
concrete information and can tease out more specifics at your own
pace.</p>
<p>Roberto, a fund manager at a financial services firm, found his
360-degree review process overwhelming and confusing. “Eighteen pages of
charts and graphs and no ability to have follow-up conversations to
clarify the feedback was frustrating,” he says, adding that it also left
him feeling awkward around his colleagues.</p>
<p>Now Roberto taps two or three people each quarter to ask for one
thing he might work on. “They don’t offer the same things, but over time
I hear themes, and that gives me a good sense of where my growth edge
lies,” he says. “And I have really good conversations—with my boss, with
my team, even with peers where there’s some friction in the
relationship. They’re happy to tell me one thing to change, and often
they’re right. It does help us work more smoothly together.”</p>
<p>Research has shown that those who explicitly seek critical feedback
(that is, who are not just fishing for praise) tend to get higher
performance ratings. Why? Mainly, we think, because someone who’s asking
for coaching is more likely to take what is said to heart and genuinely
improve. But also because when you ask for feedback, you not only find
out how others see you, you also influence how they see you. Soliciting
constructive criticism communicates humility, respect, passion for
excellence, and confidence, all in one go.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Engage in small experiments</li>
</ol>
<p>After you’ve worked to solicit and understand feedback, it may still
be hard to discern which bits of advice will help you and which ones
won’t. We suggest designing small experiments to find out. Even though
you may doubt that a suggestion will be useful, if the downside risk is
small and the upside potential is large, it’s worth a try. James, the
CFO we discussed earlier, decided to take the board member’s advice for
the next presentation and see what happened. Some directors were pleased
with the change, but the shift in format prompted others to offer
suggestions of their own. Today James reverse-engineers his
presentations to meet board members’ current top-of-mind concerns. He
sends out an email a week beforehand asking for any burning questions
and either front-loads his talk with answers to them or signals at the
start that he will get to them later on. “It’s a little more challenging
to prepare for but actually much easier to give,” he says. “I spend less
time fielding unexpected questions, which was the hardest part of the
job.”</p>
<p>That’s an example worth following. When someone gives you advice,
test it out. If it works, great. If it doesn’t, you can try again, tweak
your approach, or decide to end the experiment. Criticism is never easy
to take. Even when you know that it’s essential to your development and
you trust that the person delivering it wants you to succeed, it can
activate psychological triggers. You might feel misjudged, ill-used, and
sometimes threatened to your very core.</p>
<p>Your growth depends on your ability to pull value from criticism in
spite of your natural responses and on your willingness to seek out even
more advice and coaching from bosses, peers, and subordinates. They may
be good or bad at providing it, or they may have little time for it—but
you are the most important factor in your own development. If you’re
determined to learn from whatever feedback you get, no one can stop
you.</p>
