<h4 id="whats-your-power-style">2 What’s Your Power Style?</h4>
<p>By Maggie Craddock</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered if a person’s childhood experiences influence
the way they operate as a professional later in life? Did that boardroom
bully who intimidates others in order to make a point shove people
around on the playground as a kid?</p>
<p>Whether you are trying to get ahead at your existing firm or land a
job in a new organization, it’s helpful to understand that many of your
instincts for giving and taking power stem from ways you were
conditioned in the first system you experienced in life—your family
system. Through my research for my book Power Genes, I discovered that
the building blocks of anyone’s signature power style are rooted in the
ways they have been conditioned to respond emotionally and behaviorally
to the first authority figures they encountered in life, namely, their
caregivers.</p>
<p>To get a sense of how you may be emotionally conditioned to respond
to power in the workplace, reflect for a moment on the predominant way
that your caregivers exerted authority in your family system. Did they
motivate you by considering your feelings, or did they issue orders they
expected to be promptly obeyed? If you were raised by care givers who
asked your opinion when making important family decisions, you probably
react positively to colleagues who take the time to connect with you at
a human level. This type of reaction indicates that the emotional
dimension of your signature power style may be trust-based.</p>
<p>In contrast, people who were raised by caregivers who were either
rigidly authoritarian or highly permissive often find that the emotional
dimension of their power style can be fear-based. They may react
negatively to consensus building on the job and gravitate toward leaders
who operate independently and exude an aura of confidence.</p>
<p>But there is another level of your power style that needs exploring.
The behavioral dimension of your power style stems from the way you
learned to deal with your caregivers as a unit to get what you wanted in
childhood. Did a more informal approach win the day, or did you learn to
operate more formally with them?</p>
<p>If your childhood experience taught you that you could sometimes get
one parent to agree to a request that had been refused by the other, the
behavioral dimension of your signature power style may be predominantly
informal. People with a strong informal dimension to their power style
prefer one-on-one interactions on the job when they are trying to
influence others. For example, even when they know they will need to
present an idea or proposal to a group, they will tend to run their
ideas by key individuals privately before the group meets.</p>
<p>In contrast, clients who report that their caregivers stuck together
when disciplining or rewarding them often exhibit a preference for
dealing with groups to further a professional agenda later in life.
People whose behavioral preferences indicate a formal dimension to their
signature power style prefer to orchestrate an open debate around
contentious issues with a group than negotiate individual agreements in
private.</p>
<p>Comparing the ways my clients learned to adapt to get their needs met
in childhood with the challenges these same clients were facing in their
current jobs unearthed some important trends. For example, Jeff, a
senior executive in the advertising industry, was about to be passed
over for promotion because his tendency to talk over others in meetings
made him appear too anxious to lead a creative team. Jeff had worked
with presentation coaches, but his urgent need to be heard held
sway.</p>
<p>Jeff grew up in the shadow of an older sister who was a champion
figure skater. His parents, who loved and supported him, had been so
preoccupied with his sister’s athletic career that they had
inadvertently left Jeff feeling ignored. Jeff longed to capture and hold
his parents’ attention. This longing drove Jeff to create advertising
campaigns that successfully grabbed the attention of families around the
world. As Jeff began to understand the way that his fear of being
overlooked as a child was undermining the tone he set internally on the
job, he was able to become a more powerful listener and land the
promotion he deserved.</p>
<p>The first step in making change is to identify your own power style.
You can evaluate your signature power style by examining your dominant
emotional triggers and behavioral patterns. Most people find that their
signature power style is a blend of at least two of these four core
power styles:</p>
<p>The Pleaser. Due to outside stressors, Pleasers often didn’t get the
attention they craved from their caretakers early in life. Pleasers
often grow up hungry for validation and are hardwired to take care of
others. Pleasers often wield power by attempting to connect with others
at a personal level.</p>
<p>The Charmer. Charmers were often required to soothe an emotionally
needy parent early in life. As a result, they sometimes have little
respect for formal authority and may manipulate others in order to get
their needs met. The Charmer power style is exemplified by people with
an intensity of focus that both intimidates and seduces others into
compliance.</p>
<p>The Commander. Often, a Commander has grown up in a family system
devoted to sports, religion, the military, or any larger system that
reinforces discipline and a strict code of conduct. Commanders operate
with a results orientation and tend to foster a sense of urgency in
others.</p>
<p>The Inspirer. The family systems that foster Inspirers often value
self-expression over conformity, and the caregivers in such systems are
often willing to make personal sacrifices to achieve excellence in areas
such as artistic expression or scientific inquiry. Inspirers tend to be
innovative thinkers and operate with a consistent commitment to the
greater good.</p>
<p>Each style has inherent strengths and challenges, and each presents
us with important lessons about power in the workplace. Jeff discovered
that his approach to wielding power reflected a blend of the Pleaser and
the Commander, and he was able to use that knowledge to adjust his
habits and behavior.</p>
<p>As you identify your own power style, it’s important to bear in mind
that there are no good or bad power styles, and remember not to make
snap judgments about others or about yourself. Most of us employ more
than one power style, and you may even switch styles depending upon the
situation.</p>
