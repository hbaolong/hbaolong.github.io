<h4 id="how-to-make-work-more-meaningful-for-your-team">8 How to Make
Work More Meaningful for Your Team</h4>
<p>By Lewis Garrad and Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</p>
<p>There is a well-known story about a janitor at NASA who, when asked
by John F. Kennedy what his job was, responded, “I’m helping to put a
man on the moon.” This anecdote is often used to show how even the most
mundane job can be seen as meaningful with the right mindset and under
good leadership.</p>
<p>Today, more and more employees demand much more than a good salary
from their jobs. Money may lure people into particular positions, but
purpose, meaning, and the prospect of interesting and valuable work
determines both their tenure and how hard they will work while they are
on the job. Finding meaning at work has become so important that there
are even public rankings for the most meaningful jobs.1 Although there
are many factors that determining how appealing a position tends to be,
those that contribute to improving other people’s lives (such as those
in health care and social work) are ranked at the top. Interestingly,
meta-analytic studies indicate that there is only a marginal association
between pay and job satisfaction.2 By that reasoning, a lawyer who earns
50,000 a year is no more engaged than a freelance designer who earns
5,000 a year.</p>
<p>Research consistently shows that people who experience meaningful
work report better health, more well-being, and a clearer sense of
teamwork and engagement. They bounce back faster from setbacks and are
more likely to view mistakes as learning opportunities rather than
failures. In other words, people at work who experience their job as
meaningful are more likely to thrive and grow. This is why businesses
with a stronger and clearer sense of purpose tend to perform better
financially. Unsurprisingly, the most successful companies in the world
are also the best places in the world to work.3</p>
<p>Over the past few decades, a great deal of research has shown that
leaders play a significant role in helping employees understand why
their roles matter. Furthermore, the leadership characteristics that
enable these cultures of meaning and purpose to engage employees are a
reflection of a leader’s personality—which has been proven to have a
strong impact on team and organizational performance.4</p>
<p>In particular, research suggests that there are four key personality
characteristics that determine leaders’ ability to make other people’s
jobs more meaningful, namely:</p>
<p>They are curious and inquisitive. Studies show that people tend to
experience work as meaningful when they feel like they are contributing
to creating something new—especially when they feel able to explore,
connect and have an impact.5 Curious leaders help people find meaning at
work by exploring, asking questions, and engaging people in ideas about
the future. In a way, curious leaders help employees find something
meaningful by providing a wider range of possibilities for how work gets
done, as opposed to being very prescriptive and micromanaging people.
Curious leaders also detest monotony and are more likely to get bored,
so they will always be looking for people to come up with new ideas to
make their own experience of work more interesting.</p>
<p>They are challenging and relentless. One of the greatest problems
organizations must solve is the inertia and stagnation that follow, or
even anticipate, success. Research shows that optimistic people who
expect to do well don’t try as hard as people who expect to struggle or
fail.6 Leaders who remain ambitious in the face of both failure and
success, and who push their people to remain dissatisfied with their
accomplishments, instill a deeper sense of purpose in their teams and
organizations. As a result employees feel a sense of progress,
reinvention, and growth, which in turn results in a more meaningful and
positive work experience.</p>
<p>They hire for values and culture fit. Research shows that people only
find something valuable if it aligns with their core needs and motives.
This is why the fit between an individual’s personal values and the
culture of the organization they work in is such an important driver of
their performance. In fact, you are better off not hiring the “best”
people but instead looking for those who are a good fit for your
organization. Values function like an inner compass or lens through
which we assign meaning to the world. Leaders who pay attention to what
each individual values are more likely to hire people who will find it
easier to connect with their colleagues and the wider organization, all
of which help to drive a sense of meaning.7</p>
<p>They are able to trust people. Most individuals hate being
micromanaged. Overpowering and controlling bosses are a serious source
of disempowerment for employees. They drain the value from the work they
do and make employees feel worthless. In stark contrast, leaders who
know how to trust people are more likely to give them room to experiment
and grow. In particular, they help their employees mold their
roles—something researchers call “job crafting.” Employees who customize
their job tend to feel a much greater sense of importance and value
because they feel that their manager actually trusts them.</p>
<p>Note that all of the above four qualities ought to exist in concert.
A boss who is relentless but not trusting might seek to “keep people on
their toes” by being erratic or unpredictable—a sure way to hurt
performance and morale. A boss who is challenging but not curious may
come across as a bully, while a boss who’s trusting but not challenging
will seem like a pushover. In short, there is a clear difference between
making work meaningful and making it fun or easy, just like there is a
big difference between an engaged and a happy employee. Whereas
engagement results in enthusiasm, drive, and motivation—all of which
increase performance and are therefore valuable to the
organization—happiness can lead to complacency. To be a good leader,
focus on helping employees find meaning in their achievements, rather
than just enjoy their time at the office.</p>
