<h4 id="if-you-aspire-to-be-a-great-leader-be-present">5 If You Aspire
to Be a Great Leader, Be Present</h4>
<p>By Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter</p>
<p>Some years ago, we worked with a director of a multinational pharma
company who’d been receiving poor grades for engagement and leadership
effectiveness. Although he tried to change, nothing seemed to work. As
his frustration grew, he started tracking the time he spent with each of
his direct reports—and every time he received bad feedback, he pulled
out his data and exclaimed, “But look how much time I spend with
everyone!”</p>
<p>Things improved when he began a daily 10- minute mindfulness
practice. After a couple of months, people found him more engaging,
nicer to work with, and more inspiring. He was surprised and elated by
the results. The real surprise? When he pulled out his time-tracking
spreadsheet, he saw that he was spending, on average, 21% less time with
his people.</p>
<p>The difference? He was actually there.</p>
<p>He came to understand that, even though he was in the same room with
someone, he wasn’t always fully present. He let himself become
preoccupied with other activities or let his mind drift to other things.
And, most of all, he’d listen to his inner voice when someone was
talking. Because of his lack of presence, people felt unheard and
frustrated.</p>
<p>Our inner voices are the commentaries we lend to our experiences.
They often say things like, “I wish he would stop talking.” Or, “I know
what she’s going to say next.” Or, “I’ve heard this all before.” Or, “I
wonder if Joe has responded to my text.”</p>
<p>To truly engage other human beings and create meaningful connections,
we need to silence our inner voices and be fully present—and being more
mindful can help.</p>
<p>As part of the research for our book, The Mind of the Leader, we
surveyed more than 1,000 leaders who indicated that a more mindful
presence is the optimal strategy to engage their people, create better
connections, and improve performance.</p>
<p>Other research bears this out. In a survey of 2,000 employees, Bain
andandandand Company found that among 33 leader ship traits—including
creating compelling objectives, expressing ideas clearly, and being
receptive to input—the ability to be mindfully present (also called
centeredness) is the most essential of all.1</p>
<p>Research also suggests that there’s a direct correlation between
leaders’ mindfulness and the well-being and performance of their
people.2 In other words, the more a leader is present with their people,
the better they will perform.</p>
<p>Based on our work, here are some tips and strategies that may help in
your quest to be more present in your daily life.</p>
<p>Be here now</p>
<p>Like all CEOs, Dominic Barton, who was global managing director of
McKinsey andandandand Company, knows about having a daily schedule of
back-to-back meetings. All of these meetings are important, all include
complex information, and most require far-reaching decisions. Under
these conditions, being present moment to moment, meeting after meeting,
is a challenge. But in Barton’s experience, presence is not a choice.
It’s a necessity.</p>
<p>“When I’m with people during the day, I’m doing my best to be
focused, I’m present with them,” he told us. “Part of this is because I
get energy from being with people. But the other part is because if
you’re not focused, if you’re not present, it’s discouraging to the
other people. They lose motivation. If you’re not present, I think you
may as well not have the meeting. It can sometimes be difficult to do,
but it’s always important.”</p>
<p>The person in front of you does not know what you were dealing with a
moment ago, nor should they. It’s your responsibility to show up and be
fully present to effectively use the limited time you have with each
person you meet.</p>
<p>Barton believes being mindfully present requires discipline and
skill. It takes discipline to stay on task and not let yourself be
affected by nagging challenges or distracted by mental chatter. And it
requires skill to have the mental ability to stay laser focused and
present. When he’s present throughout his day, he finds it deeply
gratifying. Being present becomes the cornerstone to getting the most
out of every moment with each person.</p>
<p>Plan for presence</p>
<p>In his decade as CEO of Campbell Soup Company, Doug Conant developed
rituals for physically and psychologically connecting with people at all
levels in the company, which he called touchpoints.</p>
<p>Every morning, Conant allocated a good chunk of his time to walking
around the plant, greeting people, and getting to know them. He would
memorize their names and the names of their family members. He would
take a genuine interest in their lives. He also handwrote letters of
gratitude to recognize extraordinary efforts. And when people in the
company were having tough times, he wrote them personal messages of
encouragement. During his tenure, he sent more than 30,000 such
letters.</p>
<p>To Conant, these behaviors were not just strategies to enhance
productivity; they were heartfelt efforts to support his people.</p>
<p>Do less, be more</p>
<p>Gabrielle Thompson, senior vice president at Cisco, has found that
when an employee comes to her with a challenge, sometimes it needs a
simple solution. But often, the problem just needs to be heard. “Many
situations simply need an ear, not action. Oftentimes, problems don’t
need solutions—they need presence and time,” she says. As leaders,
having the ability to be fully present and listen with an open mind is
often the most powerful way to solve issues.</p>
<p>As a leader, your role can be simply to create the safe space for
people to air their frustrations and process their problems. Through
mindful presence, you become the container in which they have space to
process the issue, without you stepping in to solve, fix, manipulate, or
control the situation. Presence in itself can help resolve the issue.
This kind of presence not only solves the problem but also creates
greater connection and engagement.</p>
<p>Embodied presence</p>
<p>Loren Shuster, chief people officer at the LEGO Group, explained that
when he has very important meetings or presentations, he takes five
minutes to ground himself in his body. He visualizes coming fully alive
in each cell of his body. As he explained to us, “When you’re not
grounded, when you’re not connected to your body and surrounding
environment, you don’t have a strong sense of direction or purpose.
You’re just floating. The smallest thing can distract you. This
grounding technique helps me clear my mind, recharge my energy,
strengthen my instincts, and calm my emotions.”</p>
<p>After this five-minute practice, he walks differently, he talks
differently. With more gravitas. With more weight. With more vigor. And
as a result, he’s able to be more fully present mentally and physically
with those around him. It grounds him in the room like a rock.</p>
<p>When we have embodied presence, our posture shifts. Rather than
slouching, crossing our arms, and literally closing in on ourselves, we
assume a more balanced, uplifted, open, and inclusive posture. This
includes sitting up straight, with our arms open.</p>
<p>This shift in posture can influence how we think, behave, and
communicate. In the same way that we can catalyze qualities like
confidence through assuming a bold posture, we can induce qualities like
awareness, focus, inclusion, and compassion through an uplifted,
dignified posture.</p>
<p>The act of sitting up and opening up has a positive effect on the
chemistry of our brains. It cultivates our capacity for
higher-functioning thought processes. It gives us access to wisdom that
comes from heightened awareness, compassion that comes from increased
openness, and confidence that comes from the strength of vertical
alignment.</p>
