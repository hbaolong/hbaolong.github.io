<h4 id="how-to-practice-mindfulness-throughout-your-work-day">9 How to
Practice Mindfulness Throughout Your Work Day</h4>
<p>By Rasmus Hougaard and Jacqueline Carter</p>
<p>You probably know the feeling all too well: You arrive at the office
with a clear plan for the day, and then, in what feels like just a
moment, you find yourself on your way back home. Nine or ten hours have
passed but you’ve accomplished only a few of your priorities. And, most
likely, you can’t even remember exactly what you did all day. If this
sounds familiar, don’t worry: You’re not alone. Research shows that
people spend nearly 47% of their waking hours thinking about something
other than what they’re doing.1 In other words, many of us operate on
autopilot.</p>
<p>Add to this that we have entered what many people are calling the
“attention economy.” In the attention economy, the ability to maintain
focus and concentration is every bit as important as technical or
management skills. And because leaders must be able to absorb and
synthesize a growing flood of information in order to make good
decisions, they’re hit particularly hard by this emerging trend.</p>
<p>The good news is you can train your brain to focus better by
incorporating mindfulness exercises throughout your day. Based on our
experience with thousands of leaders in more than 250 organizations,
here are some guidelines for becoming a more focused and mindful
leader.</p>
<p>First, start off your day right. Researchers have found that we
release the most stress hormones within minutes after waking.2 Why?
Because thinking of the day ahead triggers our fight-or-flight instinct
and releases cortisol into our blood. Instead, try this: When you wake
up, spend two minutes in your bed simply noticing your breath. As
thoughts about the day pop into your mind, let them go and return to
your breath.</p>
<p>Next, when you get to the office, take 10 minutes at your desk or in
your car to boost your brain with the following short mindfulness
practice before you dive into activity. Close your eyes, relax, and sit
upright. Place your full focus on your breath. Simply maintain an
ongoing flow of attention on the experience of your breathing: Inhale,
exhale; inhale, exhale. To help your focus stay on your breathing, count
silently at each exhalation. Any time you find your mind distracted,
simply release the distraction by returning your focus to your breath.
Most important, allow yourself to enjoy these minutes. Throughout the
rest of the day, other people and competing urgencies will fight for
your attention. But for these 10 minutes, your attention is all your
own.</p>
<p>Once you finish this practice and get ready to start working,
mindfulness can help increase your effectiveness. Two skills define a
mindful mind: focus and awareness. Focus is the ability to concentrate
on what you’re doing in the moment, while awareness is the ability to
recognize and release unnecessary distractions as they arise. Understand
that mindfulness is not just a sedentary practice; it is about
developing a sharp, clear mind. And mindfulness in action is a great
alternative to the illusory practice of multitasking. Mindful working
means applying focus and awareness to everything you do from the moment
you enter the office. Focus on the task at hand, and recognize and
release internal and external distractions as they arise. In this way,
mindfulness helps increase effectiveness, decrease mistakes, and even
enhance creativity.</p>
<p>To better understand the power of focus and awareness, consider an
affliction that touches nearly all of us: email addiction. Emails have a
way of seducing our attention and redirecting it to lower-priority tasks
because completing small, quickly accomplished tasks releases dopamine,
a pleasurable hormone, in our brains. This release makes us addicted to
email and compromises our concentration. Instead, apply mindfulness when
opening your inbox. Focus on what is important and maintain awareness of
what is merely noise. To get a better start to your day, avoid checking
your email first thing in the morning. Doing so will help you sidestep
an onslaught of distractions and short-term problems during a time of
day that holds the potential for exceptional focus and creativity.</p>
<p>As the day moves on and the inevitable back-to-back meetings start,
mindfulness can help you lead shorter, more effective meetings. To avoid
entering a meeting with a wandering mind, take two minutes to practice
mindfulness, which you can do en route. Even better, let the first two
minutes of the meeting be silent, allowing everybody to arrive both
physically and mentally. Then, if possible, end the meeting five minutes
before the hour to allow all participants a mindful transition to their
next appointment.</p>
<p>As the day progresses and your brain starts to tire, mindfulness can
help you stay sharp and avoid poor decisions. After lunch, set a timer
on your phone to ring every hour. When the timer rings, cease your
current activity and do one minute of mindfulness practice. These
mindful performance breaks will help keep you from resorting to
autopilot and lapsing into action addiction.</p>
<p>Finally, as the day comes to an end and you start your commute home,
apply mindfulness. For at least 10 minutes of the commute, turn off your
phone, shut off the radio, and simply be. Let go of any thoughts that
arise. Attend to your breath. Doing so will allow you to let go of the
stresses of the day so you can return home and be fully present with
your family.</p>
<p>Mindfulness is not about living life in slow motion. It’s about
enhancing focus and awareness both in work and in life. It’s about
stripping away distractions and staying on track with both individual
and organizational, goals. Take control of your own mindfulness: Test
these tips for 14 days, and see what they do for you.</p>
