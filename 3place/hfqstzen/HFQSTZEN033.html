<h4 id="the-authenticity-paradox">2 The Authenticity Paradox</h4>
<p>By Herminia Ibarra</p>
<p>Authenticity has become the gold standard for leadership. But a
simplistic understanding of what it means can hinder your growth and
limit your impact.</p>
<p>Consider Cynthia, a general manager in a health care organization.
Her promotion into that role increased her direct reports tenfold and
expanded the range of businesses she oversaw—and she felt a little shaky
about making such a big leap. A strong believer in transparent,
collaborative leadership, she bared her soul to her new employees: “I
want to do this job,” she said, “but it’s scary, and I need your help.”
Her candor backfired; she lost credibility with people who wanted and
needed a confident leader to take charge.</p>
<p>Or take George, a Malaysian executive in an auto parts company where
people valued a clear chain of command and made decisions by consensus.
When a Dutch multinational with a matrix structure acquired the company,
George found himself working with peers who saw decision making as a
freewheeling contest for the best-debated ideas. That style didn’t come
easily to him, and it contradicted everything he had learned about
humility growing up in his country. In a 360-degree debrief, his boss
told him that he needed to sell his ideas and accomplishments more
aggressively. George felt he had to choose between being a failure and
being a fake.</p>
<p>Because going against our natural inclinations can make us feel like
impostors, we tend to latch on to authenticity as an excuse for sticking
with what’s comfortable. But few jobs allow us to do that for long.
That’s doubly true when we advance in our careers or when demands or
expectations change, as Cynthia, George, and countless other executives
have discovered.</p>
<p>In my research on leadership transitions, I have observed that career
advances require all of us to move way beyond our comfort zones. At the
same time, however, they trigger a strong countervailing impulse to
protect our identities: When we are unsure of ourselves or our ability
to perform well or measure up in a new setting, we often retreat to
familiar behaviors and styles.</p>
<p>But my research also demonstrates that the moments that most
challenge our sense of self are the ones that can teach us the most
about leading effectively. By viewing ourselves as works in progress and
evolving our professional identities through trial and error, we can
develop a personal style that feels right to us and suits our
organizations’ changing needs.</p>
<p>That takes courage, because learning, by definition, starts with
unnatural and often superficial behaviors that can make us feel
calculating instead of genuine and spontaneous. But the only way to
avoid being pigeonholed and ultimately become better leaders is to do
the things that a rigidly authentic sense of self would keep us from
doing.</p>
<p>Why leaders struggle with authenticity</p>
<p>The word “authentic” traditionally referred to any work of art that
is an original, not a copy. When used to describe leadership, of course,
it has other meanings—and they can be problematic. For example, the
notion of adhering to one “true self” flies in the face of much research
on how people evolve with experience, discovering facets of themselves
they would never have unearthed through introspection alone. And being
utterly transparent—disclosing every single thought and feeling—is both
unrealistic and risky. (See figure 1, “What is authenticity?”)</p>
<p>FIGURE 1</p>
<p>What is authenticity?</p>
<p>Leaders today struggle with authenticity for several reasons. First,
we make more-frequent and more-radical changes in the kinds of work we
do. As we strive to improve our game, a clear and firm sense of self is
a compass that helps us navigate choices and progress toward our goals.
But when we’re looking to change our game, a too-rigid self-concept
becomes an anchor that keeps us from sailing forth, as it did at first
with Cynthia.</p>
<p>Second, in global business, many of us work with people who don’t
share our cultural norms and have different expectations for how we
should behave. It can often seem as if we have to choose between what is
expected—and therefore effective—and what feels authentic. George is a
case in point.</p>
<p>Third, identities are always on display in today’s world of
ubiquitous connectivity and social media. How we present ourselves—not
just as executives but as people, with quirks and broader interests—has
become an important aspect of leadership. Having to carefully curate a
persona that’s out there for all to see can clash with our private sense
of self.</p>
<p>In dozens of interviews with talented executives facing new
expectations, I have found that they most often grapple with
authenticity in the following situations.</p>
<p>Taking charge in an unfamiliar role</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the first 90 days are critical in a new leadership
role. First impressions form quickly, and they matter. Depending on
their personalities, leaders respond very differently to the increased
visibility and performance pressure.</p>
<p>Psychologist Mark Snyder, of the University of Minnesota, identified
two psychological profiles that inform how leaders develop their
personal styles. “High self-monitors”—or chameleons, as I call them—are
naturally able and willing to adapt to the demands of a situation
without feeling fake. Chameleons care about managing their public image
and often mask their vulnerability with bluster. They may not always get
it right the first time, but they keep trying on different styles like
new clothes until they find a good fit for themselves and their
circumstances. Because of that flexibility, they often advance rapidly.
But chameleons can run into problems when people perceive them as
disingenuous or lacking a moral center—even though they’re expressing
their “true” chameleon nature.</p>
<p>By contrast, “true-to-selfers” (Snyder’s “low self-monitors”) tend to
express what they really think and feel, even when it runs counter to
situational demands. The danger with true-to-selfers like Cynthia and
George is that they may stick too long with comfortable behavior that
prevents them from meeting new requirements, instead of evolving their
style as they gain insight and experience.</p>
<p>Cynthia (whom I interviewed after her story appeared in a Wall Street
Journal article by Carol Hymowitz) hemmed herself in like this. She
thought she was setting herself up for success by staying true to her
highly personal, full-disclosure style of management. She asked her new
team for support, openly acknowledging that she felt a bit at sea. As
she scrambled to learn unfamiliar aspects of the business, she worked
tirelessly to contribute to every decision and solve every problem.
After a few months, she was on the verge of burnout. To make matters
worse, sharing her vulnerability with her team members so early on had
damaged her standing. Reflecting on her transition some years later,
Cynthia told me: “Being authentic doesn’t mean that you can be held up
to the light and people can see right through you.” But at the time,
that was how she saw it—and instead of building trust, she made people
question her ability to do the job.</p>
<p>Delegating and communicating appropriately are only part of the
problem in a case like this. A deeper-seated issue is finding the right
mix of distance and closeness in an unfamiliar situation. Stanford
psychologist Deborah Gruenfeld describes this as managing the tension
between authority and approachability. To be authoritative, you
privilege your knowledge, experience, and expertise over the team’s,
maintaining a measure of distance. To be approachable, you emphasize
your relationships with people, their input, and their perspective, and
you lead with empathy and warmth. Getting the balance right presents an
acute authenticity crisis for true-to-selfers, who typically have a
strong preference for behaving one way or the other. Cynthia made
herself too approachable and vulnerable, and it undermined and drained
her. In her bigger role, she needed more distance from her employees to
gain their confidence and get the job done.</p>
<p>Selling your ideas (and yourself)</p>
<p>Leadership growth usually involves a shift from having good ideas to
pitching them to diverse stakeholders. Inexperienced leaders, especially
true-to-selfers, often find the process of getting buy-in distasteful
because it feels artificial and political; they believe that their work
should stand on its own merits.</p>
<p>Here’s an example: Anne, a senior manager at a transportation
company, had doubled revenue and fundamentally redesigned core processes
in her unit. Despite her obvious accomplishments, however, her boss
didn’t consider her an inspirational leader. Anne also knew she was not
communicating effectively in her role as a board member of the parent
company. The chairman, a broad-brush thinker, often became impatient
with her detail orientation. His feedback to her was “step up, do the
vision thing.” But to Anne that seemed like valuing form over substance.
“For me, it is manipulation,” she told me in an interview. “I can do the
storytelling too, but I refuse to play on people’s emotions. If the
string-pulling is too obvious, I can’t make myself do it.” Like many
aspiring leaders, she resisted crafting emotional messages to influence
and inspire others because that felt less authentic to her than relying
on facts, figures, and spreadsheets. As a result, she worked at
cross-purposes with the board chairman, pushing hard on the facts
instead of pulling him in as a valued ally.</p>
<p>Many managers know deep down that their good ideas and strong
potential will go unnoticed if they don’t do a better job of selling
themselves. Still, they can’t bring themselves to do it. “I try to build
a network based on professionalism and what I can deliver for the
business, not who I know,” one manager told me. “Maybe that’s not smart
from a career point of view. But I can’t go against my beliefs . . . So
I have been more limited in ‘networking up.’”</p>
<p>Until we see career advancement as a way of extending our reach and
increasing our impact in the organization—a collective win, not just a
selfish pursuit—we have trouble feeling authentic when touting our
strengths to influential people. True-to-selfers find it particularly
hard to sell themselves to senior management when they most need to do
so: when they are still unproven. Research shows, however, that this
hesitancy disappears as people gain experience and become more certain
of the value they bring.</p>
<p>Processing negative feedback</p>
<p>Many successful executives encounter serious negative feedback for
the first time in their careers when they take on larger roles or
responsibilities. Even when the criticisms aren’t exactly new, they loom
larger because the stakes are higher. But leaders often convince
themselves that dysfunctional aspects of their “natural” style are the
inevitable price of being effective.</p>
<p>Let’s look at Jacob, a food company production manager whose direct
reports gave him low marks in a 360 review on emotional intelligence,
team building, and empowering others. One team member wrote that it was
hard for Jacob to accept criticism. Another remarked that after an angry
outburst, he’d suddenly make a joke as if nothing had happened, not
realizing the destabilizing effect of his mood changes on those around
him. For someone who genuinely believed that he’d built trust among his
people, all this was tough to swallow.</p>
<p>Once the initial shock had subsided, Jacob acknowledged that this was
not the first time he’d received such criticism (some colleagues and
subordinates had made similar comments a few years earlier). “I thought
I’d changed my approach,” he reflected, “but I haven’t really changed so
much since the last time.” However, he quickly rationalized his behavior
to his boss: “Sometimes you have to be tough in order to deliver
results, and people don’t like it,” he said. “You have to accept that as
part of the job description.” Of course, he was missing the point.
Because negative feedback given to leaders often centers on style rather
than skills or expertise, it can feel like a threat to their identity—as
if they’re being asked to give up their “secret sauce.” That’s how Jacob
saw it. Yes, he could be explosive—but from his point of view, his
“toughness” allowed him to deliver results year after year. In reality,
though, he had succeeded up to this point despite his behavior. When his
role expanded and he took on greater responsibility, his intense
scrutiny of subordinates became an even bigger obstacle because it took
up time he should have been devoting to more-strategic pursuits.</p>
<p>A great public example of this phenomenon is Margaret Thatcher. Those
who worked with her knew she could be merciless if someone failed to
prepare as thoroughly as she did. She was capable of humiliating a staff
member in public, she was a notoriously bad listener, and she believed
that compromise was cowardice. As she became known to the world as the
“Iron Lady,” Thatcher grew more and more convinced of the rightness of
her ideas and the necessity of her coercive methods. She could beat
anyone into submission with the power of her rhetoric and conviction,
and she only got better at it. Eventually, though, it was her
undoing—she was ousted by her own cabinet.</p>
<p>WHY COMPANIES ARE PUSHING AUTHENTICITY TRAINING</p>
<p>Source: New York Times, Financial Times, Washington Post, Economic
Post, Forbes, Wall Street Journal, and HBR</p>
<p>Managers can choose from countless books, articles, and executive
workshops for advice on how to be more authentic at work. Two trends
help explain the exploding popularity of the concept and the training
industry it has fed.</p>
<p>First, trust in business leaders fell to an all-time low in 2012,
according to the Edelman Trust Barometer. Even in 2013, when trust began
to climb back up, only 18% of people reported that they trusted business
leaders to tell the truth, and fewer than half trusted businesses to do
the right thing.</p>
<p>Second, employee engagement is at a nadir. A 2013 Gallup poll found
that only 13% of employees worldwide are engaged at work. Only one in
eight workers—out of roughly 180 million employees studied—is
psychologically committed to his or her job. In study after study,
frustration, burnout, disillusionment, and misalignment with personal
values are cited among the biggest reasons for career change.</p>
<p>At a time when public confidence and employee morale are so low, it’s
no surprise that companies are encouraging leaders to discover their
“true” selves.</p>
<p>A playful frame of mind</p>
<p>Such a rigid self-concept can result from too much introspection.
When we look only within for answers, we inadvertently reinforce old
ways of seeing the world and outdated views of ourselves. Without the
benefit of what I call outsight—the valuable external perspective we get
from experimenting with new leadership behaviors—habitual patterns of
thought and action fence us in. To begin thinking like leaders, we must
first act: plunge ourselves into new projects and activities, interact
with very different kinds of people, and experiment with new ways of
getting things done. Especially in times of transition and uncertainty,
thinking and introspection should follow experience—not vice versa.
Action changes who we are and what we believe is worth doing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are ways of increasing outsight and evolving
toward an “adaptively authentic” way of leading, but they require a
playful frame of mind. Think of leadership development as trying on
possible selves rather than working on yourself—which, let’s face it,
sounds like drudgery. When we adopt a playful attitude, we’re more open
to possibilities. It’s OK to be inconsistent from one day to the next.
That’s not being a fake; it’s how we experiment to figure out what’s
right for the new challenges and circumstances we face.</p>
<p>My research suggests three important ways to get started.</p>
<p>Learn from diverse role models</p>
<p>Most learning necessarily involves some form of imitation—and the
understanding that nothing is “original.” An important part of growing
as a leader is viewing authenticity not as an intrinsic state but as the
ability to take elements you have learned from others’ styles and
behaviors and make them your own.</p>
<p>But don’t copy just one person’s leadership style; tap many diverse
role models. There is a big difference between imitating someone
wholesale and borrowing selectively from various people to create your
own collage, which you then modify and improve. As the playwright Wilson
Mizner said, copying one author is plagiarism, but copying many is
research.</p>
<p>I observed the importance of this approach in a study of investment
bankers and consultants who were advancing from analytical and project
work to roles advising clients and selling new business. Though most of
them felt incompetent and insecure in their new positions, the
chameleons among them consciously borrowed styles and tactics from
successful senior leaders—learning through emulation how to use humor to
break tension in meetings, for instance, and how to shape opinion
without being overbearing. Essentially, the chameleons faked it until
they found what worked for them. Noticing their efforts, their managers
provided coaching and mentoring and shared tacit knowledge.</p>
<p>As a result, the chameleons arrived much faster at an authentic but
more skillful style than the true-to-selfers in the study, who continued
to focus solely on demonstrating technical mastery. Often the
true-to-selfers concluded that their managers were “all talk and little
content” and therefore not suitable role models. In the absence of a
“perfect” model they had a harder time with imitation—it felt bogus.
Unfortunately, their managers perceived their inability to adapt as a
lack of effort or investment and thus didn’t give them as much mentoring
and coaching as they gave the chameleons.</p>
<p>Work on getting better</p>
<p>Setting goals for learning (not just for performance) helps us
experiment with our identities without feeling like impostors, because
we don’t expect to get every thing right from the start. We stop trying
to protect our comfortable old selves from the threats that change can
bring and start exploring what kinds of leaders we might become.</p>
<p>Of course, we all want to perform well in a new situation—get the
right strategy in place, execute like crazy, deliver results the
organization cares about. But focusing exclusively on those things makes
us afraid to take risks in the service of learning. In a series of
ingenious experiments, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck has shown that
concern about how we will appear to others inhibits learning on new or
unfamiliar tasks. Performance goals motivate us to show others that we
possess valued attributes, such as intelligence and social skill, and to
prove to ourselves that we have them. By contrast, learning goals
motivate us to develop valued attributes.</p>
<p>When we’re in performance mode, leadership is about presenting
ourselves in the most favorable light. In learning mode, we can
reconcile our yearning for authenticity in how we work and lead with an
equally powerful desire to grow. One leader I met was highly effective
in small-group settings but struggled to convey openness to new ideas in
larger meetings, where he often stuck to long-winded presentations for
fear of getting derailed by others’ comments. He set himself a “no
PowerPoint” rule to develop a more relaxed, improvisational style. He
surprised himself by how much he learned, not only about his own
evolving preferences but also about the issues at hand.</p>
<p>THE CULTURAL FACTOR</p>
<p>Whatever the situation—taking charge in unfamiliar territory, selling
your ideas and yourself, or processing negative feedback—finding
authentic ways of being effective is even more difficult in a
multicultural environment.</p>
<p>As my INSEAD colleague Erin Meyer finds in her research, styles of
persuading others and the kinds of arguments that people find persuasive
are far from universal; they are deeply rooted in a culture’s
philosophical, religious, and educational assumptions. That said,
prescriptions for how leaders are supposed to look and sound are rarely
as diverse as the leaders themselves. And despite corporate initiatives
to build understanding of cultural differences and promote diversity,
the fact is that leaders are still expected to express ideas
assertively, to claim credit for them, and to use charisma to motivate
and inspire people. Authenticity is supposed to be an antidote to a
single model of leadership. (After all, the message is to be yourself,
not what someone else expects you to be.) But as the notion has gained
currency, it has, ironically, come to mean something much more limiting
and culturally specific. A closer look at how leaders are taught to
discover and demonstrate authenticity—by telling a personal story about
a hardship they have overcome, for example—reveals a model that is, in
fact, very American, based on ideals such as self-disclosure, humility,
and individualistic triumph over adversity.</p>
<p>This amounts to a catch-22 for managers from cultures with different
norms for authority, communication, and collective endeavor because they
must behave inauthentically in order to conform to the strictures of
“authentic” leadership.</p>
<p>Don’t stick to “your story”</p>
<p>Most of us have personal narratives about defining moments that
taught us important lessons. Consciously or not, we allow our stories,
and the images of ourselves that they paint, to guide us in new
situations. But the stories can become outdated as we grow, so sometimes
it’s necessary to alter them dramatically or even to throw them out and
start from scratch.</p>
<p>That was true for Maria, a leader who saw herself as a “mother hen
with her chicks all around.” Her coach, former Ogilvy andandandand
Mather CEO Charlotte Beers, explains in I’d Rather Be in Charge that
this self-image emerged from a time when Maria had to sacrifice her own
goals and dreams to take care of her extended family. It eventually
began to hold her back in her career: Though it had worked for her as a
friendly and loyal team player and a peacekeeper, it wasn’t helping her
get the big leadership assignment she wanted. Together Maria and her
coach looked for another defining moment to use as a touchstone—one that
was more in keeping with Maria’s desired future self, not who she had
been in the past. They chose the time when Maria, as a young woman, had
left her family to travel the world for 18 months. Acting from that
bolder sense of self, she asked for—and got—a promotion that had
previously been elusive.</p>
<p>Dan McAdams, a Northwestern psychology professor who has spent his
career studying life stories, describes identity as “the internalized
and evolving story that results from a person’s selective appropriation
of past, present, and future.” This isn’t just academic jargon. McAdams
is saying that you have to believe your story—but also embrace how it
changes over time, according to what you need it to do. Try out new
stories about yourself, and keep editing them, much as you would your
résumé.</p>
<p>Again, revising one’s story is both an introspective and a social
process. The narratives we choose should not only sum up our experiences
and aspirations but also reflect the demands we face and resonate with
the audience we’re trying to win over.</p>

<p>Countless books and advisers tell you to start your leadership
journey with a clear sense of who you are. But that can be a recipe for
staying stuck in the past. Your leadership identity can and should
change each time you move on to bigger and better things.</p>
<p>The only way we grow as leaders is by stretching the limits of who we
are—doing new things that make us uncomfortable but that teach us
through direct experience who we want to become. Such growth doesn’t
require a radical personality makeover. Small changes—in the way we
carry ourselves, the way we communicate, the way we interact—often make
a world of difference in how effectively we lead.</p>
