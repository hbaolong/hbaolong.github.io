<h4 id="you-dont-just-need-one-leadership-voiceyou-need-many">8 You
Don’t Just Need One Leadership Voice—You Need Many</h4>
<p>By Amy Jen Su</p>
<p>We often equate developing a leadership voice with finding ways to
appear more confident. We assume that our success depends on mimicking
someone else, increasing our self-promotion, or saying things more
loudly than others. But rather than living with imposter’s syndrome, or
feeling exhausted by wearing your game face all day, you can build a
truer confidence by more intentionally focusing on cultivating many
different parts of your leadership voice each day. Ultimately, you
should cultivate enough parts of your voice so that no matter the
leadership situation or audience you find yourself facing, you can
respond in an authentic, constructive, and effective way. So, what are
the various voices to access within yourself and cultivate over time?
And what are the situations that warrant each voice?</p>
<p>Your voice of character</p>
<p>First and foremost, consider the voice of your character. This is the
part of your voice that is constant and consistent. It is grounded in
fundamental principles about whom you choose to be and what guides and
motivates your interactions with others. I’ve had leaders share that
they hold key leadership principles in mind such as “Give the benefit of
the doubt,” “Don’t take things personally,” “Focus on what’s best for
the business,” or “Be direct with respect” when walking into a difficult
conversation, meeting, or potential conflict. Anchoring ourselves in the
character we know we have keeps us from becoming chameleons, acting out
of a fight-or-flight reaction, or only showing respect when there is a
commercial gain or benefit—while being uncivil to others who we believe
are of less value. A voice of character is ultimately about who you are
and the intentions and motivations that guide your speech and
actions.</p>
<p>Your voice of context</p>
<p>As you take on increasingly senior roles, your view and perspective
of the business grow. You hold more of the big picture. Part of the job
then becomes finding ways to express and communicate that bigger picture
to others. Too often, in the race against time, we dive right into the
details of a presentation, meeting, or conversation without taking an
extra few minutes to appropriately set the stage and share critical
context. Places where you can bring more of your voice of context
include:</p>
<p>Sharing vision, strategy, or upcoming organizational change with
others</p>
<p>Presenting to executives, and being clear on what you are there for
and what you need</p>
<p>Kicking off a meeting with your team and giving the bigger picture
for the topic at hand</p>
<p>Making your decision-making criteria or ration ale transparent to
others</p>
<p>Your voice of clarity</p>
<p>In a world of high-intensity workplaces, you have the opportunity to
be the voice of clarity and help your team stay focused on the most
important priorities. Leaders who envision new possibilities, muse
aloud, or have knee-jerk reactions run the risk of teams trying to
deliver on their every whim; these teams end up scattered, spread thin,
and unfocused, falling short on delivering on the most important wins.
Here are a few ways you can be the voice of clarity to help channel
others’ energies more productively:</p>
<p>At the start of the year, sit down with each direct report to
prioritize and clarify what the big wins are in each of their areas. One
client of mine shared how she asks each team member: “If we were to
publish this in a newspaper, what would you want the big headlines to be
for you and your team at the end of the year?”</p>
<p>Periodically come back to helping your direct reports reprioritize
what’s on their plates. You can do this in one-on-one meetings or with
your entire team.</p>
<p>Empower your team to say no.</p>
<p>Your voice of curiosity</p>
<p>As a leader, you have a responsibility to give direction, share
information, and make important decisions. But you need to be sure that
you’re not approaching every situation as if you have all the answers or
as if you need to advise on, problem-solve, or fix everything in front
of you. In many cases, being the voice of curiosity is a better choice
for the situation. As one of my clients once shared about facing
pushback from others, “While I’m confident in my own business judgment
and instincts, I know that my organization has hired really smart
people. Therefore, if one of my peers or team members has a different
perspective or pushes back, I don’t take it personally. I get really
curious to understand where they are coming from first so that we can
get to the best solution.” Some situations where bringing your voice of
curiosity can help you and your colleagues move forward:</p>
<p>When you’re engaging in work that is interdependent, and a better
solution will come from hearing all perspectives in the room before
coming to a final decision</p>
<p>When you’re coaching a direct report, asking good questions to help
them grow in new ways, explore issues they’re facing, or support their
career development</p>
<p>When you’re in a difficult conversation where hearing out the other
person is an important part of defusing emotion, understanding each
party’s needs and views, and then figuring out the best way forward</p>
<p>Your voice of connection</p>
<p>As your span of control or influence grows, it can become
increasingly more difficult to make a connection with a broadening set
of colleagues, strategic networks, and teams. We often have folks
working for us many layers deep into the organization, such that we no
longer know everyone in our area and still must find ways to stay
connected and visible. Being a voice of connection can come in many
forms. Some of the ways I’ve seen others do this effectively:</p>
<p>Increase your skill as a storyteller. Stories make our points more
memorable and salient. They can enliven a keynote address or an
all-hands meeting, drive home a point we’re making in a presentation, or
help to close a large deal or transaction.</p>
<p>Thank and acknowledge. Our teams and colleagues often go to great
lengths to ensure that deliverables are met, revenues are strong, and
customers are satisfied. When we use our voice of connection, we
remember to express gratitude to a team that worked through the holidays
to close on the financials at the end of the quarter, or we remember to
loop back with a colleague who made a valuable introduction or referral
for us.</p>
<p>Making time for a few minutes of icebreaking or rapport building at
the start of a conversation or meeting. So often, we want to get right
down to business, so we skip the niceties or pleasantries that help to
build relationships with others. Where possible, and especially with
colleagues who value that kind of connection, spend a couple of minutes
to connect before diving into the work. On days where you’re crunched
for time, state that up front and transparently, so as not to create any
misunderstandings. You can say something like: “I’m a little crunched
for time today, so it would be great if we could dive right in.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Discovering and developing your voice as a leader is the work of a
lifetime. The key is to stay open to an increasingly wide array of new
situations and people. Use each situation as an opportunity to access
more parts of your voice, rather than having a one-size-fits-all
approach. Bring your voices of character, context, clarity, curiosity,
and connection as the moment or situation warrants. Through this kind of
learning and growth, not only will you increase your inner confidence
and resilience, but you will also inspire the confidence of others
around you in a more authentic and impactful way.</p>
