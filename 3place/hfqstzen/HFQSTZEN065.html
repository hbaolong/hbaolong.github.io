<h4 id="you-dont-find-your-purposeyou-build-it">3 You Don’t Find Your
Purpose—You Build It</h4>
<p>By John Coleman</p>
<p>How do I find my purpose?”</p>
<p>Ever since Daniel Gulati, Oliver Segovia, and I published our book
Passion and Purpose six years ago, I’ve received hundreds of
questions—from younger and older people alike—about purpose. We’re all
looking for purpose. Most of us feel that we’ve never found it, we’ve
lost it, or in some way we’re falling short.</p>
<p>But in the midst of all this angst, I think we’re also suffering from
what I see as fundamental misconceptions about purpose, neatly
encapsulated by the question I receive most frequently: How do I find my
purpose? Challenging these misconceptions can help us all develop a more
well-rounded vision of purpose.</p>
<p>Misconception #1: Purpose is only a thing you find</p>
<p>On social media, I often see an inspiring quotation attributed to
Mark Twain: “The two most important days in your life are the day you
are born and the day you find out why.” It neatly articulates what I’ll
call the “Hollywood version” of purpose. Like Neo in The Matrix or Rey
in Star Wars, we’re all just moving through life waiting until fate
delivers a higher calling to us.</p>
<p>Make no mistake: That can happen, at least in some form. I recently
saw Scott Harrison, founder and CEO of respected nonprofit Charity:
Water, speak, and in many ways his story was about how he found a higher
purpose after a period of wandering. But I think it’s more rare than
most people think. For the average 20-year-old in college or 40-year-old
in an unfulfilling job, searching for the silver bullet to give life
meaning is more likely to end in frustration than fulfillment.</p>
<p>In achieving professional purpose, most of us have to focus as much
on making our work meaningful as in taking meaning from it. Put
differently, purpose is a thing you build, not a thing you find. Almost
any work can possess remarkable purpose. School bus drivers bear
enormous responsibility—caring for and keeping safe dozens of
children—and are an essential part of assuring our children receive the
education they need and deserve. Nurses play an essential role not
simply in treating people’s medical conditions but also in guiding them
through some of life’s most difficult times. Cashiers can be a friendly,
uplifting interaction in someone’s day—often desperately needed—or a
forgettable or regrettable one. But in each of these instances, purpose
is often primarily derived from focusing on what’s so meaningful and
purposeful about the job and on doing it in such a way that that meaning
is enhanced and takes center stage. Sure, some jobs more naturally lend
themselves to a sense of meaning, but many require at least some
deliberate effort to invest them with the purpose we seek.</p>
<p>Misconception #2: Purpose is a single thing</p>
<p>The second misconception I often hear is that purpose can be
articulated as a single thing. Some people genuinely do seem to have an
overwhelming purpose in their lives. Mother Teresa lived her life to
serve the poor. Samuel Johnson poured every part of himself into his
writing. Marie Curie devoted her energy to her work.</p>
<p>And yet even these luminaries had other sources of purpose in their
lives. Mother Teresa served the poor as part of what she believed was a
higher calling. Curie, the Nobel prize–winning scientist, was also a
devoted wife and mother (she wrote a biography of her husband, Pierre,
and one of her daughters—Irene—won her own Nobel prize). And Johnson,
beyond his writing, was known to be a great humanitarian in his
community, often caring personally for the poor.</p>
<p>Most of us will have multiple sources of purpose in our lives. I find
purpose in my children, my marriage, my faith, my writing, my work, and
my community. For almost everyone, there’s no one thing we can find.
It’s not purpose but purposes we are looking for: the multiple sources
of meaning that help us find value in our work and lives. Professional
commitments are only one component of this meaning, and often our work
isn’t central to our purpose but a conduit to helping others, including
our families and communities. Acknowledging that there are multiple
sources of purpose takes the pressure off of finding one single thing to
give our lives meaning.</p>
<p>Misconception #3: Purpose is stable over time</p>
<p>It’s common now for people to have multiple careers in their
lifetimes. I know one individual, for example, who recently left a
successful private equity career to found a startup. I know two more who
recently left business careers to run for elective office. And whether
or not we switch professional commitments, most of us will experience
personal phases in which our sources of meaning change—childhood, young
adulthood, parenthood, and empty-nesting, to name a few.</p>
<p>This evolution in our sources of purpose isn’t flaky or demonstrative
of a lack of commitment but rather natural and good. Just as we all find
meaning in multiple places, the sources of that meaning can and do
change over time. My focus and sense of purpose at 20 was dramatically
different in many ways than it is now, and the same could be said of
almost anyone you meet.</p>
<p>How do you find your purpose? That’s the wrong question to ask. We
should be looking to endow every thing we do with purpose, to allow for
the multiple sources of meaning that will naturally develop in our
lives, and to be comfortable with those sources changing over time.
Unpacking what we mean by “purpose” can allow us to better understand
its presence and role in our lives.</p>
