<h4 id="how-to-build-confidence">1 How to Build Confidence</h4>
<p>By Amy Gallo</p>
<p>Very few people succeed in business without a degree of confidence.
Yet everyone, from young people in their first real jobs to seasoned
leaders in the upper ranks of organizations, have moments—or days,
months, or even years—when they are unsure of their ability to tackle
challenges. No one is immune to these bouts of insecurity at work, but
they don’t have to hold you back.</p>
<p>What the experts say</p>
<p>“Confidence equals security equals positive emotion equals better
performance,” says Tony Schwartz, the president and CEO of The Energy
Project and the author of Be Excellent at Anything: The Four Keys to
Transforming the Way We Work and Live. And yet he concedes that
“insecurity plagues consciously or subconsciously every human being I’ve
met.” Over-coming this self-doubt starts with honestly assessing your
abilities (and your shortcomings) and then getting comfortable enough to
capitalize on (and correct) them, adds Deborah H. Gruenfeld, the
Moghadam Family Professor of Leadership and Organizational Behavior and
Codirector of the Executive Program for Women Leaders at Stanford
Graduate School of Business. Here’s how to do that and get into the
virtuous cycle that Schwartz describes.</p>
<p>Prepare</p>
<p>Your piano teacher was right: Practice does make perfect. “The best
way to build confidence in a given area is to invest energy in it and
work hard at it,” says Schwartz. Many people give up when they think
they’re not good at a particular job or task, assuming the exertion is
fruitless. But Schwartz argues that deliberate practice will almost
always trump natural aptitude. If you are unsure about your ability to
do something—speak in front of a large audience, negotiate with a tough
customer—start by trying out the skills in a safe setting. “Practice can
be very useful and is highly recommended because, in addition to
building confidence, it also tends to improve quality. Actually deliver
the big presentation more than once before the due date. Do a dry run
before opening a new store,” says Gruenfeld. Even people who are
confident in their abilities can become more so with better
preparation.</p>
<p>Get out of your own way</p>
<p>Confident people aren’t only willing to practice, they’re also
willing to acknowledge that they don’t—and can’t—know everything. “It’s
better to know when you need help than not,” says Gruenfeld. “A certain
degree of confidence—specifically, confidence in your ability to
learn—is required to be willing to admit that you need guidance or
support.”</p>
<p>On the flip side, don’t let modesty hold you back. People often get
too wrapped up in what others will think to focus on what they have to
offer, says Katie Orenstein, founder and director of The OpEd Project, a
nonprofit that empowers women to influence public policy by submitting
opinion pieces to newspapers. “When you realize your value to others,
confidence is no longer about self-promotion,” she explains. “In fact,
confidence is no longer the right word. It’s about purpose.” Instead of
agonizing about what others might think of you or your work, concentrate
on the unique perspective you bring.</p>
<p>Get feedback when you need it</p>
<p>While you don’t want to completely rely on others’ opinions to boost
your ego, validation can also be very effective in building confidence.
Gruenfeld suggests asking someone who cares about your development as
well as the quality of your performance to tell you what she thinks. Be
sure to pick people whose feedback will be entirely truthful; Gruenfeld
notes that when performance appraisals are only positive, we stop
trusting them. And then use any genuinely positive commentary you get as
a talisman.</p>
<p>Also remember that some people need more support than others, so
don’t be shy about asking for it. “The White House Project finds, for
example, that many women need to be told they should run for office
before deciding to do so. Men do not show this pattern of needing
others’ validation or encouragement,” says Gruenfeld. It’s okay if you
need praise.</p>
<p>Take risks</p>
<p>Playing to your strengths is a smart tactic but not if it means you
hesitate to take on new challenges. Many people don’t know what they are
capable of until they are truly tested. “Try things you don’t think you
can do. Failure can be very useful for building confidence,” says
Gruenfeld. Of course, this is often easier said than done. “It feels bad
to not be good at something. There’s a leap of faith with getting better
at anything,” says Schwartz. But don’t assume you should feel good all
the time. In fact, stressing yourself is the only way to grow. Enlisting
help from others can make this easier. Gruenfeld recommends asking
supervisors to let you experiment with new initiatives or skills when
the stakes are relatively low and then to support you as you tackle
those challenges.</p>
<p>Principles to remember</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Be honest with yourself about what you know and what you still need
to learn</p>
<p>Practice doing the things you are unsure about</p>
<p>Embrace new opportunities to prove you can do difficult things</p>
<p>Don’t:</p>
<p>Focus excessively on whether or not you have the ability—think
instead about the value you provide</p>
<p>Hesitate to ask for external validation if you need it</p>
<p>Worry about what others think—focus on yourself, not a theoretical
and judgmental audience</p>
<p>Case study #1: Get the knowledge and get out of your own way</p>
<p>In 2010, Mark Angelo was asked by the CEO of Hospital for Special
Surgery in New York to create and implement a program to improve quality
and efficiency. Mark was relatively new to the organization. He had
worked as a business fellow for the previous year but had recently taken
on the role of director of operations and service lines. Even though he
had background in operations strategy from his days as a management
consultant, he was not familiar with the Lean/Six Sigma principles he’d
need to use for this project and didn’t feel equipped to build the
program from scratch. He was particularly concerned he wouldn’t be able
to gain the necessary support from the hospital’s physicians and nurses.
What would they think of a young administrator with no hospital
experience telling them how to improve quality and increase
efficiency?</p>
<p>For five months, Mark struggled to get the project on track, and his
confidence suffered. He knew that his apprehension was in part due to
his lack of knowledge of Six Sigma. He read a number of books and
articles on the subject, talked to consultants who specialized in it,
and spoke with hospitals that had been successful in developing and
implementing similar programs. This helped, but he realized he still
didn’t know if he would be able to get the necessary people on board. “I
was anxious and stressed because I had no idea how I was going to
transform the organization. I knew I couldn’t do it on my own. It was
going to take a collective effort that included our management team and
all of our staff,” he said.</p>
<p>He talked with the CEO, who had supported him since the beginning. He
also looked to his family for emotional support. Through these
conversations, he realized that his anxiety stemmed from a desire to be
liked by his colleagues and therefore to avoid conflict. “After many
discussions with my CEO and observing how he handled these situations, I
learned that it is better to strive to be well-respected than
well-liked,” he said.</p>
<p>This was a turning point for Mark. Instead of worrying so much about
what others thought of him, he focused on doing what was best for the
patient and the institution. In December, he presented the vision for
the program to the entire medical staff. While he was nervous about how
it would be received, he knew this was a critical moment. “I was able to
get up in front of one of our toughest constituencies and present the
vision that we had been developing over the past few months,” he says.
His presentation was met with applause. “In the end, my confidence grew
by leaps and bounds and we were able to design a program that has since
taken off with great success across the hospital. I was able to overcome
my mental blocks and knowledge deficits to build a program that will
truly help transform how we approach performance improvement and patient
care,” he says.</p>
<p>Case study #2: Know the value you bring</p>
<p>Julie Zhuo knew she had things to say, but she wasn’t sure how to get
heard. As a product design manager at Facebook, she had developed
valuable expertise in the products she worked on. Yet she lacked the
confidence to share her ideas. She was used to being one of very few
women in the room. That had been the case when she was studying computer
science at Stanford, and it was still true now that she was at Facebook.
She knew this meant she needed to make a concerted effort to speak up.
But being the minority voice wasn’t the only reason she felt unsure of
herself. She says that she also suffered from “imposter syndrome,”
feeling as if she hadn’t earned a right to her ideas—that she had
somehow ended up where she was accidently, not through hard work.</p>
<p>Julie was intrigued when someone in HR told her about a workshop
offered at Stanford by the OpEd Project. After attending and getting
positive feedback about her ideas, Julie tried something she had never
thought to do before: write an op-ed.</p>
<p>In November 2010, she published a piece in the New York Times
entitled “Where Anonymity Breeds Contempt” about the danger of anonymity
in online discussions. “It was a matter of someone saying ‘You can do
it,’” she explains. “It had never occurred to me that I could be
published. But it actually wasn’t hard at all.” The reaction she got in
the workshop and afterward back at Facebook boosted her confidence.
Since then, she’s gotten a lot of support from colleagues, which has
emboldened her to speak her mind. “Of course it’s still a work in
progress, but now I’m a much more confident speaker and writer,” she
says.</p>
