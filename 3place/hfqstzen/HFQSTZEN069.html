Five Questions to Help Your Employees Find Their Inner Purpose</h4>
<p>By Kristi Hedges</p>
<p>How can leaders help employees find meaning at work?</p>
<p>Organizations spend considerable resources on corporate values and
mission statements, but even the most inspiring of these—from Volvo’s
commitment to safety to Facebook’s desire to connect people—tend to fade
into the background during the daily bustle of the workday.</p>
<p>What workers really need to feel engaged in and satisfied by their
jobs is an inner sense of purpose. As Deloitte found in a 2016 study,
people feel loyal to companies that support their own career and life
ambitions—in other words, what’s meaningful to them.1 And, although that
research focused on millennials, in the decade I’ve spent coaching
seasoned executives, I’ve found that it’s a common attitude across
generations. No matter one’s level, industry, or career, we all need to
find a personal sense of meaning in what we do.</p>
<p>Leaders can foster this inner sense of purpose—what matters right
now, in each individual’s life and career—with simple conversation. One
technique is action identification theory, which posits that there are
many levels of description for any action.2 For example, right now I’m
writing this article. At a low level, I’m typing words on a keyboard. At
a high level, I’m creating better leaders. When leaders walk employees
up this ladder, they can help them find meaning in even the most mundane
tasks.</p>
<p>Regular check-ins that use five areas of inquiry are another way to
help employees explore and call out their inner purpose. Leaders can
ask:</p>
<p>What are you good at doing? Which work activities require less effort
for you? What do you take on because you believe you’re the best person
to do it? What have you gotten noticed for throughout your career? The
idea here is to help people identify their strengths and open
possibilities from there.</p>
<p>What do you enjoy? In a typical workweek, what do you look forward to
doing? What do you see on your calendar that energizes you? If you could
design your job with no restrictions, how would you spend your time?
These questions help people find or rediscover what they love about
work.</p>
<p>What feels most useful? Which work outcomes make you most proud?
Which of your tasks are most critical to the team or organization? What
are the highest priorities for your life and how does your work fit in?
This line of inquiry highlights the inherent value of certain work.</p>
<p>What creates a sense of forward momentum? What are you learning that
you’ll use in the future? What do you envision for yourself next? How is
your work today getting you closer to what you want for yourself? The
goal here is to show how today’s work helps the individual advance
toward future goals.</p>
<p>How do you relate to others? Which working partnerships are best for
you? What would an office of your favorite people look like? How does
your work enhance your family and social connections? These questions
encourage people to think about and foster relationships that make work
more meaningful.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to guide others toward purpose, but these strategies
can help.</p>
