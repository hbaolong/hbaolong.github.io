<h4 id="make-your-team-feel-powerful">5 Make Your Team Feel
Powerful</h4>
<p>By Harrison Monarth</p>
<p>Research has shown that helping others feel more powerful can boost
productivity, improve performance, and leave employees feeling more
satisfied on the job. A study conducted by Yona Kifer of Tel Aviv
University and published in Psychological Science found that employees
were 26% more satisfied in their roles when they had positions of
power.1</p>
<p>Feelings of power also translated to more authenticity and feelings
of well-being, the researchers found. Power made the subjects feel more
“true to themselves,” enabling them to engage in actions that
authentically reflected values they hold dear. This subjective sense of
authenticity in turn created a higher sense of well-being and
happiness.</p>
<p>Yet Gallup research has found that an astonishing 70% of American
workers aren’t engaged or committed to their employers. Gallup estimates
the cost of their apathy at between 50 billion and 50 billion in lost
productivity per year.2 I’m guessing those workers aren’t feeling all
that powerful.</p>
<p>While it would be great to think we could just repeat a mantra each
morning to facilitate these wellbeing-enhancing feelings of power,
another global study conducted by Gallup found that among some 600,000
workers across several industries, leadership support, recognition,
constant communication, and trust were essential to creating a thriving
environment where frontline employees felt they had the autonomy to make
a real difference in the organization.3 In other words, to instill a
sense of power in people for sustained engagement, you need the support
of the entire system.</p>
<p>In contrast, overly structured management-driven empowerment programs
that are coupled with continuous improvement initiatives don’t work,
according to researchers from the University of Illinois, as employees
tend to feel such programs are often forced upon them without their
input on the initiatives’ usefulness.4</p>
<p>Instead, the researchers found that even the least powerful employees
will commit to finding ways to make their organization more efficient if
given the autonomy to make decisions and execute the improvement
measures they find most useful. Managers are advised to act more as
coaches, giving direction and support, and trusting that frontline
employees, who are the experts on the ground, know better which
improvements ultimately work in the best interest of the organization.
The study, by Gopesh Anand, Dilip Chhajed, and Luis Delfin, shows that
employees will be most committed to the organization when they feel
their day-to-day work environment is autonomous and when they trust
leaders to have their back. These feelings of power and the reciprocal
trust in leadership in turn lead to proactive behaviors by frontline
employees, as they’re likely to take charge in continuously seeking ways
to improve their daily work practices that lead to organizational
efficiency.</p>
<p>While a companywide effort of making employees feel autonomous and
trusted yields the greatest benefit in employee commitment, managers can
start with their own team members. Encouraging others to share their
unvarnished views on important issues, delegating and sharing
leadership, assigning managerial tasks, communicating frequently, and
allowing for mistakes to serve as learning opportunities can all empower
employees and develop them into independent thinkers who aren’t afraid
to take risks and actively contribute in moving the organization
forward.</p>
<p>It isn’t necessary, or indeed possible, to elevate every member of
staff to a leadership position. But a good manager can offer choices
that lead to empowerment, no title required. While we know that people
instinctively crave higher status, M. Ena Inesi of London Business
School discovered that agency is just as important. She primed study
participants to feel either powerful or powerless. They then had to
choose whether to shop at a nearby store with fewer options, or a store
that was farther away but which offered considerably more options. When
participants felt powerless, they craved more choices. The participants
who felt powerful, however, were content to have fewer choices. “You can
imagine a person at an organization who’s in a low-level job,” Inesi
said at the time.5 “You can make that seemingly powerless person feel
better about their job and their duties by giving them some choice, in
the way they do the work or what project they work on.”</p>
<p>People need to believe they have a sense of control over their
situation, particularly in times of change and uncertainty, or they may
adopt what psychologist Martin Seligman at the University of
Pennsylvania termed “learned helplessness,” where they basically stop
trying. In a similar vein, Harvard psychology professor Ellen Langer
conducted research on mindfulness and choice and found that giving
people choices over their environment actually extended life by years,
according to her studies conducted among the elderly in nursing
homes.</p>
<p>Tom Peters once said, “Leaders don’t create followers; they create
more leaders.” Giving your employees real autonomy and helping them feel
more powerful is not only your best chance to buck the trend of
disengagement and apathy, it is at the heart of competitive
strategy.</p>
