New Managers Can Send the Right Leadership Signals</h4>
<p>By Amy Jen Su</p>
<p>One of the most exciting and sometimes anxiety-producing transitions
in a career comes when you move from being an individual contributor to
becoming a manager. At this juncture, what you think, what you say, and
how you show up—in effect, your leadership presence—can have a direct
impact on those you are now leading and managing for the first time. So,
as a new manager, how do you build an authentic and connected leadership
presence that has a positive impact on your team and colleagues?</p>
<p>Set a leadership values–based goal. An authentic and connected
presence begins from the inside out. How you define the role and what
you value will telegraph out to those you work with. As a new manager,
spend time to consider the kind of leader you are and hope to be. Set an
aspirational goal to serve as a guiding compass. As one new manager
shared recently, “my professional leadership goal is to be a genuine and
emotionally intelligent manager who inspires others to excellence.”</p>
<p>As Ram Charan, Stephen Drotter, and James Noel describe in their
book, The Leadership Pipeline, “Though this might seem like an easy,
natural leadership passage, it’s often one where people trip . . .
[T]hey make the job transition from individual contribution to manager
without making a behavioral or values-based transition . . . They must
believe that making time for others, planning, [and] coaching . . . are
necessary tasks and their responsibility. More than that, they must view
this other-directed work as mission-critical to their success.”</p>
<p>Increase your emotional intelligence and situational awareness. As
the job now shifts to getting more work done through others, recognize
that what motivates or influences you may not be how others are
motivated or influenced. In advance of important interactions or
meetings, ask yourself:</p>
<p>Who is the other person or audience?</p>
<p>What might their perspective on this topic be?</p>
<p>How are they best motivated or influenced?</p>
<p>What does the situation at hand call for?</p>
<p>What are the optimal outcomes and tone?</p>
<p>These questions remind us that leadership presence is not about
finding a one-size-fits-all solution. Leadership presence is therefore
an “and/both” versus an “either/or.” On the one hand, having an
effective leadership presence includes being authentic, genuine, and
clear on your guiding compass, core values, and convictions. And, on the
other hand, it includes being adaptive and agile, demonstrating an
ability to connect with different kinds of people through many different
communication platforms and technologies.</p>
<p>Be clear and direct, always with respect. As your new role will
likely increase your interactions with people of many different styles,
having an effective leadership presence includes continually building
and practicing the skills of being clear and direct while finding ways
of making connections and showing respect. Leadership presence is
dynamic and fluid, and encourages a two-way dialogue where we can give
authentic voice to our views while staying open to the views and
perspectives of others as we work toward a common goal, best outcome, or
solution. Here are a few examples of things that can help you cultivate
your own voice and listen to the voices of others:</p>
<p>Know what you think: If you are naturally strong at listening and
hearing other’s opinions, flex your muscles in getting to your own
convictions and thoughts more quickly. Before important meetings or
interactions, jot down a few bullet points to yourself: What are the
three to five things I believe about this topic or issue?</p>
<p>Ask, listen, and acknowledge: Conversely, if you are naturally strong
at having your own opinions, settle into a greater patience, so that you
can make space to hear others. Show you are really listening by asking
great questions, clarifying what you’ve heard, or acknowledging how
you’re processing the information. In some cases, you might share: “With
this new information, I am experiencing this quite differently. My view
has changed.” In other cases, you might end up saying: “In digesting
what you have shared, I am finding I just can’t get myself comfortable
with that direction. Ultimately, this is coming down to a difference of
opinion.”</p>
<p>Share the “why”: As a new manager, it’s also critical to share the
“why” behind your vision, priorities, expectations, feedback, or
requests. Don’t dilute your message. Instead, make it more powerful by
sharing more about the context. Help connect work deliverables or
professional development to what’s happening at the organizational
level. For example, in giving developmental feedback to someone, you
could include additional context such as: “Because the organization is
growing so fast, there is opportunity for each member of the team to
stretch and step up in the following ways. I’d love to see you take on .
. .” Or, you can strengthen the message by painting the picture of the
aspiration: “I’d love to see us become best in class at this, and here’s
what will be required.”</p>
<p>Bring a stable and grounded presence in the face of change, stress,
or difficult news. The reality is that most of us can exude an effective
presence, especially when business is going well or when we are having a
good day. As a new manager, however, it’s equally important to ask
yourself: What do people experience when I’m stressed out, tired, under
deadline, or when someone is bringing me bad news?</p>
<p>Recognize that what may feel like a passing or fleeting moment of
anger, impatience, or hurried insincerity may end up negatively
impacting your team and its overall morale and engagement. As author
Daniel Goleman writes in his book Primal Leadership: “Quite simply, in
any human group, the leader has maximal power to sway everyone’s
emotions . . . [H]ow well leaders manage their moods affects everyone
else’s moods, which becomes not just a private matter, but a factor in
how well a business will do.”</p>
<p>Maintaining a stable and grounded presence increases the likelihood
that your team will feel comfortable bringing you important information,
even if it’s bad news, so that you can help to remove obstacles, reset
priorities, or get the team back on track. Professor Amy Edmondson’s
research finds that teams can optimize their learning and performance
when there is an environment or culture—most often set by the
manager—that promotes both psychological safety and accountability.</p>
<p>To help maintain and sustain a more stable and grounded presence, be
sure that you are setting the right priorities for yourself, and that
you have strategies for managing the workload of being a leader as you
take on this larger role and responsibility as a new manager.</p>
<p>Becoming a new manager is an important leadership passage in your
career. Step back and think about your leadership presence and if you
are thinking, saying, and showing up as you most hope to and intend. Set
a values-based leadership goal, increase your emotional intelligence and
situational awareness, be direct with respect, and find strategies to
maintain and sustain a stable and grounded presence. It’s easy in our
humbleness to underestimate the impact we have on other’s lives as
managers.</p>
<p>As professor Clayton Christensen writes in his classic HBR article,
“How Will You Measure Your Life?”:</p>
<p>In my mind’s eye I saw one of my managers leave for work one morning
with a relatively strong level of self-esteem. Then, I pictured her
driving home to her family 10 hours later, feeling unappreciated,
frustrated, underutilized, and demeaned. I imagined how profoundly her
lowered self-esteem affected the way she interacted with her children.
The vision in my mind then fast-forwarded to another day, when she drove
home with greater self-esteem—feeling that she had learned a lot, had
been recognized for achieving valuable things, and had played a
significant role in the success of some important initiatives. I then
imagined how positively that affected her as a spouse and a parent. My
conclusion: Management is the most noble of professions if it’s
practiced well. No other occupation offers as many ways to help others
learn and grow, take responsibility, be recognized for achievement, and
contribute to the success of a team.</p>
