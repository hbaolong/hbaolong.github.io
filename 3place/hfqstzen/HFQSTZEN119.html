<h4 id="dont-let-power-corrupt-you">1 Don’t Let Power Corrupt You</h4>
<p>By Dacher Keltner</p>
<p>In the behavioral research I’ve conducted over the past 20 years,
I’ve uncovered a disturbing pattern: While people usually gain power
through traits and actions that advance the interests of others, such as
empathy, collaboration, openness, fairness, and sharing, when they start
to feel powerful or enjoy a position of privilege, those qualities begin
to fade. The powerful are more likely than other people to engage in
rude, selfish, and unethical behavior. The 19th-century historian and
politician Lord Acton got it right: Power does tend to corrupt.</p>
<p>I call this phenomenon “the power paradox,” and I’ve studied it in
numerous settings: colleges, the U.S. Senate, pro sports teams, and a
variety of other professional workplaces. In each I’ve observed that
people rise on the basis of their good qualities, but their behavior
grows increasingly worse as they move up the ladder. This shift can
happen surprisingly quickly. In one of my experiments, known as “the
cookie monster” study, I brought people into a lab in groups of three,
randomly assigned one to a position of leadership, and then gave them a
group writing task. A half hour into their work, I placed a plate of
freshly baked cookies—one for each team member, plus an extra—in front
of every one. In all groups each person took one and, out of politeness,
left the extra cookie. The question was: Who would take a second treat,
knowing that it would deprive others of the same? It was nearly always
the person who’d been named the leader. In addition, the leaders were
more likely to eat with their mouths open, lips smacking, and crumbs
falling onto their clothes.</p>
<p>Studies show that wealth and credentials can have a similar effect.
In another experiment, Paul Piff of UC Irvine and I found that whereas
drivers of the least expensive vehicles—Dodge Colts, Plymouth
Satellites—always ceded the right-of-way to pedestrians in a crosswalk,
people driving luxury cars such as BMWs and Mercedes yielded only 54% of
the time; nearly half the time they ignored the pedestrian and the law.
Surveys of employees in 27 countries have revealed that wealthy
individuals are more likely to say it’s acceptable to engage in
unethical behavior, such as taking bribes or cheating on taxes. And
recent research led by Danny Miller at HEC Montréal demonstrated that
CEOs with MBAs are more likely than those without MBAs to engage in
self-serving behavior that increases their personal compensation but
causes their companies’ value to decline.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that iconic abuses of power—Jeffrey Skilling’s
fraudulent accounting at Enron, Tyco CEO Dennis Kozlowski’s illegal
bonuses, Silvio Berlusconi’s bunga bunga parties, Leona Helmsley’s tax
evasion—are extreme examples of the kinds of misbehavior to which all
leaders, at any level, are susceptible. Studies show that people in
positions of corporate power are three times as likely as those at the
lower rungs of the ladder to interrupt co workers, multitask during
meetings, raise their voices, and say insulting things at the office.
And people who’ve just moved into senior roles are particularly
vulnerable to losing their virtues, my research and other studies
indicate.</p>
<p>The consequences can be far-reaching. The abuse of power ultimately
tarnishes the reputations of executives, undermining their opportunities
for influence. It also creates stress and anxiety among their
colleagues, diminishing rigor and creativity in the group and dragging
down team members’ engagement and performance. In a recent poll of 800
managers and employees in 17 industries, about half the respondents who
reported being treated rudely at work said they deliberately decreased
their effort or lowered the quality of their work in response.</p>
<p>So how can you avoid succumbing to the power paradox? Through
awareness and action.</p>
<p>A need for reflection</p>
<p>A first step is developing greater self-awareness. When you take on a
senior role, you need to be attentive to the feelings that accompany
your newfound power and to any changes in your behavior. My research has
shown that power puts us into something like a manic state, making us
feel expansive, energized, omnipotent, hungry for rewards, and immune to
risk—which opens us up to rash, rude, and unethical actions. But new
studies in neuroscience find that simply by reflecting on those thoughts
and emotions—“Hey, I’m feeling as if I should rule the world right
now”—we can engage regions of our frontal lobes that help us keep our
worst impulses in check. When we recognize and label feelings of joy and
confidence, we’re less likely to make irrational decisions inspired by
them. When we acknowledge feelings of frustration (perhaps because
subordinates aren’t behaving the way we want), we’re less likely to
respond in adversarial or confrontational ways.</p>
<p>You can build this kind of self-awareness through everyday
mindfulness practices. One approach starts with sitting in a comfortable
and quiet place, breathing deeply, and concentrating on the feeling of
inhaling and exhaling, physical sensations, or sounds or sights in your
environment. Studies show that spending just a few minutes a day on such
exercises gives people greater focus and calm, and for that reason
techniques for them are now taught in training programs at companies
like Google, Facebook, Aetna, General Mills, Ford, and Goldman
Sachs.</p>
<p>It’s also important to reflect on your demeanor and actions. Are you
interrupting people? Do you check your phone when others are talking?
Have you told a joke or story that embarrassed or humiliated someone
else? Do you swear at the office? Have you ever taken sole credit for a
group effort? Do you forget colleagues’ names? Are you spending a lot
more money than in the past or taking unusual physical risks?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to at least a few of these questions, take it as
an early warning sign that you’re being tempted into problematic,
arrogant displays of power. What may seem innocuous to you probably
doesn’t to your subordinates. Consider a story I recently heard about a
needlessly hierarchical lunch delivery protocol on a cable television
writing team. Each day when the team’s sandwiches arrived, they were
doled out to the writers in order of seniority. In failing to correct
this behavior, the group’s leaders were almost certainly diminishing its
collaborative and creative potential. For a contrast, consider U.S.
military mess halls, where the practice is the reverse, as the
ethnographer and author Simon Sinek notes in the title of his book,
Leaders Eat Last. Officers adhere to the policy not to cede authority
but to show respect for their troops.</p>
<p>Practicing graciousness</p>
<p>Whether you’ve already begun to succumb to the power paradox or not,
you must work to remember and repeat the virtuous behaviors that helped
you rise in the first place. When teaching executives and others in
positions of power, I focus on three essential practices—empathy,
gratitude, and generosity—that have been shown to sustain benevolent
leadership, even in the most cutthroat environments.</p>
<p>For example, Leanne ten Brinke, Chris Liu, Sameer Srivastava, and I
found that U.S. senators who used empathetic facial expressions and
tones of voice when speaking to the floor got more bills passed than
those who used domineering, threatening gestures and tones in their
speeches. Research by Anita Woolley of Carnegie Mellon and Thomas Malone
of MIT has likewise shown that when teammates subtly signal
understanding, engagement, interest, and concern for one another, the
team is more effective at tackling hard analytical problems.</p>
<p>Small expressions of gratitude also yield positive results. Studies
show that romantic partners who acknowledge each other’s value in casual
conversation are less likely to break up, that students who receive a
pat on the back from their teachers are more likely to take on difficult
problems, and that people who express appreciation to others in a newly
formed group feel stronger ties to the group months later. Adam Grant of
Wharton has found that when managers take the time to thank their
employees, those workers are more engaged and productive. And my own
research on NBA teams with Michael Kraus of Yale University shows that
players who physically display their appreciation—through head raps,
bear hugs, and hip and chest bumps—inspire their teammates to play
better and win nearly two more games per season (which is both
statistically significant and often the difference between making the
playoffs and not).</p>
<p>Simple acts of generosity can be equally powerful. Studies show that
individuals who share with others in a group—for example, by
contributing new ideas or directly assisting on projects not their
own—are deemed more worthy of respect and influence and more suitable
for leadership. Mike Norton at Harvard Business School has found that
when organizations provide an opportunity to donate to charities at
work, employees feel more satisfied and productive.</p>
<p>It might seem difficult to constantly follow the ethics of “good
power” when you’re the boss and responsible for making sure things get
done. Not so. Your capacity for empathy, gratitude, and generosity can
be cultivated by engaging in simple social behaviors whenever the
opportunity presents itself: a team meeting, a client pitch or
negotiation, a 360-degree feedback session. Here are a few
suggestions.</p>
<p>To practice empathy:</p>
<p>Ask a great question or two in every interaction, and paraphrase
important points that others make.</p>
<p>Listen with gusto. Orient your body and eyes toward the person
speaking, and convey interest and engagement vocally.</p>
<p>When someone comes to you with a problem, signal concern with phrases
such as “I’m sorry” and “That’s really tough.” Avoid rushing to judgment
and advice.</p>
<p>Before meetings, take a moment to think about the person you’ll be
with and what is happening in his or her life.</p>
<p>Arturo Bejar, Facebook’s director of engineering, is one executive
I’ve seen make empathy a priority as he guides his teams of designers,
coders, data specialists, and writers. Watching him at work, I’ve
noticed that his meetings all tend to be structured around a cascade of
open-ended questions and that he never fails to listen thoughtfully. He
leans toward whoever is speaking and carefully writes down every one’s
ideas on a notepad. These small expressions of empathy signal to his
team that he understands their concerns and wants them to succeed
together.</p>
<p>To practice gratitude:</p>
<p>Make thoughtful thank-yous a part of how you communicate with
others.</p>
<p>Send colleagues specific and timely emails or notes of appreciation
for jobs done well.</p>
<p>Publicly acknowledge the value that each person contributes to your
team, including the support staff.</p>
<p>Use the right kind of touch—pats on the back, fist bumps, or high
fives—to celebrate successes.</p>
<p>When Douglas Conant was CEO of the Campbell Soup Company, he
emphasized a culture of gratitude across the organization. Each day he
and his executive assistants would spend up to an hour scanning his
email and the company intranet for news of employees who were “making a
difference.” Conant would then personally thank them—every one from
senior executives to maintenance people—for their contributions, usually
with handwritten notes. He estimates that he wrote at least 10 a day,
for a total of about 30,000 during his decade-long tenure, and says he
would often find them pinned up in employees’ workspaces. Leaders I’ve
taught have shared other tactics: giving small gifts to employees,
taking them out to nice lunches or dinners, hosting
employee-of-the-month celebrations, and setting up real or virtual
“gratitude walls,” on which coworkers can thank one another for specific
contributions.</p>
<p>To practice generosity:</p>
<p>Seek opportunities to spend a little one-on-one time with the people
you lead.</p>
<p>Delegate some important and high-profile responsibilities.</p>
<p>Give praise generously.</p>
<p>Share the limelight. Give credit to all who contribute to the success
of your team and your organization.</p>
<p>Pixar director Pete Docter is a master of this last practice. When I
first started working with him on the movie Inside Out, I was curious
about a cinematic marvel he’d created five years before: the montage at
the start of the film Up, which shows the protagonist, Carl, meeting and
falling in love with a girl, Ellie; enjoying a long married life with
her; and then watching her succumb to illness. When I asked how he’d
accomplished it, his answer was an exhaustive list of the 250 writers,
animators, actors, story artists, designers, sculptors, editors,
programmers, and computer modelers who had worked on it with him. When
people ask about the box-office success of Inside Out, he gives a
similar response. Another Facebook executive I’ve worked with, product
manager Kelly Winters, shares credit in a similar way. When she does
PowerPoint presentations or talks to reporters about the success of her
Compassion team, she always lists or talks about the data analysts,
engineers, and content specialists who made it happen.</p>
<hr />
<p>You can outsmart the power paradox by practicing the ethics of
empathy, gratitude, and generosity. It will bring out the best work and
collaborative spirit of those around you. And you, too, will benefit,
with a burnished reputation, long-lasting leadership, and the
dopamine-rich delights of advancing the interests of others.</p>

California, Berkeley, and the faculty director of the Greater Good
Science Center. He is also the author of The Power Paradox: How We Gain
and Lose Influence.</p>
