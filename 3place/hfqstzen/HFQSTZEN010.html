<h4 id="there-are-risks-to-mindfulness-at-work">9 There Are Risks to
Mindfulness at Work</h4>
<p>By David Brendel</p>
<p>Mindfulness is close to taking on cult status in the business world.
But as with any rapidly growing movement—regardless of its potential
benefits—there is good reason here for caution.</p>
<p>Championed for many years by pioneering researchers such as Ellen
Langer and Jon Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness is a mental orientation and set
of strategies for focusing one’s mind on here-and-now experiences, such
as abdominal muscle movements during respiration or the chirping of
birds outside one’s window. It is rooted in ancient Eastern
philosophies, such as Taoism and Buddhism. Contemporary empirical
research demonstrates its benefits for reducing anxiety and mental
stress.1 A recent study suggested that it might cut the risk of stroke
and heart attack as well.</p>
<p>Mindful meditation and related practices are now widely accepted. For
example, the New Republic published an article entitled “How 2014 Became
the Year of Mindfulness.” Mindfulness has also recently been featured on
CBS’s 60 Minutes and been lauded by the Huffington Post. Dan Harris, a
well-known ABC News correspondent, has published a best-selling book
called Ten Percent Happier, which describes his journey to discovering
mindful meditation as an optimal way to manage his very publicly shared
anxiety disorder. There is increasing interest in how mindfulness can be
applied in clinical medicine and psychology, and some large insurance
companies are even beginning to consider providing coverage for
mindfulness strategies for certain patients.</p>
<p>As an executive coach and physician, I often sing the praises of
mindfulness practices and recommend them to clients to manage stress,
avoid burnout, enhance leadership capacity, and steady the mind when in
the midst of making important business decisions, career transitions,
and personal life changes. Drawing on concepts from Eastern philosophies
and research evidence from contemporary neuroscience, I help some
clients employ controlled breathing and similar strategies in our
sessions and in their everyday lives.2 I also refer clients to trusted
colleagues who teach yoga and mindful meditation in greater depth than I
can provide in my coaching sessions.</p>
<p>But my growing knowledge of (and enthusiasm for) mindfulness is now
tempered by a concern about its potential excesses and the risk that it
may be crowding out other equally important models and strategies for
managing stress, achieving peak performance, and reaching professional
and personal fulfillment. At times, it appears that we are witnessing
the development of a “cult of mindfulness” that, if not appropriately
recognized and moderated, may result in an unfortunate backlash against
it. Here are a couple of my concerns.</p>
<p>The avoidance risk</p>
<p>Some people use mindfulness strategies to avoid critical thinking
tasks. I’ve worked with clients who, instead of rationally thinking
through a career challenge or ethical dilemma, prefer to disconnect from
their challenges and retreat into a meditative mindset. The issue here
is that some problems require more thinking, not less. Sometimes stress
is a signal that we need to consider our circumstances through greater
self-reflective thought, not a “mindful” retreat to focused breathing or
other immediate sensory experiences. Mindfulness strategies can prime
the mind for sounder rational thinking—but the former clearly should not
displace the latter. One of my clients spent so much time meditating and
“mindfully” accepting her life “on its own terms” that she failed to
confront underperforming workers (and discipline or fire the worst
offenders) in her company. After periods of meditating, she struggled to
return to focused, task-oriented thinking. She required significant
reminders and reassurance from me that embracing Buddhist meditation
does not entail tolerating substandard performance from her employees.
Mindful meditation should always be used in the service of enhancing,
not displacing, people’s rational and analytical thought processes about
their careers and personal lives.</p>
<p>The groupthink risk</p>
<p>As mindfulness practices enter mainstream American life, some
organizations and companies are admirably encouraging their people to
make use of them in the workplace.3 But I’m aware of situations where
this new orientation has gone too far. In one case, the director of a
business unit in a financial services corporation required his direct
reports to participate several times per week in a 10- to 15-minute
mindfulness session that involved controlled breathing and guided
imagery. Many participants came to dread the exercise. Some of them felt
extremely awkward and uncomfortable, believing that mindfulness
practices should be done in private. The very exercise that was supposed
to reduce their work-related stress actually had increased it. The
practice continued for weeks until several members of the group finally
gathered the courage to tell the group leader that they would strongly
prefer the daily exercises be optional, with impunity for
nonparticipants. Mindfulness is rooted in a philosophy and psychology of
self-efficacy and proactive self-care. Imposing it on people in a
top-down manner degrades the practice and the people who might benefit
from using it of their own volition.</p>
<p>That mindfulness has emerged as a major cultural phenomenon on the
contemporary American scene and in the business world in particular can
be good news for people dealing with stress, burnout, and other
realities of the modern workplace. But mindfulness practices need to be
incorporated as one among many self-chosen strategies for people aiming
to cope with stress, think effectively, make sound decisions, and
achieve fulfillment. Mindfulness practices should be used to enhance our
rational and ethical thinking processes, not limit or displace them. And
mindfulness practices should never be imposed on people, especially in
the workplace. At its very core, mindfulness will be a huge step forward
for Western culture if it stays focused on creating opportunities for
individuals to discover their own personalized strategies for taming
anxieties, managing stress, optimizing work performance, and reaching
happiness and fulfillment.</p>
