<h4 id="do-you-hate-your-boss">8 Do You Hate Your Boss?</h4>
<p>By Manfred F. R. Kets de Vries</p>
<p>Stacey really loved her job at a top tech company—that is, until her
boss left for another firm. The new manager, Peter, seemed to dislike
pretty much everyone on the team he had inherited, regardless of
individual or collective performance. He was aloof, prone to
micromanaging, and apt to write off any project that wasn’t his
brainchild. Within a year he had replaced a number of Stacey’s
colleagues.</p>
<p>At first Stacey (whose name, like others in this article, has been
changed to protect her confidentiality) tried to win her new boss’s
trust and respect by asking for his feedback and guidance. But Peter was
unresponsive. Despite her best efforts, Stacey couldn’t make the
relationship click. When, several months in, she finally decided to
approach HR about the problem, she got nothing more than sympathy. The
firm was not willing to sanction Peter, because his unit’s performance
had not materially deteriorated and no one else had lodged a
complaint.</p>
<p>Unable to escape or change the dynamic with Peter, Stacey felt
stressed, depressed, and increasingly unable to do good work. She
worried that the only way out was to leave the company she loved.</p>
<p>Stacey’s situation is not uncommon. According to the most recent
Gallup State of the Global Workplace study, half of all employees in the
United States have quit jobs at some point in their career in order to
get away from their bosses. The figures are similar or even higher for
workers in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.1</p>
<p>The same survey, consistent with previous ones, also shows a clear
correlation between an employee’s engagement (that is, motivation and
effort to achieve organizational goals) and his or her relationship with
the boss. While 77% of employees who said they were engaged at work
described interactions with their managers in positive terms (for
example, “my supervisor focuses on my strengths”), only 23% of those who
were “not engaged” and a mere 4% of those who were “actively disengaged”
did the same. This is worrying, because research has shown that an
engaged workforce is a key driver of organizational success. And yet
according to Gallup, only 13% of employees worldwide fall into that
category.</p>
<p>What are the “bad” bosses doing? Frequently cited grievances include
micromanaging, bullying, avoiding conflict, ducking decisions, stealing
credit, shifting blame, hoarding information, failing to listen, setting
a poor example, slacking, and not developing staff. Such dysfunctional
behavior would make anyone unhappy and unproductive. However, whatever
sins your boss commits, managing your relationship with them is a
critical part of your job. Doing it well is a key indicator of how
effective you are.</p>
<p>In my work as a researcher, management coach, and psychoanalyst, I
have spent many decades working with senior and high-potential
executives to help them resolve dysfunctional dynamics with their
managers. This article explores the options available to anyone in the
same predicament. Much of it will feel like common sense. But I have
found that people often forget that it’s in their power to improve bad
situations, so having the options systematically laid out can be very
helpful.</p>
<p>Practice empathy</p>
<p>The first step is to consider the external pressures your manager is
under. Remember, most bad bosses are not inherently bad people; they’re
good people with weaknesses that can be exacerbated by the pressure to
lead and deliver results. So it’s important to consider not just how
they act but why they’re acting that way.</p>
<p>Research has shown time and again that practicing empathy can be a
game changer in difficult boss-subordinate relationships and not just as
a top-down phenomenon. Experts such as Stephen Covey and Daniel Goleman
emphasize the importance of using this key aspect of emotional
intelligence to manage up. Neuroscience also suggests that it’s an
effective strategy, since mirror neurons in the human brain naturally
prompt people to reciprocate behaviors. Bottom line: If you work on
empathizing with your boss, chances are they will start empathizing with
you, and that will benefit everyone.</p>
<p>It may seem difficult to feel for a manager who isn’t giving you what
you need or whom you actively dislike. But as Goleman showed years ago,
empathy can be learned. And recent research from other scholars,
including experts at the Menninger Clinic, suggests that if you practice
empathy consciously, your perceptions of others’ feelings will be more
accurate.2</p>
<p>I recall the case of George, a sales manager in a big U.S. firm, who
had been going out of his way to please his boss, Abby—to no avail.
George was extremely frustrated by Abby’s lack of attention and support
until a colleague told him to imagine being in the boss’s shoes. George
knew that Abby’s own manager was a real taskmaster, famous for setting
impossible stretch goals. Once George took that into account, he
realized that Abby was not deliberately ignoring him; she simply didn’t
have time to be supportive, as she was working on several important new
business initiatives at once.</p>
<p>Although it may be a conscious exercise, a display of empathy is
still best delivered in an informal setting. You don’t make an
appointment; instead you look for the right moment when the other person
will be receptive to your efforts. In George’s case it came on a shared
business trip to some high-profile accounts in Singapore. Over dinner
the first day, he carefully offered Abby an opportunity to open up about
the pressures she felt by asking how the new business projects in
mainland China were coming along.</p>
<p>Abby turned out to be only too ready to share her stresses and
frustrations, and the exchange marked a turning point in what eventually
became a very satisfactory working relationship between the two. George
worried less about the attention he was (or wasn’t) getting, and Abby
seemed readier to listen to his problems.</p>
<p>Consider your role</p>
<p>The second step is to look at yourself. In my experience, people who
struggle to work well with their bosses are nearly always part of the
problem themselves: Their behavior is in some way preventing them from
being recognized and valued. This probably isn’t what you want to hear,
but by acknowledging that you might be doing something wrong, figuring
out what it is, and adjusting accordingly, you might be able to salvage
the relationship.</p>
<p>Start with some introspection. Consider, as objectively as you can,
any criticisms your boss has offered. In what areas do you need to
improve? What aspects of your behavior or output might irk him or
her?</p>
<p>Also ask yourself what might make your personalities clash. I often
find after a fairly short discussion with clients that their managers
are “transferential figures,” representing authority figures from the
past with whom the clients have unresolved issues. Transference of this
kind has a powerful influence on behavior and should always be
explicitly considered in figuring out dysfunctions in any
boss-subordinate relationship.</p>
<p>One client, for example, told me that her boss reminded her of a
primary school teacher who had bullied her and whom she had never been
able to please. The two resembled each other physically and shared a
similar peremptory manner of communicating.</p>
<p>When we surface transference, we can usually take steps to correct
for it. After our sessions, my client reported that she found it easier
to step back and separate her past resentments from her present
reactions and view her boss’s comments in a positive light.</p>
<p>Next, observe and seek advice from colleagues who work successfully
with your boss. Try to understand the boss’s preferences, quirks, and
hot buttons, and get some pointers on how you might do things
differently. When you approach colleagues, though, make sure to frame
any questions carefully. For instance, instead of asking a coworker why
the boss always interrupts you when you speak, ask the person, “How do
you know whether to speak up or not? How can you tell when the boss does
or doesn’t want input? How do you express disagreement?”</p>
<p>Also take advantage of group training programs to get advice from
peers. I remember the case of Tom, who, during a leadership development
workshop was asked (like everyone else in his small group) to present an
issue that was troubling him. He confessed that he needed to improve his
relationship with his boss; whatever he did, it never seemed good
enough. His peers were frank in their responses. They said that he often
sounded muddled in meetings when trying to explain his business unit
goals and that he seemed to be doing a poor job of empowering his direct
reports. In the view of his colleagues, this was why the boss was
dissatisfied with Tom’s performance.</p>
<p>They suggested he spend more time rehearsing and framing his
presentations and, in particular, work on proposing less-generic goals
and identifying measures of success. They also recommended that he have
his subordinates copresent with him and make reports on their own. Tom
asked a few clarifying questions and left the workshop eager to apply
the advice he’d received. At the next year’s planning session, his boss
congratulated him on the quality of his group’s presentation and
followed up with an email praising the teamwork his unit was starting to
display.</p>
<p>If feedback from your colleagues doesn’t provide any insights into
how your behavior might be hurting you, the next step is to try talking
to your boss about the problem. Again, approach the conversation
delicately, framing your questions in a positive way: “How can I better
help you achieve your goals?” rather than “What am I doing wrong?”
Position yourself as seeking advice or even mentoring. Request a
one-on-one meeting to do this, and give your boss an idea of what you’d
like to discuss: performance issues and the development of your
management skills.</p>
<p>If you’re lucky, he or she will appreciate your willingness to engage
and will point out areas to improve, building the foundation for a
closer relationship. If your boss stonewalls or rebuffs you, however,
that’s a clue that the problem isn’t you, and you need to figure out
what—if anything—you can do to alter things.</p>
<p>Offer a chance to change</p>
<p>If you conclude you’re not the one derailing the relationship with
your boss, only then should you openly suggest that the two of you don’t
seem to interact well and that you’d like to remedy the situation.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways into this conversation. If you have the
opportunity, you can tack it on as an extension of a frank discussion
you’re already having. Jeanne, a French executive I once taught, told me
about a visit she’d made with her British boss, Richard, to meet a
customer. The client gave them both an extremely rough ride, which
prompted an exchange between the two of them about what had gone wrong.
This gave Jeanne an opening to express some of her frustrations with her
boss’s behavior, and the two were able to work out how they could
improve their own relationship.</p>
<p>If a moment like this does not present itself, you have to initiate
the conversation yourself. Most conflict management experts recommend
doing that in a private setting where you can’t easily be interrupted
and where it will be difficult for either of you to leave. To have a
constructive talk, it’s important that people feel they are in a safe
place. Invite your boss out to lunch, perhaps, at a restaurant where you
are unlikely to meet colleagues. Explain that you have some private
concerns you want to discuss away from the office. If a specific
business problem, such as the failure to meet a crucial deadline, came
about because of the friction between you, you can say you wish to talk
about this event and its implications for other projects—the kind of
postmortem that Jeanne and Richard had. Let your boss know to expect a
difficult conversation—one that can’t be sidestepped. If you just say
you want to discuss interpersonal issues, the boss may find some crisis
that takes priority.</p>
<p>When you begin a dialogue, you may even discover that your boss is
not consciously aware of the degree of your discontent. With Jeanne, for
example, one problem was that Richard never asked her for an opinion,
listening only to colleagues (also largely British and male) who
volunteered their ideas. When they talked about it, Richard explained
that he didn’t want to put her on the spot in meetings but he had no
intention of silencing her.</p>
<p>Organize a mutiny</p>
<p>If you can’t improve things by changing your behavior or opening
lines of communication with your boss, and if your colleagues feel the
same way you do, you should consider alerting HR and the boss’s bosses
to the problem.</p>
<p>In taking this route, however, you need to make a substantial
business case for why your boss is a liability, someone whose poor
management will ultimately cause the team’s, unit’s, or organization’s
performance to suffer. You must also be prepared to make a credible
threat of litigation against the corporation. You’ll need documented
evidence of the boss’s negative impact and inappropriate behavior, such
as witness statements and examples of correspondence that clearly breach
company rules or HR guidelines. The more people willing to go on record
with similar complaints and evidence, the harder it will be for senior
managers to ignore or deny the problem.</p>
<p>In the absence of compelling data indicating a pattern of bad
behavior, HR representatives are unlikely to be allies; very often they
will take the boss’s side. Maria, another executive I counseled who had
had issues with her boss, initially went to HR for help. But her boss
was extremely skilled at self-promotion and persuaded HR that in fact
Maria was the problem. The head of HR not only declined to pursue the
matter but even suggested that it was up to Maria to adapt to her
boss.</p>
<p>Stories like that are all too common, and many subordinates who have
not prepared a strong case against the boss have ended up losing their
jobs rather than forcing a change of behavior or practice. Mutiny and
whistle-blowing can also damage your future job prospects. Lodging a
formal complaint, therefore, should definitely be a last resort.</p>
<p>Play for time or move on</p>
<p>If you are unable to change your relationship with your boss by
taking the steps described here, and if there isn’t potential for group
action, then your options become more limited.</p>
<p>In these situations, most employees simply go through the motions at
work and minimize contact with the boss. There is always the
possibility, or hope, that he or she will move on. But remember that in
playing for time, you also need to set a time limit, so that hanging in
doesn’t become a way of life. If it does, you will feel disengaged,
disenchanted, and even embittered. And that may spill over to other
realms, contributing to depression and a range of additional
psychosomatic reactions.</p>
<p>The better solution is to look for another job while you’re still
employed, exiting on your own terms. Beef up your résumé, contact
headhunters, line up references, and start interviewing. Having a bad
boss isn’t your fault, but staying with one will be.</p>
<p>That’s ultimately what Stacey concluded. After some soul-searching,
she started to hunt for another job. It didn’t take her long to find an
interesting position in another organization working under a boss with
whom she had great rapport. Some months later a former colleague told
Stacey that Peter had left the company soon after her. Although his
departure was announced as his own choice, the inside scoop was that top
management had forced him out because he was losing too many valuable
people.</p>
