Ace Your Job Interview, Get into Character and Rehearse</h4>
<p>By Cathy Salit</p>
<p>You’ve landed an interview for the job of your dreams. You’re ideally
suited for the position, and your resume is bulletproof. You’ve
researched the company, the culture, the job, and the person who will be
interviewing you. (Thank you, LinkedIn.) You’ve got your answers ready
and selling points lined up. But when the interview starts, something’s
“off.” You want to be commanding, but your nervousness gets in the way.
Your voice sounds stiff. You hear yourself trying too hard, but you
can’t seem to stop yourself. As the minutes tick by, your answers sound
more and more like canned monologues. And your interviewer isn’t warming
up—the job opportunity is slipping, slipping, slipping out of reach.</p>
<p>What went wrong?</p>
<p>As I see it, you probably prepared your content well, but—like many
people—you didn’t prepare something equally, if not more important: your
performance. Yes, performance, the theatrical kind. Just as an actor
prepares the character they will play on stage or screen, you can steal
some tricks from the actor’s toolbox to prepare the character you will
play in the interview. For this kind of scene, you’ll need to exude
confidence, competence, likability, flexibility, and more. How to do
this in a high-stakes situation? Tap into your natural ability to
imagine and pretend—and craft your character.</p>
<p>“But wait a minute,” you say. “Character? Pretend? What about being
my authentic self?”</p>
<p>I get asked about that a lot, and it’s a good question—many job
coaches and experts extol authenticity, values-based behavior, and being
“genuine” at work.</p>
<p>My company’s own two decades of practice and research have focused on
what we call the “Becoming Principle,” in which the tools of theatrical
performance give us the transformative power to become who we are not .
. . yet. When we consciously use our capacity to pretend and perform, we
can grow new—and genuine—parts of ourselves. (The Latin verb in the word
pretend is tendere, literally to stretch, not to fake or wear a mask.)
This idea resonates with the findings of Herminia Ibarra in her landmark
HBR article, “The Authenticity Paradox.” Ibarra writes that our
adherence to one “true self” can hold us back as we take on new
challenges and bigger roles. In other words, by sticking to “your
story,” you’re limiting yourself.</p>
<p>In the job interview, you are literally auditioning for a new role.
Developing your skills as a performer will help you not only to land the
job, it will also help you grow and gain a new skill that is critical in
the 21st-century workplace—navigating constant change that requires
flexibility and new performances all the time.</p>
<p>Who do you want to be in this scene? That’s where your “job interview
character” comes in. Make a list of the qualities the successful
candidate should convey. To some extent, these qualities will depend on
the particular job you are applying for—a software engineer and a sales
director will need to emphasize different leading attributes. And you’ll
want to convey in your performance that you have a feel for the
company’s culture—a laid-back dude vibe could be a turn-off in a formal
environment, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Skilled interviewers will often be looking for the qualities that are
known to correlate with success on the job, such as confidence, energy,
and positive body language. How to physically act out these personal
qualities? Much has been written about the body language of confidence
and how specific gestures such as physical stance, tone, handshake, and
eye contact instantly communicate both ease and authority. If you are
not sure how to portray these qualities, look for others who seem to
embody them, then observe, closely, how they do it. You’re not looking
to slavishly copy, but rather creatively imitate them. Try it on, try it
out, and see what works for you.</p>
<p>Most important—rehearse! Like any good performer, you need to
practice in advance. If you tend to be shy, expand your range of
expression (and what you’re comfortable doing) by practicing what might
feel like an exaggerated performance, using hand gestures and passion.
If you talk a lot using run-on sentences with no period at the end (a
lot of us do this when we’re nervous), practice pausing and breaking
your thoughts into short sentences.</p>
<p>Even with practice and rehearsal, we can get overloaded and stressed
in new situations, particularly when we’re the center of attention and
under scrutiny. That’s why I suggest that—in addition to those outlined
above—your job interview character have a special trait: Instead of
performing as a person who is trying really hard to get the job, perform
as someone who wants to have a great conversation with the human being
across from you.</p>
<p>Your mindset is more like I’ve done some cool and interesting things
in my life and work that I’d love to share, and I’m really interested to
hear about you and your company. In other words, you’ll play the role of
a good conversationalist. Here’s how:</p>
<p>Be curious. Most people talk too much during an interview. Instead,
perform curiosity—ask open-ended (not yes or no) questions that are
connected to what you just heard. This will help you discover common
ground with your interviewer, which is key to making a great first
impression.</p>
<p>Accept every conversational offer. Of course you need to prepare
“talking points” for your interview. But being in a conversation
(instead of delivering a rehearsed pitch) means creating back-and-forth
repartee. That means you can do what improvisers do, and treat
everything the interviewer says or does as an “offer”—which you should
accept and build upon (rather than waiting for them to finish so that
you can fire off another talking point). You can practice this kind of
listening today, by starting every sentence with the words “yes, and . .
.” Improv skills are now highly valued in the workplace. And in an
interview, this fundamental improv technique will make you less focused
on proving yourself and much more attuned to the other person.</p>
<p>Prepare to tell stories. This may be one of the most powerful
elements of a great conversationalist performance. The ancient art of
storytelling has a powerful effect on stirring empathic emotions and
boosting your own likeability. Prepare and practice yours in advance so
that when the interviewer asks if you’re experienced in leading
projects, you can tell the story in a way that dramatizes the most
recent project you led. Describe how the project began, what you did,
the obstacles you faced and how you overcame them. Good stories have a
beginning, middle, and end. Make them short, but pack a punch.</p>
<p>Some of these techniques won’t feel like “you”—and that’s the point.
By making use of your natural ability to perform in new ways, you’re
expanding your comfort zone and increasing your repertoire of what feels
natural. This is how you grow. It’s how you become who you are not yet.
It’s also how you get the job.</p>
