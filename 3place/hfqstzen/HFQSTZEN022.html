People</h4>
<p>An interview with Robert McKee by Bronwyn Fryer</p>
<p>Persuasion is the centerpiece of business activity. Customers must be
convinced to buy your company’s products or services, employees and
colleagues to go along with a new strategic plan or reorganization,
investors to buy (or not to sell) your stock, and partners to sign the
next deal. But despite the critical importance of persuasion, most
executives struggle to communicate, let alone inspire. Too often, they
get lost in the accoutrements of company-speak: PowerPoint slides, dry
memos, and hyperbolic missives from the corporate communications
department. Even the most carefully researched and considered efforts
are routinely greeted with cynicism, lassitude, or outright
dismissal.</p>
<p>Why is persuasion so difficult, and what can you do to set people on
fire? In search of answers to those questions, HBR senior editor Bronwyn
Fryer paid a visit to Robert McKee, the world’s best known and most
respected screenwriting lecturer, at his home in Los Angeles. An
award-winning writer and director, McKee moved to California after
studying for his PhD in cinema arts at the University of Michigan. He
then taught at the University of Southern California’s School of Cinema
and Television before forming his own company, Two Arts, to take his
lectures on the art of storytelling worldwide to an audience of writers,
directors, producers, actors, and entertainment executives.</p>
<p>McKee’s students have written, directed, and produced hundreds of hit
films, including Forrest Gump, Erin Brockovich, The Color Purple,
Gandhi, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Sleepless in Seattle, Toy
Story, and Nixon. They have won 18 Academy Awards, 109 Emmy Awards, 19
Writers Guild Awards, and 16 Directors Guild of America Awards. Emmy
Award winner Brian Cox portrays McKee in the 2002 film Adaptation, which
follows the life of a screenwriter trying to adapt the book The Orchid
Thief. McKee also serves as a project consultant to film and television
production companies such as Disney, Pixar, and Paramount as well as
major corporations (including Microsoft) that regularly send their
entire creative staffs to his lectures.</p>
<p>McKee believes that executives can engage listeners on a whole new
level if they toss their PowerPoint slides and learn to tell good
stories instead. In his best-selling book Story: Substance, Structure,
Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting, published in 1997 by
HarperCollins, McKee argues that stories “fulfill a profound human need
to grasp the patterns of living—not merely as an intellectual exercise,
but within a very personal, emotional experience.” What follows is an
edited and abridged transcript of McKee’s conversation with HBR.</p>
<p>Why should a CEO or a manager pay attention to a screenwriter?</p>
<p>A big part of a CEO’s job is to motivate people to reach certain
goals. To do that, he or she must engage their emotions, and the key to
their hearts is story. There are two ways to persuade people. The first
is by using conventional rhetoric, which is what most executives are
trained in. It’s an intellectual process, and in the business world it
usually consists of a PowerPoint slide presentation in which you say,
“Here is our company’s biggest challenge, and here is what we need to do
to prosper.” And you build your case by giving statistics and facts and
quotes from authorities. But there are two problems with rhetoric.
First, the people you’re talking to have their own set of authorities,
statistics, and experiences. While you’re trying to persuade them, they
are arguing with you in their heads. Second, if you do succeed in
persuading them, you’ve done so only on an intellectual basis. That’s
not good enough, because people are not inspired to act by reason
alone.</p>
<p>The other way to persuade people—and ultimately a much more powerful
way—is by uniting an idea with an emotion. The best way to do that is by
telling a compelling story. In a story, you not only weave a lot of
information into the telling but you also arouse your listener’s
emotions and energy. Persuading with a story is hard. Any intelligent
person can sit down and make lists. It takes rationality but little
creativity to design an argument using conventional rhetoric. But it
demands vivid insight and storytelling skill to present an idea that
packs enough emotional power to be memorable. If you can harness
imagination and the principles of a well-told story, then you get people
rising to their feet amid thunderous applause instead of yawning and
ignoring you.</p>
<p>So, what is a story?</p>
<p>Essentially, a story expresses how and why life changes. It begins
with a situation in which life is relatively in balance: You come to
work day after day, week after week, and everything’s fine. You expect
it will go on that way. But then there’s an event—in screenwriting, we
call it the “inciting incident”—that throws life out of balance. You get
a new job, or the boss dies of a heart attack, or a big customer
threatens to leave. The story goes on to describe how, in an effort to
restore balance, the protagonist’s subjective expectations crash into an
uncooperative objective reality. A good storyteller describes what it’s
like to deal with these opposing forces, calling on the protagonist to
dig deeper, work with scarce resources, make difficult decisions, take
action despite risks, and ultimately discover the truth. All great
storytellers since the dawn of time—from the ancient Greeks through
Shakespeare and up to the present day—have dealt with this fundamental
conflict between subjective expectation and cruel reality.</p>
<p>How would an executive learn to tell stories?</p>
<p>Stories have been implanted in you thousands of times since your
mother took you on her knee. You’ve read good books, seen movies,
attended plays. What’s more, human beings naturally want to work through
stories. Cognitive psychologists describe how the human mind, in its
attempt to understand and remember, assembles the bits and pieces of
experience into a story, beginning with a personal desire, a life
objective, and then portraying the struggle against the forces that
block that desire. Stories are how we remember; we tend to forget lists
and bullet points.</p>
<p>Businesspeople not only have to understand their companies’ past, but
then they must project the future. And how do you imagine the future? As
a story. You create scenarios in your head of possible future events to
try to anticipate the life of your company or your own personal life.
So, if a businessperson understands that his or her own mind naturally
wants to frame experience in a story, the key to moving an audience is
not to resist this impulse but to embrace it by telling a good
story.</p>
<p>What makes a good story?</p>
<p>You emphatically do not want to tell a beginning-to-end tale
describing how results meet expectations. This is boring and banal.
Instead, you want to display the struggle between expectation and
reality in all its nastiness.</p>
<p>For example, let’s imagine the story of a biotech startup we’ll call
Chemcorp, whose CEO has to persuade some Wall Street bankers to invest
in the company. He could tell them that Chemcorp has discovered a
chemical compound that prevents heart attacks and offer up a lot of
slides showing them the size of the market, the business plan, the
organizational chart, and so on. The bankers would nod politely and
stifle yawns while thinking of all the other companies better positioned
in Chemcorp’s market.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the CEO could turn his pitch into a story, beginning
with someone close to him—say, his father—who died of a heart attack. So
nature itself is the first antagonist that the CEO-as-protagonist must
overcome. The story might unfold like this: In his grief, he realizes
that if there had been some chemical indication of heart disease, his
father’s death could have been prevented. His company discovers a
protein that’s present in the blood just before heart attacks and
develops an easy-to-administer, low-cost test.</p>
<p>But now it faces a new antagonist: the FDA. The approval process is
fraught with risks and dangers. The FDA turns down the first
application, but new research reveals that the test performs even better
than anyone had expected, so the agency approves a second application.
Meanwhile, Chemcorp is running out of money, and a key partner drops out
and goes off to start his own company. Now Chemcorp is in a
fight-to-the-finish patent race.</p>
<p>This accumulation of antagonists creates great suspense. The
protagonist has raised the idea in the bankers’ heads that the story
might not have a happy ending. By now, he has them on the edge of their
seats, and he says, “We won the race, we got the patent, we’re poised to
go public and save a quarter-million lives a year.” And the bankers just
throw money at him.</p>
<p>Aren’t you really talking about exaggeration and manipulation?</p>
<p>No. Although businesspeople are often suspicious of stories for the
reasons you suggest, the fact is that statistics are used to tell lies
and damn lies, while accounting reports are often BS in a ball
gown—witness Enron and WorldCom.</p>
<p>When people ask me to help them turn their presentations into
stories, I begin by asking questions. I kind of psychoanalyze their
companies, and amazing dramas pour out. But most companies and
executives sweep the dirty laundry, the difficulties, the antagonists,
and the struggle under the carpet. They prefer to present a rosy—and
boring—picture to the world. But as a storyteller, you want to position
the problems in the foreground and then show how you’ve overcome them.
When you tell the story of your struggles against real antagonists, your
audience sees you as an exciting, dynamic person. And I know that the
storytelling method works, because after I consulted with a dozen
corporations whose principals told exciting stories to Wall Street, they
all got their money.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with painting a positive picture?</p>
<p>It doesn’t ring true. You can send out a press release talking about
increased sales and a bright future, but your audience knows it’s never
that easy. They know you’re not spotless; they know your competitor
doesn’t wear a black hat. They know you’ve slanted your statement to
make your company look good. Positive, hypothetical pictures and
boilerplate press releases actually work against you because they foment
distrust among the people you’re trying to convince. I suspect that most
CEOs do not believe their own spin doctors—and if they don’t believe the
hype, why should the public?</p>
<p>The great irony of existence is that what makes life worth living
does not come from the rosy side. We would all rather be lotus-eaters,
but life will not allow it. The energy to live comes from the dark side.
It comes from everything that makes us suffer. As we struggle against
these negative powers, we’re forced to live more deeply, more fully.</p>
<p>So acknowledging this dark side makes you more convincing?</p>
<p>Of course. Because you’re more truthful. One of the principles of
good storytelling is the understanding that we all live in dread. Fear
is when you don’t know what’s going to happen. Dread is when you know
what’s going to happen and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. Death
is the great dread; we all live in an ever-shrinking shadow of time, and
between now and then all kinds of bad things could happen.</p>
<p>Most of us repress this dread. We get rid of it by inflicting it on
other people through sarcasm, cheating, abuse, indifference—cruelties
great and small. We all commit those little evils that relieve the
pressure and make us feel better. Then we rationalize our bad behavior
and convince ourselves we’re good people. Institutions do the same
thing: They deny the existence of the negative while inflicting their
dread on other institutions or their employees.</p>
<p>If you’re a realist, you know that this is human nature; in fact, you
realize that this behavior is the foundation of all nature. The
imperative in nature is to follow the golden rule of survival: Do unto
others what they do unto you. In nature, if you offer cooperation and
get cooperation back, you get along. But if you offer cooperation and
get antagonism back, then you give antagonism in return—in spades.</p>
<p>Ever since human beings sat around the fire in caves, we’ve told
stories to help us deal with the dread of life and the struggle to
survive. All great stories illuminate the dark side. I’m not talking
about so-called “pure” evil, because there is no such thing. We are all
evil and good, and these sides do continual battle. Kenneth Lay says
wiping out people’s jobs and life savings was unintentional. Hannibal
Lecter is witty, charming, and brilliant, and he eats people’s livers.
Audiences appreciate the truthfulness of a storyteller who acknowledges
the dark side of human beings and deals honestly with antagonistic
events. The story engenders a positive but realistic energy in the
people who hear it.</p>
<p>Does this mean you have to be a pessimist?</p>
<p>It’s not a question of whether you’re optimistic or pessimistic. It
seems to me that the civilized human being is a skeptic—someone who
believes nothing at face value. Skepticism is another principle of the
storyteller. The skeptic understands the difference between text and
subtext and always seeks what’s really going on. The skeptic hunts for
the truth beneath the surface of life, knowing that the real thoughts
and feelings of institutions or individuals are unconscious and
unexpressed. The skeptic is always looking behind the mask. Street kids,
for example, with their tattoos, piercings, chains, and leather, wear
amazing masks, but the skeptic knows the mask is only a persona. Inside
anyone working that hard to look fierce is a marshmallow. Genuinely hard
people make no effort.</p>
<p>So, a story that embraces darkness produces a positive energy in
listeners?</p>
<p>Absolutely. We follow people in whom we believe. The best leaders
I’ve dealt with—producers and directors—have come to terms with dark
reality. Instead of communicating via spin doctors, they lead their
actors and crews through the antagonism of a world in which the odds of
getting the film made, distributed, and sold to millions of moviegoers
are a thousand to one. They appreciate that the people who work for them
love the work and live for the small triumphs that contribute to the
final triumph.</p>
<p>CEOs, likewise, have to sit at the head of the table or in front of
the microphone and navigate their companies through the storms of bad
economies and tough competition. If you look your audience in the eye,
lay out your really scary challenges, and say, “We’ll be lucky as hell
if we get through this, but here’s what I think we should do,” they will
listen to you.</p>
<p>To get people behind you, you can tell a truthful story. The story of
General Electric is wonderful and has nothing to do with Jack Welch’s
cult of celebrity. If you have a grand view of life, you can see it on
all its complex levels and celebrate it in a story. A great CEO is
someone who has come to terms with his or her own mortality and, as a
result, has compassion for others. This compassion is expressed in
stories.</p>
<p>Take the love of work, for example. Years ago, when I was in graduate
school, I worked as an insurance fraud investigator. The claimant in one
case was an immigrant who’d suffered a terrible head injury on a
carmaker’s assembly line. He’d been the fastest window assembler on the
line and took great pride in his work. When I spoke to him, he was
waiting to have a titanium plate inserted into his head.</p>
<p>The man had been grievously injured, but the company thought he was a
fraud. In spite of that, he remained incredibly dedicated. All he wanted
was to get back to work. He knew the value of work, no matter how
repetitive. He took pride in it and even in the company that had falsely
accused him. How wonderful it would have been for the CEO of that car
company to tell the tale of how his managers recognized the falseness of
their accusation and then rewarded the employee for his dedication. The
company, in turn, would have been rewarded with redoubled effort from
all the employees who heard that story.</p>
<p>How do storytellers discover and unearth the stories that want to be
told?</p>
<p>The storyteller discovers a story by asking certain key questions.
First, what does my protagonist want in order to restore balance in his
or her life? Desire is the blood of a story. Desire is not a shopping
list but a core need that, if satisfied, would stop the story in its
tracks. Next, what is keeping my protagonist from achieving his or her
desire? Forces within? Doubt? Fear? Confusion? Personal conflicts with
friends, family, lovers? Social conflicts arising in the various
institutions in society? Physical conflicts? The forces of Mother
Nature? Lethal diseases in the air? Not enough time to get things done?
The damned automobile that won’t start? Antagonists come from people,
society, time, space, and every object in it, or any combination of
these forces at once. Then, how would my protagonist decide to act in
order to achieve his or her desire in the face of these antagonistic
forces? It’s in the answer to that question that storytellers discover
the truth of their characters, because the heart of a human being is
revealed in the choices he or she makes under pressure. Finally, the
storyteller leans back from the design of events he or she has created
and asks, “Do I believe this? Is it neither an exaggeration nor a
soft-soaping of the struggle? Is this an honest telling, though heaven
may fall?”</p>
<p>Does being a good storyteller make you a good leader?</p>
<p>Not necessarily, but if you understand the principles of
storytelling, you probably have a good understanding of yourself and of
human nature, and that tilts the odds in your favor. I can teach the
formal principles of stories, but not to a person who hasn’t really
lived. The art of storytelling takes intelligence, but it also demands a
life experience that I’ve noted in gifted film directors: the pain of
childhood. Childhood trauma forces you into a kind of mild schizophrenia
that makes you see life simultaneously in two ways: First, it’s direct,
real-time experience, but at the same moment, your brain records it as
material—material out of which you will create business ideas, science,
or art. Like a double-edged knife, the creative mind cuts to the truth
of self and the humanity of others.</p>
<p>Self-knowledge is the root of all great storytelling. A storyteller
creates all characters from the self by asking the question, “If I were
this character in these circumstances, what would I do?” The more you
understand your own humanity, the more you can appreciate the humanity
of others in all their good-versus-evil struggles. I would argue that
the great leaders Jim Collins describes are people with enormous
self-knowledge. They have self-insight and self-respect balanced by
skepticism. Great story tellers—and, I suspect, great leaders—are
skeptics who understand their own masks as well as the masks of life,
and this understanding makes them humble. They see the humanity in
others and deal with them in a compassionate yet realistic way. That
duality makes for a wonderful leader.</p>
