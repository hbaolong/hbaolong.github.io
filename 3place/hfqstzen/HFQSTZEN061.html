<h4 id="the-power-of-talk-who-gets-heard-and-why">5 The Power of Talk:
Who Gets Heard and Why</h4>
<p>By Deborah Tannen</p>
<p>The head of a large division of a multinational corporation was
running a meeting devoted to performance assessment. Each senior manager
stood up, reviewed the individuals in his group, and evaluated them for
promotion. Although there were women in every group, not one of them
made the cut. One after another, each manager declared, in effect, that
every woman in his group didn’t have the self-confidence needed to be
promoted. The division head began to doubt his ears. How could it be
that all the talented women in the division suffered from a lack of
self-confidence?</p>
<p>In all likelihood, they didn’t. Consider the many women who have left
large corporations to start their own businesses, obviously exhibiting
enough confidence to succeed on their own. Judgments about confidence
can be inferred only from the way people present themselves, and much of
that presentation is in the form of talk.</p>
<p>The CEO of a major corporation told me that he often has to make
decisions in five minutes about matters on which others may have worked
five months. He said he uses this rule: If the person making the
proposal seems confident, the CEO approves it. If not, he says no. This
might seem like a reasonable approach. But my field of research,
socio-linguistics, suggests otherwise. The CEO obviously thinks he knows
what a confident person sounds like. But his judgment, which may be dead
right for some people, may be dead wrong for others.</p>
<p>Communication isn’t as simple as saying what you mean. How you say
what you mean is crucial, and differs from one person to the next,
because using language is learned social behavior: How we talk and
listen are deeply influenced by cultural experience. Although we might
think that our ways of saying what we mean are natural, we can run into
trouble if we interpret and evaluate others as if they necessarily felt
the same way we’d feel if we spoke the way they did.</p>
<p>Since 1974, I have been researching the influence of linguistic style
on conversations and human relationships. In the past four years, I have
extended that research to the workplace, where I have observed how ways
of speaking learned in childhood affect judgments of competence and
confidence, as well as who gets heard, who gets credit, and what gets
done.</p>
<p>The division head who was dumbfounded to hear that all the talented
women in his organization lacked confidence was probably right to be
skeptical. The senior managers were judging the women in their groups by
their own linguistic norms, but women—like people who have grown up in a
different culture—have often learned different styles of speaking than
men, which can make them seem less competent and self-assured than they
are.</p>
<p>What is linguistic style?</p>
<p>Everything that is said must be said in a certain way—in a certain
tone of voice, at a certain rate of speed, and with a certain degree of
loudness. Whereas often we consciously consider what to say before
speaking, we rarely think about how to say it, unless the situation is
obviously loaded—for example, a job interview or a tricky performance
review. Linguistic style refers to a person’s characteristic speaking
pattern. It includes such features as directness or indirectness, pacing
and pausing, word choice, and the use of such elements as jokes, figures
of speech, stories, questions, and apologies. In other words, linguistic
style is a set of culturally learned signals by which we not only
communicate what we mean but also interpret others’ meaning and evaluate
one another as people.</p>
<p>Consider turn taking, one element of linguistic style. Conversation
is an enterprise in which people take turns: One person speaks, then the
other responds. However, this apparently simple exchange requires a
subtle negotiation of signals so that you know when the other person is
finished and it’s your turn to begin. Cultural factors such as country
or region of origin and ethnic background influence how long a pause
seems natural. When Bob, who is from Detroit, has a conversation with
his colleague Joe, from New York City, it’s hard for him to get a word
in edgewise because he expects a slightly longer pause between turns
than Joe does. A pause of that length never comes because, before it has
a chance to, Joe senses an uncomfortable silence, which he fills with
more talk of his own. Both men fail to realize that differences in
conversational style are getting in their way. Bob thinks that Joe is
pushy and uninterested in what he has to say, and Joe thinks that Bob
doesn’t have much to contribute. Similarly, when Sally relocated from
Texas to Washington, D.C., she kept searching for the right time to
break in during staff meetings—and never found it. Although in Texas she
was considered outgoing and confident, in Washington she was perceived
as shy and retiring. Her boss even suggested she take an assertiveness
training course. Thus, slight differences in conversational style—in
these cases, a few seconds of pause—can have a surprising impact on who
gets heard and on the judgments, including psychological ones, that are
made about people and their abilities.</p>
<p>Every utterance functions on two levels. We’re all familiar with the
first one: Language communicates ideas. The second level is mostly
invisible to us, but it plays a powerful role in communication. As a
form of social behavior, language also negotiates relationships. Through
ways of speaking, we signal—and create—the relative status of speakers
and their level of rapport. If you say, “Sit down!” you are signaling
that you have higher status than the person you are addressing, that you
are so close to each other that you can drop all pleasantries, or that
you are angry. If you say, “I would be honored if you would sit down,”
you are signaling great respect—or great sarcasm, depending on your tone
of voice, the situation, and what you both know about how close you
really are. If you say, “You must be so tired. Why don’t you sit down,”
you are communicating either closeness and concern or condescension.
Each of these ways of saying “the same thing”—telling someone to sit
down—can have a vastly different meaning.</p>
<p>In every community known to linguists, the patterns that constitute
linguistic style are relatively different for men and women. What’s
“natural” for most men speaking a given language is, in some cases,
different from what’s “natural” for most women. That is because we learn
ways of speaking as children growing up, especially from peers, and
children tend to play with other children of the same sex. The research
of sociologists, anthropologists, and psychologists observing American
children at play has shown that, although both girls and boys find ways
of creating rapport and negotiating status, girls tend to learn
conversational rituals that focus on the rapport dimension of
relationships whereas boys tend to learn rituals that focus on the
status dimension.</p>
<p>Girls tend to play with a single best friend or in small groups, and
they spend a lot of time talking. They use language to negotiate how
close they are; for example, the girl you tell your secrets to becomes
your best friend. Girls learn to downplay ways in which one is better
than the others and to emphasize ways in which they are all the same.
From childhood, most girls learn that sounding too sure of themselves
will make them unpopular with their peers—although nobody really takes
such modesty literally. A group of girls will ostracize a girl who calls
attention to her own superiority and criticize her by saying, “She
thinks she’s something”; and a girl who tells others what to do is
called “bossy.” Thus, girls learn to talk in ways that balance their own
needs with those of others—to save face for one another in the broadest
sense of the term.</p>
<p>Boys tend to play very differently. They usually play in larger
groups in which more boys can be included, but not everyone is treated
as an equal. Boys with high status in their group are expected to
emphasize rather than downplay their status, and usually one or several
boys will be seen as the leader or leaders. Boys generally don’t accuse
one another of being bossy, because the leader is expected to tell
lower-status boys what to do. Boys learn to use language to negotiate
their status in the group by displaying their abilities and knowledge,
and by challenging others and resisting challenges. Giving orders is one
way of getting and keeping the high-status role. Another is taking
center stage by telling stories or jokes.</p>
<p>This is not to say that all boys and girls grow up this way or feel
comfortable in these groups or are equally successful at negotiating
within these norms. But, for the most part, these childhood play groups
are where boys and girls learn their conversational styles. In this
sense, they grow up in different worlds. The result is that women and
men tend to have different habitual ways of saying what they mean, and
conversations between them can be like cross-cultural communication: You
can’t assume that the other person means what you would mean if you said
the same thing in the same way.</p>
<p>My research in companies across the United States shows that the
lessons learned in childhood carry over into the workplace. Consider the
following example: A focus group was organized at a major multinational
company to evaluate a recently implemented flextime policy. The
participants sat in a circle and discussed the new system. The group
concluded that it was excellent, but they also agreed on ways to improve
it. The meeting went well and was deemed a success by all, according to
my own observations and everyone’s comments to me. But the next day, I
was in for a surprise.</p>
<p>I had left the meeting with the impression that Phil had been
responsible for most of the suggestions adopted by the group. But as I
typed up my notes, I noticed that Cheryl had made almost all those
suggestions. I had thought that the key ideas came from Phil because he
had picked up Cheryl’s points and supported them, speaking at greater
length in doing so than she had in raising them.</p>
<p>It would be easy to regard Phil as having stolen Cheryl’s ideas—and
her thunder. But that would be inaccurate. Phil never claimed Cheryl’s
ideas as his own. Cheryl herself told me later that she left the meeting
confident she had contributed significantly, and that she appreciated
Phil’s support. She volunteered, with a laugh, “It was not one of those
times when a woman says something and it’s ignored, then a man says it
and it’s picked up.” In other words, Cheryl and Phil worked well as a
team, the group fulfilled its charge, and the company got what it
needed. So what was the problem?</p>
<p>I went back and asked all the participants who they thought had been
the most influential group member, the one most responsible for the
ideas that had been adopted. The pattern of answers was revealing. The
two other women in the group named Cheryl. Two of the three men named
Phil. Of the men, only Phil named Cheryl. In other words, in this
instance, the women evaluated the contribution of another woman more
accurately than the men did.</p>
<p>Meetings like this take place daily in companies around the country.
Unless managers are unusually good at listening closely to how people
say what they mean, the talents of someone like Cheryl may well be
undervalued and underutilized.</p>
<p>One up, one down</p>
<p>Individual speakers vary in how sensitive they are to the social
dynamics of language—in other words, to the subtle nuances of what
others say to them. Men tend to be sensitive to the power dynamics of
interaction, speaking in ways that position themselves as one up and
resisting being put in a one-down position by others. Women tend to
react more strongly to the rapport dynamic, speaking in ways that save
face for others and buffering statements that could be seen as putting
others in a one-down position. These linguistic patterns are pervasive;
you can hear them in hundreds of exchanges in the workplace every day.
And, as in the case of Cheryl and Phil, they affect who gets heard and
who gets credit.</p>
<p>Getting credit</p>
<p>Even so small a linguistic strategy as the choice of pronoun can
affect who gets credit. In my research in the workplace, I heard men say
“I” in situations where I heard women say “we.” For example, one
publishing company executive said, “I’m hiring a new manager. I’m going
to put him in charge of my marketing division,” as if he owned the
corporation. In stark contrast, I recorded women saying “we” when
referring to work they alone had done. One woman explained that it would
sound too self-promoting to claim credit in an obvious way by saying, “I
did this.” Yet she expected—sometimes vainly—that others would know it
was her work and would give her the credit she did not claim for
herself.</p>
<p>Managers might leap to the conclusion that women who do not take
credit for what they’ve done should be taught to do so. But that
solution is problematic because we associate ways of speaking with moral
qualities: The way we speak is who we are and who we want to be.</p>
<p>Veronica, a senior researcher in a high-tech company, had an
observant boss. He noticed that many of the ideas coming out of the
group were hers but that often someone else trumpeted them around the
office and got credit for them. He advised her to “own” her ideas and
make sure she got the credit. But Veronica found she simply didn’t enjoy
her work if she had to approach it as what seemed to her an unattractive
and unappealing “grabbing game.” It was her dislike of such behavior
that had led her to avoid it in the first place.</p>
<p>Whatever the motivation, women are less likely than men to have
learned to blow their own horn. And they are more likely than men to
believe that if they do so, they won’t be liked.</p>
<p>Many have argued that the growing trend of assigning work to teams
may be especially congenial to women, but it may also create
complications for performance evaluation. When ideas are generated and
work is accomplished in the privacy of the team, the outcome of the
team’s effort may become associated with the person most vocal about
reporting results. There are many women and men—but probably relatively
more women—who are reluctant to put themselves forward in this way and
who consequently risk not getting credit for their contributions.</p>
<p>Confidence and boasting</p>
<p>The CEO who based his decisions on the confidence level of speakers
was articulating a value that is widely shared in U.S. businesses: One
way to judge confidence is by an individual’s behavior, especially
verbal behavior. Here again, many women are at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Studies show that women are more likely to downplay their certainty
and men are more likely to minimize their doubts. Psychologist Laurie
Heatherington and her colleagues devised an ingenious experiment, which
they reported in the journal Sex Roles.1 They asked hundreds of incoming
college students to predict what grades they would get in their first
year. Some subjects were asked to make their predictions privately by
writing them down and placing them in an envelope; others were asked to
make their predictions publicly, in the presence of a researcher. The
results showed that more women than men predicted lower grades for
themselves if they made their predictions publicly. If they made their
predictions privately, the predictions were the same as those of the
men—and the same as their actual grades. This study provides evidence
that what comes across as lack of confidence—predicting lower grades for
oneself—may reflect not one’s actual level of confidence but the desire
not to seem boastful.</p>
<p>These habits with regard to appearing humble or confident result from
the socialization of boys and girls by their peers in childhood play. As
adults, both women and men find these behaviors reinforced by the
positive responses they get from friends and relatives who share the
same norms. But the norms of behavior in the U.S. business world are
based on the style of interaction that is more common among men—at
least, among American men.</p>
<p>Asking questions</p>
<p>Although asking the right questions is one of the hallmarks of a good
manager, how and when questions are asked can send unintended signals
about competence and power. In a group, if only one person asks
questions, he or she risks being seen as the only ignorant one.
Furthermore, we judge others not only by how they speak but also by how
they are spoken to. The person who asks questions may end up being
lectured to and looking like a novice under a schoolmaster’s tutelage.
The way boys are socialized makes them more likely to be aware of the
underlying power dynamic by which a question asker can be seen in a
one-down position.</p>
<p>One practicing physician learned the hard way that any exchange of
information can become the basis for judgments—or misjudgments—about
competence. During her training, she received a negative evaluation that
she thought was unfair, so she asked her supervising physician for an
explanation. He said that she knew less than her peers. Amazed at his
answer, she asked how he had reached that conclusion. He said, “You ask
more questions.”</p>
<p>Along with cultural influences and individual personality, gender
seems to play a role in whether and when people ask questions. For
example, of all the observations I’ve made in lectures and books, the
one that sparks the most enthusiastic flash of recognition is that men
are less likely than women to stop and ask for directions when they are
lost. I explain that men often resist asking for directions because they
are aware that it puts them in a one-down position and because they
value the independence that comes with finding their way by themselves.
Asking for directions while driving is only one instance—along with many
others that researchers have examined—in which men seem less likely than
women to ask questions. I believe this is because they are more attuned
than women to the potential face-losing aspect of asking questions. And
men who believe that asking questions might reflect negatively on them
may, in turn, be likely to form a negative opinion of others who ask
questions in situations where they would not.</p>
<p>Conversational rituals</p>
<p>Conversation is fundamentally ritual in the sense that we speak in
ways our culture has conventionalized and expect certain types of
responses. Take greetings, for example. I have heard visitors to the
United States complain that Americans are hypocritical because they ask
how you are but aren’t interested in the answer. To Americans, “How are
you?” is obviously a ritualized way to start a conversation rather than
a literal request for information. In other parts of the world,
including the Philippines, people ask each other, “Where are you going?”
when they meet. The question seems intrusive to Americans, who do not
realize that it, too, is a ritual query to which the only expected reply
is a vague “Over there.”</p>
<p>It’s easy and entertaining to observe different rituals in foreign
countries. But we don’t expect differences, and are far less likely to
recognize the ritualized nature of our conversations, when we are with
our compatriots at work. Our differing rituals can be even more
problematic when we think we’re all speaking the same language.</p>
<p>Apologies</p>
<p>Consider the simple phrase I’m sorry.</p>
<p>Catherine: How did that big presentation go?</p>
<p>Bob: Oh, not very well. I got a lot of flak from the VP for finance,
and I didn’t have the numbers at my fingertips.</p>
<p>Catherine: Oh, I’m sorry. I know how hard you worked on that.</p>
<p>In this case, I’m sorry probably means “I’m sorry that happened,” not
“I apologize,” unless it was Catherine’s responsibility to supply Bob
with the numbers for the presentation. Women tend to say I’m sorry more
frequently than men—and often they intend it in this way—as a ritualized
means of expressing concern. It’s one of many learned elements of
conversational style that girls often use to establish rapport. Ritual
apologies—like other conversational rituals—work well when both parties
share the same assumptions about their use. But people who utter
frequent ritual apologies may end up appearing weaker, less confident,
and literally more blameworthy than people who don’t.</p>
<p>Apologies tend to be regarded differently by men, who are more likely
to focus on the status implications of exchanges. Many men avoid
apologies because they see them as putting the speaker in a one-down
position. I observed with some amazement an encounter among several
lawyers engaged in a negotiation over a speakerphone. At one point, the
lawyer in whose office I was sitting accidentally elbowed the telephone
and cut off the call. When his secretary got the parties back on again,
I expected him to say what I would have said: “Sorry about that. I
knocked the phone with my elbow.” Instead, he said, “Hey, what happened?
One minute you were there; the next minute you were gone!” This lawyer
seemed to have an automatic impulse not to admit fault if he didn’t have
to. For me, it was one of those pivotal moments when you realize that
the world you live in is not the one everyone lives in and that the way
you assume is the way to talk is really only one of many.</p>
<p>Those who caution managers not to undermine their authority by
apologizing are approaching interaction from the perspective of the
power dynamic. In many cases, this strategy is effective. On the other
hand, when I asked people what frustrated them in their jobs, one
frequently voiced complaint was working with or for someone who refuses
to apologize or admit fault. In other words, accepting responsibility
for errors and admitting mistakes may be an equally effective or
superior strategy in some settings.</p>
<p>Feedback</p>
<p>Styles of giving feedback contain a ritual element that often is the
cause for misunderstanding. Consider the following exchange: A manager
had to tell her marketing director to rewrite a report. She began this
potentially awkward task by citing the report’s strengths and then moved
to the main point: the weaknesses that needed to be remedied. The
marketing director seemed to understand and accept his supervisor’s
comments, but his revision contained only minor changes and failed to
address the major weaknesses. When the manager told him of her
dissatisfaction, he accused her of misleading him: “You told me it was
fine.”</p>
<p>The impasse resulted from different linguistic styles. To the
manager, it was natural to buffer the criticism by beginning with
praise. Telling her subordinate that his report is inadequate and has to
be rewritten puts him in a one-down position. Praising him for the parts
that are good is a ritualized way of saving face for him. But the
marketing director did not share his supervisor’s assumption about how
feedback should be given. Instead, he assumed that what she mentioned
first was the main point and that what she brought up later was an
afterthought.</p>
<p>Those who expect feedback to come in the way the manager presented it
would appreciate her tact and would regard a more blunt approach as
unnecessarily callous. But those who share the marketing director’s
assumptions would regard the blunt approach as honest and no-nonsense,
and the manager’s as obfuscating. Because each one’s assumptions seemed
self-evident, each blamed the other: The manager thought the marketing
director was not listening, and he thought she had not communicated
clearly or had changed her mind. This is significant because it
illustrates that incidents labeled vaguely as “poor communication” may
be the result of differing linguistic styles.</p>
<p>Compliments</p>
<p>Exchanging compliments is a common ritual, especially among women. A
mismatch in expectations about this ritual left Susan, a manager in the
human resources field, in a one-down position. She and her colleague
Bill had both given presentations at a national conference. On the
airplane home, Susan told Bill, “That was a great talk!” “Thank you,” he
said. Then she asked, “What did you think of mine?” He responded with a
lengthy and detailed critique, as she listened uncomfortably. An
unpleasant feeling of having been put down came over her. Somehow she
had been positioned as the novice in need of his expert advice. Even
worse, she had only herself to blame, since she had, after all, asked
Bill what he thought of her talk.</p>
<p>But had Susan asked for the response she received? When she asked
Bill what he thought about her talk, she expected to hear not a critique
but a compliment. In fact, her question had been an attempt to repair a
ritual gone awry. Susan’s initial compliment to Bill was the kind of
automatic recognition she felt was more or less required after a
colleague gives a presentation, and she expected Bill to respond with a
matching compliment. She was just talking automatically, but he either
sincerely misunderstood the ritual or simply took the opportunity to
bask in the one-up position of critic. Whatever his motivation, it was
Susan’s attempt to spark an exchange of compliments that gave him an
opening.</p>
<p>Although this exchange could have occurred between two men, it does
not seem coincidental that it happened between a man and a woman.
Linguist Janet Holmes discovered that women pay more compliments than
men.2 And, as I have observed, fewer men are likely to ask, “What did
you think of my talk?” precisely because the question might invite an
unwanted critique.</p>
<p>In the social structure of the peer groups in which they grow up,
boys are indeed looking for opportunities to put others down and take
the one-up position for themselves. In contrast, one of the rituals
girls learn is taking the one-down position but assuming that the other
person will recognize the ritual nature of the self-denigration and pull
them back up.</p>
<p>The exchange between Susan and Bill also suggests how women’s and
men’s characteristic styles may put women at a disadvantage in the
workplace. If one person is trying to minimize status differences,
maintain an appearance that everyone is equal, and save face for the
other, while another person is trying to maintain the one-up position
and avoid being positioned as one down, the person seeking the one-up
position is likely to get it. At the same time, the person who has not
been expending any effort to avoid the one-down position is likely to
end up in it. Because women are more likely to take (or accept) the role
of advice seeker, men are more inclined to interpret a ritual question
from a woman as a request for advice.</p>
<p>Ritual opposition</p>
<p>Apologizing, mitigating criticism with praise, and exchanging
compliments are rituals common among women that men often take
literally. A ritual common among men that women often take literally is
ritual opposition.</p>
<p>A woman in communications told me she watched with distaste and
distress as her office mate argued heatedly with another colleague about
whose division should suffer budget cuts. She was even more surprised,
however, that a short time later they were as friendly as ever. “How can
you pretend that fight never happened?” she asked. “Who’s pretending it
never happened?” he responded, as puzzled by her question as she had
been by his behavior. “It happened,” he said, “and it’s over.” What she
took as literal fighting to him was a routine part of daily negotiation:
a ritual fight.</p>
<p>Many Americans expect the discussion of ideas to be a ritual
fight—that is, an exploration through verbal opposition. They present
their own ideas in the most certain and absolute form they can, and wait
to see if they are challenged. Being forced to defend an idea provides
an opportunity to test it. In the same spirit, they may play devil’s
advocate in challenging their colleagues’ ideas—trying to poke holes and
find weaknesses—as a way of helping them explore and test their
ideas.</p>
<p>This style can work well if everyone shares it, but those
unaccustomed to it are likely to miss its ritual nature. They may give
up an idea that is challenged, taking the objections as an indication
that the idea was a poor one. Worse, they may take the opposition as a
personal attack and may find it impossible to do their best in a
contentious environment. People unaccustomed to this style may hedge
when stating their ideas in order to fend off potential attacks.
Ironically, this posture makes their arguments appear weak and is more
likely to invite attack from pugnacious colleagues than to fend it
off.</p>
<p>Ritual opposition can even play a role in who gets hired. Some
consulting firms that recruit graduates from the top business schools
use a confrontational interviewing technique. They challenge the
candidate to “crack a case” in real time. A partner at one firm told me,
“Women tend to do less well in this kind of interaction, and it
certainly affects who gets hired. But, in fact, many women who don’t
‘test well’ turn out to be good consultants. They’re often smarter than
some of the men who looked like analytic power houses under
pressure.”</p>
<p>The level of verbal opposition varies from one company’s culture to
the next, but I saw instances of it in all the organizations I studied.
Anyone who is uncomfortable with this linguistic style—and that includes
some men as well as many women—risks appearing insecure about his or her
ideas.</p>
<p>Negotiating authority</p>
<p>In organizations, formal authority comes from the position one holds.
But actual authority has to be negotiated day to day. The effectiveness
of individual managers depends in part on their skill in negotiating
authority and on whether others reinforce or undercut their efforts. The
way linguistic style reflects status plays a subtle role in placing
individuals within a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Managing up and down</p>
<p>In all the companies I researched, I heard from women who knew they
were doing a superior job and knew that their coworkers (and sometimes
their immediate bosses) knew it as well, but believed that the
higher-ups did not. They frequently told me that something outside
themselves was holding them back and found it frustrating because they
thought that all that should be necessary for success was to do a great
job, that superior performance should be recognized and rewarded. In
contrast, men often told me that if women weren’t promoted, it was
because they simply weren’t up to snuff. Looking around, however, I saw
evidence that men more often than women behaved in ways likely to get
them recognized by those with the power to determine their
advancement.</p>
<p>In all the companies I visited, I observed what happened at
lunchtime. I saw young men who regularly ate lunch with their boss, and
senior men who ate with the big boss. I noticed far fewer women who
sought out the highest-level person they could eat with. But one is more
likely to get recognition for work done if one talks about it to those
higher up, and it is easier to do so if the lines of communication are
already open. Furthermore, given the opportunity for a conversation with
superiors, men and women are likely to have different ways of talking
about their accomplishments because of the different ways in which they
were socialized as children. Boys are rewarded by their peers if they
talk up their achievements, whereas girls are rewarded if they play
theirs down. Linguistic styles common among men may tend to give them
some advantages when it comes to managing up.</p>
<p>All speakers are aware of the status of the person they are talking
to and adjust accordingly. Everyone speaks differently when talking to a
boss than when talking to a subordinate. But, surprisingly, the ways in
which they adjust their talk may be different and thus may project
different images of themselves.</p>
<p>Communications researchers Karen Tracy and Eric Eisenberg studied how
relative status affects the way people give criticism. They devised a
business letter that contained some errors and asked 13 male and 11
female college students to role-play delivering criticism under two
scenarios. In the first, the speaker was a boss talking to a
subordinate; in the second, the speaker was a subordinate talking to his
or her boss. The researchers measured how hard the speakers tried to
avoid hurting the feelings of the person they were criticizing.</p>
<p>One might expect people to be more careful about how they deliver
criticism when they are in a subordinate position. Tracy and Eisenberg
found that hypothesis to be true for the men in their study but not for
the women. As they reported in Research on Language and Social
Interaction, the women showed more concern about the other person’s
feelings when they were playing the role of superior.3 In other words,
the women were more careful to save face for the other person when they
were managing down than when they were managing up. This pattern recalls
the way girls are socialized: Those who are in some way superior are
expected to downplay rather than flaunt their superiority.</p>
<p>In my own recordings of workplace communication, I observed women
talking in similar ways. For example, when a manager had to correct a
mistake made by her secretary, she did so by acknowledging that there
were mitigating circumstances. She said, laughing, “You know, it’s hard
to do things around here, isn’t it, with all these people coming in!”
The manager was saving face for her subordinate, just like the female
students role-playing in the Tracy and Eisenberg study.</p>
<p>Is this an effective way to communicate? One must ask, effective for
what? The manager in question established a positive environment in her
group, and the work was done effectively. On the other hand, numerous
women in many different fields told me that their bosses say they don’t
project the proper authority.</p>
<p>Indirectness</p>
<p>Another linguistic signal that varies with power and status is
indirectness—the tendency to say what we mean without spelling it out in
so many words. Despite the widespread belief in the United States that
it’s always best to say exactly what we mean, indirectness is a
fundamental and pervasive element in human communication. It also is one
of the elements that vary most from one culture to another, and it can
cause enormous misunderstanding when speakers have different habits and
expectations about how it is used. It’s often said that American women
are more indirect than American men, but in fact everyone tends to be
indirect in some situations and in different ways. Allowing for
cultural, ethnic, regional, and individual differences, women are
especially likely to be indirect when it comes to telling others what to
do, which is not surprising, considering girls’ readiness to brand other
girls as bossy. On the other hand, men are especially likely to be
indirect when it comes to admitting fault or weakness, which also is not
surprising, considering boys’ readiness to push around boys who assume
the one-down position.</p>
<p>At first glance, it would seem that only the powerful can get away
with bald commands such as, “Have that report on my desk by noon.” But
power in an organization also can lead to requests so indirect that they
don’t sound like requests at all. A boss who says, “Do we have the sales
data by product line for each region?” would be surprised and frustrated
if a subordinate responded, “We probably do” rather than “I’ll get it
for you.” Examples such as these notwithstanding, many researchers have
claimed that those in subordinate positions are more likely to speak
indirectly, and that is surely accurate in some situations. For example,
linguist Charlotte Linde examined the black-box conversations that took
place between pilots and copilots before airplane crashes.4 In one
particularly tragic instance, an Air Florida plane crashed into the
Potomac River immediately after attempting takeoff from National Airport
in Washington, D.C., killing all but 5 of the 74 people on board. The
pilot, it turned out, had little experience flying in icy weather. The
copilot had a bit more, and it became heartbreakingly clear on analysis
that he had tried to warn the pilot but had done so indirectly. Alerted
by Linde’s observation, I examined the transcript of the conversations
and found evidence of her hypothesis. The copilot repeatedly called
attention to the bad weather and to ice buildup on other planes:</p>
<p>Copilot: Look how the ice is just hanging on his, ah, back, back
there, see that? See all those icicles on the back there and
everything?</p>
<p>Pilot: Yeah.</p>
<p>[The copilot also expressed concern about the long waiting time since
deicing.]</p>
<p>Copilot: Boy, this is a, this is a losing battle here on trying to
deice those things; it [gives] you a false feeling of security, that’s
all that does. [Just before they took off, the copilot expressed another
concern—about abnormal instrument readings—but again he didn’t press the
matter when it wasn’t picked up by the pilot.]</p>
<p>Copilot: That don’t seem right, does it? [3-second pause]. Ah, that’s
not right. Well—</p>
<p>Pilot: Yes it is, there’s 80.</p>
<p>Copilot: Naw, I don’t think that’s right. [7-second pause] Ah, maybe
it is.</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, the plane took off, with tragic results. In other
instances, as well as this one, Linde observed that copilots, who are
second in command, are more likely to express themselves indirectly or
otherwise mitigate, or soften, their communication when they are
suggesting courses of action to the pilot. In an effort to avert similar
disasters, some airlines now offer training for copilots to express
themselves in more assertive ways.</p>
<p>This solution seems self-evidently appropriate to most Americans. But
when I assigned Linde’s article in a graduate seminar I taught, a
Japanese student pointed out that it would be just as effective to train
pilots to pick up on hints. This approach reflects assumptions about
communication that typify Japanese culture, which places great value on
the ability of people to understand one another without putting
everything into words. Either directness or indirectness can be a
successful means of communication as long as the linguistic style is
understood by the participants.</p>
<p>In the world of work, however, there is more at stake than whether
the communication is understood. People in powerful positions are likely
to reward styles similar to their own, because we all tend to take as
self-evident the logic of our own styles. Accordingly, there is evidence
that in the U.S. workplace, where instructions from a superior are
expected to be voiced in a relatively direct manner, those who tend to
be indirect when telling subordinates what to do may be perceived as
lacking in confidence.</p>
<p>Consider the case of the manager at a national magazine who was
responsible for giving assignments to reporters. She tended to phrase
her assignments as questions. For example, she asked, “How would you
like to do the X project with Y?” or said, “I was thinking of putting
you on the X project. Is that okay?” This worked extremely well with her
staff; they liked working for her, and the work got done in an efficient
and orderly manner. But when she had her midyear evaluation with her own
boss, he criticized her for not assuming the proper demeanor with her
staff.</p>
<p>In any work environment, the higher-ranking person has the power to
enforce his or her view of appropriate demeanor, created in part by
linguistic style. In most U.S. contexts, that view is likely to assume
that the person in authority has the right to be relatively direct
rather than to mitigate orders. There also are cases, however, in which
the higher-ranking person assumes a more indirect style. The owner of a
retail operation told her subordinate, a store manager, to do something.
He said he would do it, but a week later he still hadn’t. They were able
to trace the difficulty to the following conversation: She had said,
“The bookkeeper needs help with the billing. How would you feel about
helping her out?” He had said, “Fine.” This conversation had seemed to
be clear and flawless at the time, but it turned out that they had
interpreted this simple exchange in very different ways. She thought he
meant, “Fine, I’ll help the bookkeeper out.” He thought he meant, “Fine,
I’ll think about how I would feel about helping the bookkeeper out.” He
did think about it and came to the conclusion that he had more important
things to do and couldn’t spare the time.</p>
<p>To the owner, “How would you feel about helping the bookkeeper out?”
was an obviously appropriate way to give the order “Help the bookkeeper
out with the billing.” Those who expect orders to be given as bald
imperatives may find such locutions annoying or even misleading. But
those for whom this style is natural do not think they are being
indirect. They believe they are being clear in a polite or respectful
way.</p>
<p>What is atypical in this example is that the person with the more
indirect style was the boss, so the store manager was motivated to adapt
to her style. She still gives orders the same way, but the store manager
now understands how she means what she says. It’s more common in U.S.
business contexts for the highest-ranking people to take a more direct
style, with the result that many women in authority risk being judged by
their superiors as lacking the appropriate demeanor—and, consequently,
lacking confidence.</p>
<p>What to do?</p>
<p>I am often asked, What is the best way to give criticism? or What is
the best way to give orders?—in other words, What is the best way to
communicate? The answer is that there is no one best way. The results of
a given way of speaking will vary depending on the situation, the
culture of the company, the relative rank of speakers, their linguistic
styles, and how those styles interact with one another. Because of all
those influences, any way of speaking could be perfect for communicating
with one person in one situation and disastrous with someone else in
another. The critical skill for managers is to become aware of the
workings and power of linguistic style, to make sure that people with
something valuable to contribute get heard.</p>
<p>It may seem, for example, that running a meeting in an unstructured
way gives equal opportunity to all. But awareness of the differences in
conversational style makes it easy to see the potential for unequal
access. Those who are comfortable speaking up in groups, who need little
or no silence before raising their hands, or who speak out easily
without waiting to be recognized are far more likely to get heard at
meetings. Those who refrain from talking until it’s clear that the
previous speaker is finished, who wait to be recognized, and who are
inclined to link their comments to those of others will do fine at a
meeting where everyone else is following the same rules but will have a
hard time getting heard in a meeting with people whose styles are more
like the first pattern. Given the socialization typical of boys and
girls, men are more likely to have learned the first style and women the
second, making meetings more congenial for men than for women. It’s
common to observe women who participate actively in one-on-one
discussions or in all-female groups but who are seldom heard in meetings
with a large proportion of men. On the other hand, there are women who
share the style more common among men, and they run a different risk—of
being seen as too aggressive.</p>
<p>A manager aware of those dynamics might devise any number of ways of
ensuring that everyone’s ideas are heard and credited. Although no
single solution will fit all contexts, managers who understand the
dynamics of linguistic style can develop more adaptive and flexible
approaches to running or participating in meetings, mentoring or
advancing the careers of others, evaluating performance, and so on. Talk
is the lifeblood of managerial work, and understanding that different
people have different ways of saying what they mean will make it
possible to take advantage of the talents of people with a broad range
of linguistic styles. As the workplace becomes more culturally diverse
and business becomes more global, managers will need to become even
better at reading interactions and more flexible in adjusting their own
styles to the people with whom they interact.</p>
