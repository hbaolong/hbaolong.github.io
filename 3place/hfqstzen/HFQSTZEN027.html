<h4 id="the-science-behind-the-smile">3 The Science Behind the
Smile</h4>
<p>An interview with Daniel Gilbert by Gardiner Morse</p>
<p>Harvard psychology professor Daniel Gilbert is widely known for his
2006 best seller, Stumbling on Happiness. His work reveals, among other
things, the systematic mistakes we all make in imagining how happy (or
miserable) we’ll be. In this edited interview with HBR’s Gardiner Morse,
Gilbert surveys the field of happiness research and explores its
frontiers.</p>
<p>HBR: Happiness research has become a hot topic in the past 20 years.
Why?</p>
<p>Gilbert: It’s only recently that we realized we could marry one of
our oldest questions—“What is the nature of human happiness?”—to our
newest way of getting answers: science. Until just a few decades ago,
the problem of happiness was mainly in the hands of philosophers and
poets.</p>
<p>Psychologists have always been interested in emotion, but in the past
two decades the study of emotion has exploded, and one of the emotions
that psychologists have studied most intensively is happiness. Recently
economists and neuroscientists joined the party. All these disciplines
have distinct but intersecting interests: Psychologists want to
understand what people feel, economists want to know what people value,
and neuroscientists want to know how people’s brains respond to rewards.
Having three separate disciplines all interested in a single topic has
put that topic on the scientific map. Papers on happiness are published
in Science, people who study happiness win Nobel prizes, and governments
all over the world are rushing to figure out how to measure and increase
the happiness of their citizens.</p>
<p>How is it possible to measure something as subjective as
happiness?</p>
<p>Measuring subjective experiences is a lot easier than you think. It’s
what your eye doctor does when she fits you for glasses. She puts a lens
in front of your eye and asks you to report your experience, and then
she puts another lens up, and then another. She uses your reports as
data, submits the data to scientific analysis, and designs a lens that
will give you perfect vision—all on the basis of your reports of your
subjective experience. People’s real-time reports are very good
approximations of their experiences, and they make it possible for us to
see the world through their eyes. People may not be able to tell us how
happy they were yesterday or how happy they will be tomorrow, but they
can tell us how they’re feeling at the moment we ask them. “How are
you?” may be the world’s most frequently asked question, and nobody’s
stumped by it.</p>
<p>There are many ways to measure happiness. We can ask people “How
happy are you right now?” and have them rate it on a scale. We can use
magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebral blood flow, or
electromyography to measure the activity of the “smile muscles” in the
face. But in most circumstances those measures are highly correlated,
and you’d have to be the federal government to prefer the complicated,
expensive measures over the simple, inexpensive one.</p>
<p>But isn’t the scale itself subjective? Your five might be my six.</p>
<p>Imagine that a drugstore sold a bunch of cheap thermometers that
weren’t very well calibrated. People with normal temperatures might get
readings other than 98.6, and two people with the same temperature might
get different readings. These inaccuracies could cause people to seek
medical treatment they didn’t need or to miss getting treatment they did
need. So buggy thermometers are sometimes a problem—but not always. For
example, if I brought 100 people to my lab, exposed half of them to a
flu virus, and then used those buggy thermometers to take their
temperatures a week later, the average temperature of the people who’d
been exposed would almost surely be higher than the average temperature
of the others. Some thermometers would underestimate, some would
overestimate, but as long as I measured enough people, the inaccuracies
would cancel themselves out. Even with poorly calibrated instruments, we
can compare large groups of people.</p>
<p>A rating scale is like a buggy thermometer. Its inaccuracies make it
inappropriate for some kinds of measurement (for example, saying exactly
how happy John was at 10:42 am on July 3, 2010), but it’s perfectly
appropriate for the kinds of measurements most psychological scientists
make.</p>
<p>What did all these happiness researchers discover?</p>
<p>Much of the research confirms things we’ve always suspected. For
example, in general people who are in good romantic relationships are
happier than those who aren’t. Healthy people are happier than sick
people. People who participate in their churches are happier than those
who don’t. Rich people are happier than poor people. And so on.</p>
<p>That said, there have been some surprises. For example, while all
these things do make people happier, it’s astonishing how little any one
of them matters. Yes, a new house or a new spouse will make you happier,
but not much and not for long. As it turns out, people are not very good
at predicting what will make them happy or how long that happiness will
last. They expect positive events to make them much happier than those
events actually do, and they expect negative events to make them
unhappier than they actually do. In both field and lab studies, we’ve
found that winning or losing an election, gaining or losing a romantic
partner, getting or not getting a promotion, passing or failing an exam
all have less impact on happiness than people think they will. A recent
study showed that very few experiences affect us for more than three
months. When good things happen, we celebrate for a while and then sober
up. When bad things happen, we weep and whine for a while and then pick
ourselves up and get on with it.</p>
<p>Why do events have such a fleeting effect on happiness?</p>
<p>One reason is that people are good at synthesizing happiness—at
finding silver linings. As a result, they usually end up happier than
they expect after almost any kind of trauma or tragedy. Pick up any
newspaper, and you’ll find plenty of examples. Remember Jim Wright, who
resigned in disgrace as Speaker of the House of Representatives because
of a shady book deal? A few years later he told the New York Times that
he was “so much better off, physically, financially, emotionally,
mentally and in almost every other way.” Then there’s Moreese Bickham,
who spent 37 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary; after his
release he said, “I don’t have one minute’s regret. It was a glorious
experience.” These guys appear to be living in the best of all possible
worlds. Speaking of which, Pete Best, the original drummer for the
Beatles, was replaced by Ringo Starr in 1962, just before the Beatles
got big. Now he’s a session drummer. What did he have to say about
missing out on the chance to belong to the most famous band of the 20th
century? “I’m happier than I would have been with the Beatles.”</p>
<p>One of the most reliable findings of the happiness studies is that we
do not have to go running to a therapist every time our shoelaces break.
We have a remarkable ability to make the best of things. Most people are
more resilient than they realize.</p>
<p>Aren’t they deluding themselves? Isn’t real happiness better than
synthetic happiness?</p>
<p>Let’s be careful with terms. Nylon is real; it’s just not natural.
Synthetic happiness is perfectly real; it’s just man-made. Synthetic
happiness is what we produce when we don’t get what we want, and natural
happiness is what we experience when we do. They have different origins,
but they are not necessarily different in terms of how they feel. One is
not obviously better than the other.</p>
<p>Of course, most folks don’t see it that way. Most folks think that
synthetic happiness isn’t as “good” as the other kind—that people who
produce it are just fooling themselves and aren’t really happy. I know
of no evidence demonstrating that that’s the case. If you go blind or
lose a fortune, you’ll find that there’s a whole new life on the other
side of those events. And you’ll find many things about that new life
that are quite good. In fact, you’ll undoubtedly find a few things that
are even better than what you had before. You’re not lying to yourself;
you’re not delusional. You’re discovering things you didn’t
know—couldn’t know—until you were in that new life. You are looking for
things that make your new life better, you are finding them, and they
are making you happy. What is most striking to me as a scientist is that
most of us don’t realize how good we’re going to be at finding these
things. We’d never say, “Oh, of course, if I lost my money or my wife
left me, I’d find a way to be just as happy as I am now.” We’d never say
it—but it’s true.</p>
<p>Is being happy always desirable? Look at all the unhappy creative
geniuses—Beethoven, van Gogh, Hemingway. Doesn’t a certain amount of
unhappiness spur good performance?</p>
<p>Nonsense! Everyone can think of a historical example of someone who
was both miserable and creative, but that doesn’t mean misery generally
promotes creativity. There’s certainly someone out there who smoked two
packs of cigarettes a day and lived to be 90, but that doesn’t mean
cigarettes are good for you. The difference between using anecdotes to
prove a point and using science to prove a point is that in science you
can’t just cherry-pick the story that suits you best. You have to
examine all the stories, or at least take a fair sample of them, and see
if there are more miserable creatives or happy creatives, more miserable
noncreatives or happy noncreatives. If misery promoted creativity, you’d
see a higher percentage of creatives among the miserable than among the
delighted. And you don’t. By and large, happy people are more creative
and more productive. Has there ever been a human being whose misery was
the source of his creativity? Of course. But that person is the
exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>Many managers would say that contented people aren’t the most
productive employees, so you want to keep people a little uncomfortable,
maybe a little anxious, about their jobs.</p>
<p>Managers who collect data instead of relying on intuition don’t say
that. I know of no data showing that anxious, fearful employees are more
creative or productive. Remember, contentment doesn’t mean sitting and
staring at the wall. That’s what people do when they’re bored, and
people hate being bored. We know that people are happiest when they’re
appropriately challenged—when they’re trying to achieve goals that are
difficult but not out of reach. Challenge and threat are not the same
thing. People blossom when challenged and wither when threatened. Sure,
you can get results from threats: Tell someone, “If you don’t get this
to me by Friday, you’re fired,” and you’ll probably have it by Friday.
But you’ll also have an employee who will thereafter do his best to
undermine you, who will feel no loyalty to the organization, and who
will never do more than he must. It would be much more effective to tell
your employee, “I don’t think most people could get this done by Friday.
But I have full faith and confidence that you can. And it’s hugely
important to the entire team.” Psychologists have studied reward and
punishment for a century, and the bottom line is perfectly clear: Reward
works better.</p>
<p>So challenge makes people happy. What else do we know now about the
sources of happiness?</p>
<p>If I had to summarize all the scientific literature on the causes of
human happiness in one word, that word would be “social.” We are by far
the most social species on Earth. Even ants have nothing on us. If I
wanted to predict your happiness, and I could know only one thing about
you, I wouldn’t want to know your gender, religion, health, or income.
I’d want to know about your social network—about your friends and family
and the strength of your bonds with them.</p>
<p>Beyond having rich networks, what makes us happy day to day?</p>
<p>The psychologist Ed Diener has a finding I really like. He
essentially shows that the frequency of your positive experiences is a
much better predictor of your happiness than is the intensity of your
positive experiences. When we think about what would make us happy, we
tend to think of intense events—going on a date with a movie star,
winning a Pulitzer, buying a yacht. But Diener and his colleagues have
shown that how good your experiences are doesn’t matter nearly as much
as how many good experiences you have. Somebody who has a dozen mildly
nice things happen each day is likely to be happier than somebody who
has a single truly amazing thing happen. So wear comfortable shoes, give
your wife a big kiss, sneak a french fry. It sounds like small stuff,
and it is. But the small stuff matters.</p>
<p>I think this helps explain why it’s so hard for us to forecast our
affective states. We imagine that one or two big things will have a
profound effect. But it looks like happiness is the sum of hundreds of
small things. Achieving happiness requires the same approach as losing
weight. People trying to lose weight want a magic pill that will give
them instant results. Ain’t no such thing. We know exactly how people
lose weight: They eat less and exercise more. They don’t have to eat
much less or exercise much more—they just have to do those things
consistently. Over time it adds up. Happiness is like that. The things
you can do to increase your happiness are obvious and small and take
just a little time. But you have to do them every day and wait for the
results.</p>
<p>What are those little things we can do to increase our happiness?</p>
<p>They won’t surprise you any more than “eat less and exercise more”
does. The main things are to commit to some simple behaviors—meditating,
exercising, getting enough sleep—and to practice altruism. One of the
most selfish things you can do is help others. Volunteer at a homeless
shelter. You may or may not help the homeless, but you will almost
surely help yourself. And nurture your social connections. Twice a week,
write down three things you’re grateful for, and tell someone why. I
know these sound like homilies from your grandmother. Well, your
grandmother was smart. The secret of happiness is like the secret of
weight loss: It’s not a secret!</p>
<p>If there’s no secret, what’s left to study?</p>
<p>There’s no shortage of questions. For decades psychologists and
economists have been asking, “Who’s happy? The rich? The poor? The
young? The old?” The best we could do was divide people into groups,
survey them once or maybe twice, and try to determine if the people in
one group were, on average, happier than those in the others. The tools
we used were pretty blunt instruments. But now millions of people are
carrying little computers in their pockets—smartphones—and this allows
us to collect data in real time from huge numbers of people about what
they are doing and feeling from moment to moment. That’s never been
possible before.</p>
<p>One of my collaborators, Matt Killingsworth, has built an
experience-sampling application called Track Your Happiness. He follows
more than 15,000 people by iPhone, querying them several times a day
about their activities and emotional states. Are they at home? On a bus?
Watching television? Praying? How are they feeling? What are they
thinking about? With this technology, Matt’s beginning to answer a much
better question than the one we’ve been asking for decades. Instead of
asking who is happy, he can ask when they are happy. He doesn’t get the
answer by asking, “When are you happy?”—because frankly, people don’t
know. He gets it by tracking people over days, months, and years and
measuring what they are doing and how happy they are while they are
doing it. I think this kind of technology is about to revolutionize our
understanding of daily emotions and human well-being. (See the sidebar
“The Future of Happiness Research.”)</p>
<p>What are the new frontiers of happiness research?</p>
<p>We need to get more specific about what we are measuring. Many
scientists say they are studying happiness, but when you look at what
they’re measuring, you find they are actually studying depression or
life satisfaction. These things are related to happiness, of course, but
they are not the same as happiness. Research shows that people with
children are typically less happy on a moment-to-moment basis than
people without children. But people who have kids may feel fulfilled in
a way that people without kids do not. It doesn’t make sense to say that
people with kids are happier, or that people without kids are happier;
each group is happier in some ways and less happy in others. We need to
stop painting our portrait of happiness with such a fat brush.</p>
<p>Will all this research ultimately make us happier?</p>
<p>We are learning and will continue to learn how to maximize our
happiness. So yes, there is no doubt that the research has helped and
will continue to help us increase our happiness. But that still leaves
the big question: What kind of happiness should we want? For example, do
we want the average happiness of our moments to be as large as possible,
or do we want the sum of our happy moments to be as large as possible?
Those are different things. Do we want lives free of pain and heartache,
or is there value in those experiences? Science will soon be able to
tell us how to live the lives we want, but it will never tell us what
kinds of lives we should want to live. That will be for us to
decide.</p>
<p>THE FUTURE OF HAPPINESS RESEARCH</p>
<p>by Matthew Killingsworth</p>
<p>You’d think it would be easy to figure out what makes us happy. Until
recently, though, researchers have had to rely mainly on people’s
reports about their average emotional states over long periods of time
and on easily surveyed predictors of happiness, such as demographic
variables. As a result, we know that married or wealthy people are, on
average, happier than unmarried or less-well-off people. But what is it
about being married or having money that makes people happy?</p>
<p>Focusing on average emotional states also smoothes out short-term
fluctuations in happiness and consequently diminishes our ability to
understand the causes of those fluctuations. For example, how do the
moment-by-moment details of a person’s day affect that person’s
happiness?</p>
<p>We can now begin to answer questions like these, thanks to the
smartphone. For an ongoing research project called Track Your Happiness,
I have recruited more than 15,000 people in 83 countries to report their
emotional states in real time, using devices they carry with them every
day. I created an iPhone web app that queries users at random intervals,
asking them about their mood (respondents slide a button along a scale
that ranges from “very bad” to “very good”), what they are doing (they
can select from 22 options, including commuting, working, exercising,
and eating), and factors such as their level of productivity, the nature
of their environment, the amount and quality of their sleep, and their
social interactions. Since 2009 we have collected more than half a
million data points—making this, to my knowledge, the first-ever
large-scale study of happiness in daily life.</p>
<p>One major finding is that people’s minds wander nearly half the time,
and this appears to lower their mood. Wandering to unpleasant or even
neutral topics is associated with sharply lower happiness; straying to
positive topics has no effect either way. The amount of mind-wandering
varies greatly depending on the activity, from roughly 60% of the time
while commuting to 30% when talking to someone or playing a game to 10%
during sex. But no matter what people are doing, they are much less
happy when their minds are wandering than when their minds are
focused.</p>
<p>All of this strongly suggests that to optimize our emotional
well-being, we should pay at least as much attention to where our minds
are as to what our bodies are doing. Yet for most of us, the focus of
our thoughts isn’t part of our daily planning. When you wake up on a
Saturday morning and ask, “What am I going to do today?” the answer is
usually about where you’ll take your body—to the beach, to the kids’
soccer practice, for a run. You ought to also ask, “What am I going to
do with my mind today?”</p>
<p>A related stream of research examines the relationship between
mind-wandering and productivity. Many managers, particularly those whose
employees do creative knowledge work, may sense that a certain amount of
daydreaming is a good thing, providing a mental break and perhaps
leading people to reflect on related work matters. Unfortunately, the
data so far suggest that, in addition to reducing happiness,
mind-wandering on the job reduces productivity. And employees’ minds
stray much more than managers probably imagine—about 50% of the
workday—and almost always veer toward personal concerns. Managers may
want to look for ways to help employees stay focused, for the employees’
and the company’s sakes.</p>
<p>The data are also beginning to paint a picture of variations in
happiness within an individual and from one individual to the next. The
most striking finding here is that happiness differs more from moment to
moment than it does from person to person. This suggests that it’s not
the stable conditions of our lives, such as where we live or whether
we’re married, that are the principal drivers of happiness; it could be
the small, everyday things that count the most.</p>
<p>It also suggests that happiness on the job may depend more on our
moment-to-moment experiences—our routine interactions with coworkers,
the projects we’re involved in, our daily contributions—than on the
stable conditions thought to promote happiness, such as a high salary or
a prestigious title. A priority of my current and future research is to
deploy this tracking technology in the workplace and, I hope, at last
reveal what actually makes employees happy.</p>
<p>A focused mind is a happy mind</p>
<p>Participants were queried about mood and mind-wandering during 22
activities. The balls represent their activities and thoughts. The
farther to the right a ball is, the happier people were, on average. The
larger the ball, the more frequently they engaged in the activity or
thought.</p>
