Focus Your Energy During a Work Crunch</h4>
<p>By Amy Jen Su</p>
<p>Work invariably ebbs and flows, cycling between steady states, where
we feel more in control of the pace and workload, and peak periods,
where the work crunch hits us hard. Unexpected setbacks, project
sprints, or even vacations and holidays can create mayhem and tension.
Maintaining focus and managing energy levels become critical as tasks
pile onto an already full load. When you’re in your next work crunch,
there are a few things you can do to focus and manage your energy more
productively.</p>
<p>Accept the situation</p>
<p>When an acute period hits, it’s easy to resist the fact that it’s
happening. We wish for things to be like they were last month, or we
long for the pace we had during vacation. By not being present to the
here and now, we drain our energy by ruminating on the situation. In
fact, physicists define resistance as “the degree to which a substance
or device opposes the passage of an electrical current, causing energy
dissipation.” In the case of a work crunch, the more you oppose what’s
happening, the more energy you’ll lose. Acceptance does not mean giving
in.1 On the contrary, it means acknowledging the reality of the
situation with awareness so that you can take clear action.</p>
<p>Observe and label your underlying emotions</p>
<p>Acceptance is particularly difficult given the underlying emotions
that an acute work crunch can bring. Negative thoughts such as I’m not
going to do a good job, I don’t know if I’ll be able to get it all done,
or I feel like I’m dropping the ball at both home and work often
predominate. David Rock, director of the Neuro-Leadership Institute,
suggests in his book Your Brain at Work that rather than suppressing or
denying an emotion, an effective cognitive technique is labeling,
whereby you take a situation and put a label on your emotions.2 “The
most successful executives have developed an ability to be in a state of
high limbic system arousal and still remain calm,” Rock says. “Partly,
this is their ability to label emotion states.”</p>
<p>The next time you are in a tough work crunch or you’re experiencing a
setback at work, take Rock’s advice to step back, observe your thinking
and emotional state, and assign a word to what’s happening, such as
“pressure,” “guilt,” or “worry.” By using just one or two words, Rock’s
research shows, you can reduce the arousal of the limbic brain’s
fight-or-flight system and instead activate the prefrontal cortex, which
is responsible for our executive functioning skills.</p>
<p>Preserve your sense of choice and agency</p>
<p>Accepting the situation and labeling our emotions can help reduce the
anxiety that comes with a work crunch. This is critical, because, as
research out of the University of Pittsburgh shows, anxiety directly
impacts our cognitive functioning, especially areas that are responsible
for making sound decisions.3 Don’t fall into a victim mentality, in
which you believe that there are no choices or that you don’t have
control. Instead, bring greater vigilance to assessing your priorities,
making tough trade-offs, and incorporating self-care where you can. For
example, ask yourself:</p>
<p>What are the one or two things that are mission critical today?</p>
<p>What is something I can do to recharge my batteries (get to bed early
one night this week, listen to my favorite music while working, or catch
a nap on a plane)?</p>
<p>Who or what will I have to say no to during this time?</p>
<p>Communicate with your colleagues and loved ones</p>
<p>People can be a real energy drain—or gain—during work crunches and
setbacks. Pause and consider how you can renegotiate deadlines, set
tighter boundaries, or ask for more support during this time. Here are
some suggestions.</p>
<p>Renegotiate deadlines. Loop back with colleagues to ensure that you
understand when someone really needs something and is going to review
it. In other cases, if you anticipate not being able to meet a deadline,
be sure to inform your colleagues of the new timing, or renegotiate it.
Keep your integrity by doing what you say you’re going to do and by
being up front when you need to shift gears.</p>
<p>Set tighter boundaries. Our boundaries and guardrails need to change
during work crunches or acute periods. Let others in your life, both
professionally and personally, know when you’ll be available or not, so
they will be aware of your more-limited schedule.</p>
<p>Ask for help and support. Many of us pride ourselves on not bothering
others and being self-reliant. These are great qualities, but there are
times when we need to ask for help. In such times, ask your loved ones
for more help on the home front. Share the weight of the accountability
for projects with your colleagues by delegating or teaming up, instead
of trying to do it all on your own.</p>
<p>Practice self-compassion</p>
<p>Probably the toughest thing of all during a work crunch or setback is
how easy it is to beat yourself up—especially when you aren’t hitting
your own high standards for work or time at home. Annie McKee, author of
the book How to Be Happy at Work and coauthor of several books on
emotional intelligence, says this about self-compassion: “If you really
want to deal with stress, you’ve got to stop trying to be a hero and
start caring for and about yourself.”4</p>
<p>To be truly self-compassionate, especially during an acute period of
work stress, accept the situation by acknowledging it with awareness and
compassion, observe and label your emotions (don’t suppress or deny
them), preserve your sense of choice and agency, communicate with your
colleagues and loved ones, and ask for help when you need it. By taking
these actions, you’ll move through your next crunch with greater ease
and peace.</p>
