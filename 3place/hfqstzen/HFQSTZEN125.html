Feeling Powerful at Work Makes Us Feel Worse When We Get Home</h4>
<p>By Trevor A. Foulk and Klodiana Lanaj</p>
<p>Have you ever interacted with a supervisor who was on a power trip
and come away feeling disrespected, hurt, or upset? You’re far from
alone. Abundant research shows that when people feel powerful, they tend
to abuse others, supporting the notion that “power tends to corrupt, and
absolute power corrupts absolutely.”1 Many studies show that abused
employees suffer distress, perform worse, are less creative, and are
more likely to quit their jobs.2 Abusive power holders, on the other
hand, seem immune to their own negative behaviors: Research suggests
that they continue about their day as if nothing has happened.</p>
<p>But what if this isn’t the entire story? What if power comes at a
cost for powerful leaders, too?</p>
<p>We investigate this possibility in a study of 108 managers, whom we
surveyed for 10 consecutive workdays.3 These managers worked in
different organizations in industries including health care,
engineering, education, and banking. Although the leaders had some
degree of structural power, research suggests that one’s sense of power
fluctuates daily and can be triggered by certain events (for example,
reminders of being in charge, attending a meeting for management, or
making a hiring or firing decision). To manipulate daily power, we
randomly assigned participants to five “power days” and five control
days. On power days managers were asked to think and write about a time
when they had power over someone else and to complete several short word
exercises (such as “Complete the following word fragment with the first
real word that comes to mind: p_w_r”). Research shows that both of these
techniques activate a sense of power. On control days managers completed
similar exercises that did not prime power. For example, they described
their commute to work that day and completed neutral sentences
(“Complete the following word fragment with the first real word that
comes to mind: i_la_d”).</p>
<p>Participants interacted with their coworkers, managers, and customers
over the course of the study, which gave us ample opportunities to
assess the leaders’ behaviors multiple times each day, both at work and
at home. We emailed survey links to participants three times each day:
We manipulated power with the morning survey, which participants
completed at approximately 8:28 a.m.; we assessed daily abuse and
perceived incivility from others at the end of the workday, at
approximately 5:23 p.m.; we measured relaxation and need fulfillment at
home at approximately 8:24 p.m.</p>
<p>Consistent with literature supporting the corrupting nature of power,
we found that on days when participants felt powerful, they reported
having more negative interactions with others. These negative inter
actions came in two forms: Participants reported engaging in more
abusive behaviors toward others (they yelled or swore more, behaved in a
rude manner, or made fun of coworkers), but they also perceived more
incivility from others (they felt that coworkers addressed them more
unprofessionally, talked to them in a condescending tone, and paid
little attention to their statements and opinions). These findings are
well aligned with prior research on the effects of psychological power.
Power causes us to view others as psychologically distant,
inconsequential, and as a means to our ends, all of which explain why
power enhances abuse. At the same time, psychological power makes us
feel special and more deserving of others’ attention, respect, and
favor. These inflated expectations often are not met, which may explain
why power holders experience more incivility from others.</p>
<p>Although our findings depict a rather bleak picture for the effects
that power has on leaders, there are several silver linings. First, not
everyone was affected by psychological power to the same degree. For
example, using a personality survey, we measured leaders’ trait-level
agreeableness and found that agreeable leaders abused others less when
experiencing power. Agreeable people care about others’ well-being and
make it a priority to maintain positive relationships with coworkers.
Their innate desire to maintain social harmony may explain why agreeable
leaders do not engage in as much abuse when they experience power. The
absolute corrupting nature of power, therefore, may not be as absolute
as we have come to believe.</p>
<p>Second, power holders were hurt by their own bad behaviors. When we
surveyed leaders in the evening, at home, we noticed that powerful
leaders who engaged in abuse and who perceived more incivility from
others reported feeling less fulfilled by their workday—they felt less
competent, less able to relate to others, and less autonomous.
Additionally, abusive power holders were less able to kick back and
relax at home. These findings suggest a “power hangover”—the effects of
power experienced during the workday reduced leaders’ well-being in the
evening at home. Overall, our power manipulation accounted for 15% of a
manager’s daily variability in need fulfillment and 2% of their
variability in relaxation, suggesting that even a minor manipulation of
power in the morning can have noticeable effects on well-being that last
until the evening.</p>
<p>Why does power hurt leaders’ well-being, even at home? One reason
might be that power-induced negative interactions threaten leaders’
ability to maintain power over others at work; abused followers may
retaliate or may not comply with abusive leaders’ demands in the future.
It is also possible that powerful leaders who reflect on their negative
behaviors at home may feel guilty because they recognize that they
violated social norms for proper work conduct.</p>
<p>Although many people would prefer to have more power and influence,
our study shows that power not only prompts us to do bad things but can
also make us feel worse at home. It is prudent, therefore, to temper our
rosy view of power and to start considering its costs as well.</p>
<p>It is important for people in positions of power to become aware of
the negative influence that power can have on our interactions with
others, as well as on our own well-being. It may help to ask trusted
mentors and colleagues to keep us accountable for how we behave at work.
From an organizational perspective, it could be helpful to assign
agreeable employees to powerful roles, because agreeable leaders are
less susceptible to power-induced abuse.</p>
<p>It’s often said that “with great power comes great responsibility.”
As we show in this study, greater power also seems to come with greater
suffering.</p>
