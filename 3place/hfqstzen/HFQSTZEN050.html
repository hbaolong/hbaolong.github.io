<h4 id="taking-the-stress-out-of-stressful-conversations">2 Taking the
Stress Out of Stressful Conversations</h4>
<p>By Holly Weeks</p>
<p>We live by talking. That’s just the kind of animal we are. We chatter
and tattle and gossip and jest. But sometimes—more often than we’d
like—we have stressful conversations, those sensitive exchanges that can
hurt or haunt us in ways no other kind of talking does. Stressful
conversations are unavoidable in life, and in business they can run the
gamut from firing a subordinate to, curiously enough, receiving praise.
But whatever the context, stressful conversations differ from other
conversations because of the emotional loads they carry. These
conversations call up embarrassment, confusion, anxiety, anger, pain, or
fear—if not in us, then in our counterparts. Indeed, stressful
conversations cause such anxiety that most people simply avoid them.
This strategy is not necessarily wrong. One of the first rules of
engagement, after all, is to pick your battles. Yet sometimes it can be
extremely costly to dodge issues, appease difficult people, and smooth
over antagonisms because the fact is that avoidance usually makes a
problem or relationship worse.</p>
<p>Since stressful conversations are so common—and so painful—why don’t
we work harder to improve them? The reason is precisely because our
feelings are so enmeshed. When we are not emotionally entangled in an
issue, we know that conflict is normal, that it can be resolved—or at
least managed. But when feelings get stirred up, most of us are thrown
off balance. Like a quarterback who chokes in a tight play, we lose all
hope of ever making it to the goal line.</p>
<p>For the past 20 years, I have been teaching classes and conducting
workshops at some of the top corporations and universities in the United
States on how to communicate during stressful conversations. With
classrooms as my laboratory, I have learned that most people feel
incapable of talking through sensitive issues. It’s as though all our
skills go out the window and we can’t think usefully about what’s
happening or what we could do to get good results.</p>
<p>Stressful conversations, though, need not be this way. I have seen
that managers can improve difficult conversations unilaterally if they
approach them with greater self-awareness, rehearse them in advance, and
apply just three proven communication techniques. Don’t misunderstand
me: There will never be a cookie-cutter approach to stressful
conversations. There are too many variables and too much tension, and
the interactions between people in difficult situations are always
unique. Yet nearly every stressful conversation can be seen as an
amalgam of a limited number of basic conversations, each with its own
distinct set of problems. In the following pages, we’ll explore how you
can anticipate and handle those problems. But first, let’s look at the
three basic stressful conversations that we bump up against most often
in the workplace.</p>
<p>“I have bad news for you”</p>
<p>Delivering unpleasant news is usually difficult for both parties. The
speaker is often tense, and the listener is apprehensive about where the
conversation is headed. Consider David, the director of a nonprofit
institution. He was in the uncomfortable position of needing to talk
with an ambitious researcher, Jeremy, who had a much higher opinion of
his job performance than others in the organization did. The
complication for David was that, in the past, Jeremy had received
artificially high evaluations. There were several reasons for this. One
had to do with the organization’s culture: The nonprofit was not a
confrontational kind of place. Additionally, Jeremy had tremendous
confidence in both his own abilities and the quality of his academic
background. Together with his defensive response to even the mildest
criticism, this confidence led others—including David—to let slide
discussions of weaknesses that were interfering with Jeremy’s ability to
deliver high-quality work. Jeremy had a cutting sense of humor, for
instance, which had offended people inside and outside his unit. No one
had ever said anything to him directly, but as time passed, more and
more people were reluctant to work with him. Given that Jeremy had
received almost no concrete criticism over the years, his biting style
was now entrenched and the staff was restive.</p>
<p>In conversations like this, the main challenge is to get off to the
right start. If the exchange starts off reasonably well, the rest of it
has a good chance of going well. But if the opening goes badly, it
threatens to bleed forward into the rest of the conversation. In an
effort to be gentle, many people start these conversations on a light
note. And that was just what David did, opening with, “How about those
Red Sox?”</p>
<p>Naturally Jeremy got the wrong idea about where David was heading; he
remained his usual cocky, superior self. Sensing this, David felt he had
to take off the velvet gloves. The conversation quickly became brutally
honest, and David did almost all the talking. When the monologue was
over, Jeremy stared icily at the floor. He got up in stiff silence and
left. David was relieved. From his point of view, the interaction had
been painful but swift. There was not too much blood on the floor, he
observed wryly. But two days later, Jeremy handed in his resignation,
taking a lot of institutional memory—and talent—with him.</p>
<p>“What’s going on here?”</p>
<p>Often we have stressful conversations thrust upon us. Indeed, some of
the worst conversations—especially for people who are conflict
averse—are the altogether unexpected ones that break out like crackling
summer storms. Suddenly the conversation becomes intensely charged
emotionally, and electricity flies in all directions. What’s worse,
nothing makes sense. We seem to have been drawn into a black cloud of
twisted logic and altered sensibilities.</p>
<p>Consider the case of Elizabeth and Rafael. They were team leaders
working together on a project for a major consulting firm. It seemed
that everything that could have gone wrong on the project had, and the
work was badly bogged down. The two consultants were meeting to revise
their schedule, given the delays, and to divide up the discouraging
tasks for the week ahead. As they talked, Elizabeth wrote and erased on
the white board. When she had finished, she looked at Rafael and said
matter-of-factly, “Is that it, then?”</p>
<p>Rafael clenched his teeth in frustration. “If you say so,” he
sniped.</p>
<p>Elizabeth recoiled. She instantly replayed the exchange in her mind
but couldn’t figure out what had provoked Rafael. His reaction seemed
completely disconnected from her comment. The most common reaction of
someone in Elizabeth’s place is to guiltily defend herself by denying
Rafael’s unspoken accusation. But Elizabeth was uneasy with
confrontation so she tried appeasement. “Rafael,” she stammered, “I’m
sorry. Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“Who put you in charge?” he retorted. “Who told you to assign work to
me?”</p>
<p>Clearly, Rafael and Elizabeth have just happened into a difficult
conversation. Some transgression has occurred, but Elizabeth doesn’t
know exactly what it is. She feels blindsided—her attempt to expedite
the task at hand has clearly been misconstrued. Rafael feels he’s been
put in a position of inferiority by what he sees as Elizabeth’s
controlling behavior. Inexplicably, there seem to be more than two
people taking part in this conversation, and the invisible parties are
creating lots of static. What childhood experience, we may wonder, is
causing Elizabeth to assume that Rafael’s tension is automatically her
fault? And who is influencing Rafael’s perception that Elizabeth is
taking over? Could it be his father? His wife? It’s impossible to tell.
At the same time, it’s hard for us to escape the feeling that Rafael is
overreacting when he challenges Elizabeth about her alleged need to take
control.</p>
<p>Elizabeth felt Rafael’s resentment like a wave, and she apologized
again. “Sorry. How do you want the work divided?” Deferring to Rafael in
this way smoothed the strained atmosphere for the time being. But it set
a precedent for unequal status that neither Elizabeth nor the company
believed was correct. Worse, though Rafael and Elizabeth remained on the
same team after their painful exchange, Elizabeth chafed under the
status change and three months later transferred out of the project.</p>
<p>“You are attacking me!”</p>
<p>Now let’s turn our attention to aggressively stressful conversations,
those in which people use all kinds of psychological and rhetorical
mechanisms to throw their counterparts off balance, to undermine their
positions, even to expose and belittle them. These “thwarting tactics”
take many forms—profanity, manipulation, shouting—and not everyone is
triggered or stumped by the same ones. The red zone is not the thwarting
tactic alone but the pairing of the thwarting tactic with individual
vulnerability.</p>
<p>Consider Nick and Karen, two senior managers working at the same
level in an IT firm. Karen was leading a presentation to a client, and
the information was weak and disorganized. She and the team had not been
able to answer even basic questions. The client had been patient, then
quiet, then clearly exasperated. When the presentation really started to
fall apart, the client put the team on the spot with questions that made
them look increasingly inadequate.</p>
<p>On this particular day, Nick was not part of the presenting team; he
was simply observing. He was as surprised as the client at Karen’s poor
performance. After the client left, he asked Karen what happened. She
lashed out at him defensively: “You’re not my boss, so don’t start
patronizing me. You always under cut me no matter what I do.” Karen
continued to shout at Nick, her antagonism palpable. Each time he spoke,
she interrupted him with accusations and threats: “I can’t wait to see
how you like it when people leave you flailing in the wind.” Nick tried
to remain reasonable, but Karen didn’t wind down. “Karen,” he said,
“pull yourself together. You are twisting every word I say.”</p>
<p>Here, Nick’s problem is not that Karen is using a panoply of
thwarting tactics but that all her tactics—accusation, distortion, and
digression—are aggressive. This raises the stakes considerably. Most of
us are vulnerable to aggressive tactics because we don’t know whether,
or how far, the aggression will escalate. Nick wanted to avoid Karen’s
aggression, but his insistence on rationality in the face of
emotionalism was not working. His cool approach was trumped by Karen’s
aggressive one. As a result, Nick found himself trapped in the snare of
Karen’s choosing. In particular, her threats that she would pay him back
with the client rattled him. He couldn’t tell whether she was just
huffing or meant it. He finally turned to the managing director, who
grew frustrated and later angry at Nick and Karen for their inability to
resolve their problems. In the end, their lack of skill in handling
their difficult conversations cost them dearly. Both were passed over
for promotion after the company pinned the loss of the client directly
on their persistent failure to communicate.</p>
<p>Preparing for a stressful conversation</p>
<p>So how can we prepare for these three basic stressful conversations
before they occur? A good start is to become aware of your own
weaknesses to people and situations. David, Elizabeth, and Nick were
unable to control their counterparts, but their stressful conversations
would have gone much better if they had been more usefully aware of
their vulnerabilities. It is important for those who are vulnerable to
hostility, for example, to know how they react to it. Do they withdraw
or escalate? Do they clam up or retaliate? While one reaction is not
better than the other, knowing how you react in a stressful situation
will teach you a lot about your vulnerabilities, and it can help you
master stressful situations.</p>
<p>Recall Nick’s problem. If he had been more self-aware, he would have
known that he acts stubbornly rational in the face of aggressive
outbursts such as Karen’s. Nick’s choice of a disengaged demeanor gave
Karen control over the conversation, but he didn’t have to allow
Karen—or anyone else—to exploit his vulnerability. In moments of calm
self-scrutiny, when he’s not entangled in a live stressful conversation,
Nick can take time to reflect on his inability to tolerate irrational
aggressive outbursts. This self-awareness would free him to prepare
himself—not for Karen’s unexpected accusations but for his own
predictable vulnerability to any sudden assault like hers.</p>
<p>Though it might sound like it, building awareness is not about
endless self-analysis. Much of it simply involves making our tacit
knowledge about ourselves more explicit. We all know from past
experience, for instance, what kinds of conversations and people we
handle badly. When you find yourself in a difficult conversation, ask
yourself whether this is one of those situations and whether it involves
one of those people. For instance, do you bare your teeth when faced
with an overbearing competitor? Do you shut down when you feel excluded?
Once you know what your danger zones are, you can anticipate your
vulnerability and improve your response.</p>
<p>Explicit self-awareness will often help save you from engaging in a
conversation in a way that panders to your feelings rather than one that
serves your needs. Think back to David, the boss of the nonprofit
institution, and Jeremy, his cocky subordinate. Given Jeremy’s history,
David’s conversational game plan—easing in, then when that didn’t work,
the painful-but-quick bombshell—was doomed. A better approach would have
been for David to split the conversation into two parts. In a first
meeting, he could have raised the central issues of Jeremy’s biting
humor and disappointing performance. A second meeting could have been
set up for the discussion itself. Handling the situation incrementally
would have allowed time for both David and Jeremy to prepare for a
two-way conversation instead of one of them delivering a monologue.
After all, this wasn’t an emergency; David didn’t have to exhaust this
topic immediately. Indeed, if David had been more self-aware, he might
have recognized that the approach he chose was dictated less by Jeremy’s
character than by his own distaste for conflict.</p>
<p>An excellent way to anticipate specific problems that you may
encounter in a stressful conversation is to rehearse with a neutral
friend. Pick someone who doesn’t have the same communication problems as
you. Ideally, the friend should be a good listener, honest but
nonjudgmental. Start with content. Just tell your friend what you want
to say to your counterpart without worrying about tone or phrasing. Be
vicious, be timid, be sarcastically witty, jump around in your argument,
but get it out. Now go over it again and think about what you would say
if the situation weren’t emotionally loaded. Your friend can help you
because he or she is not in a flush of emotion over the situation. Write
down what you come up with together because if you don’t, you’ll forget
it later.</p>
<p>Now fine-tune the phrasing. When you imagine talking to the
counterpart, your phrasing tends to be highly charged—and you can think
of only one way to say anything. But when your friend says, “Tell me how
you want to say this,” an interesting thing happens: Your phrasing is
often much better, much more temperate, usable. Remember, you can say
what you want to say, you just can’t say it like that. Also, work on
your body language with your friend. You’ll both soon be laughing
because of the expressions that sneak out unawares—eyebrows skittering
up and down, legs wrapped around each other like licorice twists,
nervous snickers that will certainly be misinterpreted. (For more on
preparing for stressful conversations, see the sidebar “The DNA of
Conversation Management.”)</p>
<p>THE DNA OF CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>The techniques I have identified for handling stressful conversations
all have tucked within them three deceptively simple ingredients that
are needed to make stressful conversations succeed. These are clarity,
neutrality, and temperance. They are the building blocks of all good
communication. Mastering them will multiply your chances of responding
well to even the most strained conversation. Let’s take a look at each
of the components in turn.</p>
<p>Clarity means letting words do the work for us. Avoid euphemisms or
talking in circles, and tell people clearly what you mean: “Emily, from
your family’s point of view, the Somerset Valley Nursing Home would be
the best placement for your father. His benefits don’t cover it.”
Unfortunately, delivering clear content when the news is bad is
particularly hard to do. Under strained circumstances, we all tend to
shy away from clarity because we equate it with brutality. Instead, we
say things like, “Well, Dan, we’re still not sure yet what’s going to
happen with this job, but in the future we’ll keep our eyes open.” This
is a roundabout—and terribly misleading—way to inform someone that he
didn’t get the promotion he was seeking. And in reality, there’s nothing
inherently brutal about honesty. It is not the content but the delivery
of the news that makes it brutal or humane. Ask a surgeon. Ask a priest;
ask a cop. If a message is given skillfully—even though the news is
bad—the content may still be tolerable. When a senior executive, for
example, directly tells a subordinate that “the promotion has gone to
someone else,” the news is likely to be highly unpleasant, and the
appropriate reaction is sadness, anger, and anxiety. But if the content
is clear, the listener can better begin to process the information.
Indeed, bringing clarity to the content eases the burden for the
recipient rather than increases it.</p>
<p>Tone is the nonverbal part of delivery in stressful conversations. It
is intonation, facial expressions, and conscious and unconscious body
language. Although it’s hard to have a neutral tone when overcome by
strong feelings, neutrality is the desired norm in crisis
communications, including stressful conversations. Consider the classic
neutrality of NASA. Regardless of how dire the message, NASA
communicates its content in uninflected tones: “Houston, we have a
problem.” It takes practice to acquire such neutrality. But a neutral
tone is the best place to start when a conversation turns stressful.</p>
<p>Temperate phrasing is the final element in this triumvirate of
skills. English is a huge language, and there are lots of different ways
to say what you need to say. Some of these phrases are temperate, while
others will baldly provoke the recipient to dismiss your words—and your
content. In the United States, for example, some of the most intemperate
phrasing revolves around threats of litigation: “If you don’t get a
check to me by April 23, I’ll be forced to call my lawyer.” Phrases like
this turn up the heat in all conversations, particularly in strained
ones. But remember, we’re not in stressful conversations to score points
or to create enemies. The goal is to advance the conversation, to hear
and be heard accurately, and to have a functional exchange between two
people. So the next time you want to snap at someone—“Stop interrupting
me!”—try this: “Can you hold on a minute? I want to finish before I lose
my train of thought.” Temperate phrasing will help you take the strain
out of a stressful conversation.</p>
<p>Managing the conversation</p>
<p>While it is important to build awareness and to practice before a
stressful conversation, those steps are not enough. Let’s look at what
you can do as the conversation unfolds. Consider Elizabeth, the team
leader whose colleague claimed she was usurping control. She couldn’t
think well on her feet in confrontational situations, and she knew it,
so she needed a few hip-pocket phrases—phrases she could recall on the
spot so that she wouldn’t have to be silent or invent something on the
spur of the moment. Though such a solution sounds simple, most of us
don’t have a tool kit of conversational tactics ready at hand.
Rectifying this gap is an essential part of learning how to handle
stressful conversations better. We need to learn communications skills,
in the same way that we learn CPR: well in advance, knowing that when we
need to use them, the situation will be critical and tense. Here are
three proven conversational approaches. The particular wording may not
suit your style, and that’s fine. The important thing is to understand
how the techniques work, and then choose phrasing that is comfortable
for you.</p>
<p>Honor thy partner</p>
<p>When David gave negative feedback to Jeremy, it would have been
refreshing if he had begun with an admission of regret and some
responsibility for his contribution to their shared problem. “Jeremy,”
he might have said, “the quality of your work has been undercut—in part
by the reluctance of your colleagues to risk the edge of your humor by
talking problems through with you. I share responsibility for this
because I have been reluctant to speak openly about these difficulties
with you, whom I like and respect and with whom I have worked a long
time.” Acknowledging responsibility as a technique—particularly as an
opening—can be effective because it immediately focuses attention, but
without provocation, on the difficult things the speaker needs to say
and the listener needs to hear.</p>
<p>Is this always a good technique in a difficult conversation? No,
because there is never any one good technique. But in this case, it
effectively sets the tone for David’s discussion with Jeremy. It honors
the problems, it honors Jeremy, it honors their relationship, and it
honors David’s responsibility. Any technique that communicates honor in
a stressful conversation—particularly a conversation that will take the
counterpart by surprise—is to be highly valued. Indeed, the ability to
act with dignity can make or break a stressful conversation. More
important, while Jeremy has left the company, he can still do harm by
spreading gossip and using his insider’s knowledge against the
organization. The more intolerable the conversation with David has been,
the more Jeremy is likely to want to make the organization pay.</p>
<p>Disarm by restating your intentions</p>
<p>Part of the difficulty in Rafael and Elizabeth’s “What’s going on
here?” conversation is that Rafael’s misinterpretation of Elizabeth’s
words and actions seems to be influenced by instant replays of other
stressful conversations that he has had in the past. Elizabeth doesn’t
want to psychoanalyze Rafael; indeed, exploring Rafael’s internal
landscape would exacerbate this painful situation. So what can Elizabeth
do to defuse the situation unilaterally?</p>
<p>Elizabeth needs a technique that doesn’t require her to understand
the underlying reasons for Rafael’s strong reaction but that helps her
handle the situation effectively. “I can see how you took what I said
the way you did, Rafael. That wasn’t what I meant. Let’s go over this
list again.” I call this the clarification technique, and it’s a highly
disarming one. Using it, Elizabeth can unilaterally change the
confrontation into a point of agreement. Instead of arguing with Rafael
about his perceptions, she grants him his perceptions—after all, they’re
his. Instead of arguing about her intentions, she keeps the
responsibility for aligning her words with her intentions. And she goes
back into the conversation right where they left off. (For a fuller
discussion of the disconnect between what we mean and what we say, see

<p>THE GAP BETWEEN COMMUNICATION AND INTENT</p>
<p>One of the most common occurrences in stressful conversations is that
we all start relying far too much on our intentions. As the mercury in
the emotional thermometer rises, we presume that other people
automatically understand what we mean. We assume, for instance, that
people know we mean well. Indeed, research shows that in stressful
conversations, most speakers assume that the listener believes that they
have good intentions, regardless of what they say. Intentions can never
be that powerful in communications—and certainly not in stressful
conversations.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, just think of the last time someone told you not
to take something the wrong way. This may well have been uttered quite
sincerely by the speaker; nevertheless, most people automatically react
by stiffening inwardly, anticipating something at least mildly offensive
or antagonistic. And that is exactly the reaction that phrase is always
going to get. Because the simplest rule about stressful conversations is
that people don’t register intention despite words; we register
intention through words. In stressful conversations in particular, the
emphasis is on what is actually said, not on what we intend or feel.
This doesn’t mean that participants in stressful conversations don’t
have feelings or intentions that are valid and valuable. They do. But
when we talk about people in stressful communication, we’re talking
about communication between people—and not about intentions.</p>
<p>Of course, in difficult conversations we may all wish that we didn’t
have to be so explicit. We may want the other person to realize what we
mean even if we don’t spell it out. But that leads to the wrong division
of labor: with the listener interpreting rather than the speaker
communicating. In all conversations, but especially in stressful ones,
we are all responsible for getting across to one another precisely what
we want to say. In the end, it’s far more dignified for an executive to
come right out and tell an employee, “Corey, I’ve arranged for you to
speak with HR, because you won’t be with us after the end of July.”
Forcing someone to guess your intentions only prolongs the agony of the
inevitable.</p>
<p>This technique will work for Elizabeth regardless of Rafael’s motive.
If Rafael innocently misunderstood what she was saying, she isn’t
fighting him. She accepts his take on what she said and did and corrects
it. If his motive is hostile, Elizabeth doesn’t concur just to appease
him. She accepts and retries. No one loses face. No one scores points
off the other. No one gets drawn off on a tangent.</p>
<p>Fight tactics, not people</p>
<p>Rafael may have baffled Elizabeth, but Karen was acting with outright
malice toward Nick when she flew off the handle after a disastrous
meeting with the client. Nick certainly can’t prevent her from using the
thwarting tactics with which she has been so successful in the past. But
he can separate Karen’s character from her behavior. For instance, it’s
much more useful for him to think of Karen’s reactions as thwarting
tactics rather than as personal characteristics. If he thinks of Karen
as a distorting, hostile, threatening person, where does that lead? What
can anyone ever do about another person’s character? But if Nick sees
Karen’s behavior as a series of tactics that she is using with him
because they have worked for her in the past, he can think about using
countering techniques to neutralize them.</p>
<p>The best way to neutralize a tactic is to name it. It’s much harder
to use a tactic once it is openly identified. If Nick, for instance, had
said, “Karen, we’ve worked together pretty well for a long time. I don’t
know how to talk about what went wrong in the meeting when your take on
what happened, and what’s going on now, is so different from mine,” he
would have changed the game completely. He neither would have attacked
Karen nor remained the pawn of her tactics. But he would have made
Karen’s tactics in the conversation the dominant problem.</p>
<p>Openly identifying a tactic, particularly an aggressive one, is
disarming for another reason. Often we think of an aggressive
counterpart as persistently, even endlessly, contentious, but that isn’t
true. People have definite levels of aggression that they’re comfortable
with—and they are reluctant to raise the bar. When Nick doesn’t
acknowledge Karen’s tactics, she can use them unwittingly, or allegedly
so. But if Nick speaks of them, it would require more aggression on
Karen’s part to continue using the same tactics. If she is at or near
her aggression threshold, she won’t continue because that would make her
uncomfortable. Nick may not be able to stop Karen, but she may stop
herself.</p>
<p>People think stressful conversations are inevitable. And they are.
But that doesn’t mean they have to have bad resolutions. Consider a
client of mine, Jacqueline, the only woman on the board of an
engineering company. Another board member repeatedly ribbed her about
being a feminist and, on this occasion, he was telling a sexist
joke.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time that something like this had happened, and
Jacqueline felt the usual internal cacophony of reactions. But because
she was aware that this was a stressful situation for her, Jacqueline
was prepared. First, she let the joke hang in the air for a minute and
then went back to the issue they had been discussing. When Richard
didn’t let it go but escalated with a new poke—“Come on, Jackie, it was
a joke”—Jacqueline stood her ground. “Richard,” she said, “this kind of
humor is frivolous to you, but it is wrong, and moreover, it makes me,
the only woman on this board, feel pushed aside.” Jacqueline didn’t need
to say more. If Richard had continued to escalate, he would have lost
face. In fact, he backed down: “Well, I wouldn’t want my wife to hear
about my bad behavior a second time,” he snickered. Jacqueline was
silent. She had made her point; there was no need to take it
further.</p>
<p>Stressful conversations are never easy, but we can all fare better
if, like Jacqueline, we prepare for them by developing greater awareness
of our vulnerabilities and better techniques for handling ourselves. The
advice and tools described in this article can be helpful in
unilaterally reducing the strain in stressful conversations. All you
have to do is try them. If one technique doesn’t work, try another. Find
phrasing that feels natural. But keep practicing—you’ll find what works
best for you.</p>
