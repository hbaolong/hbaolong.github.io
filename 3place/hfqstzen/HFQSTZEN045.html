<h4 id="a-process-for-empathetic-product-design">7 A Process for
Empathetic Product Design</h4>
<p>By Jon Kolko</p>
<p>The discipline of product management is shifting from an external
focus on the market, or an internal focus on technology, to an
empathetic focus on people. While it’s not too difficult to rally people
around this general idea, it can be hard at first to understand how to
translate it into tactics. So in this article, I’ll walk through how we
applied this approach to a particular product at a startup and how it
led to large-scale adoption and, ultimately, the acquisition of the
company.</p>
<p>I was previously VP of design at MyEdu, where we focused on helping
students succeed in college, show their academic accomplishments, and
gain employment. MyEdu started with a series of free academic planning
tools, including a schedule planner. As we formalized a business model
focused on college recruiting, we conducted behavioral, empathetic
research with college students and recruiters. This type of qualitative
research focuses on what people do, rather than what they say. We spent
hours with students in their dorm rooms, watching them do their
homework, watch TV, and register for classes. We watched them being
college students, and our goal was not to identify workflow conflicts or
utilitarian problems to solve; it was to build a set of intuitive
feelings about what it means to be a college student. We conducted the
same form of research with recruiters, watching them speak to candidates
and work through their hiring process.</p>
<p>This form of research is misleadingly simple—you go and watch people.
The challenge is in forging a disarming relationship with people in a
very short period of time. Our goal is to form a master and apprentice
relationship: We enter these research activities as a humble apprentice,
expecting to learn from a master. It may sound a little funny, but
college students are masters of being in academia, with all of the
successes and failures this experience brings them.</p>
<p>As we complete our research, we transcribe the session in full. This
time-consuming effort is critical, because it embeds the participants’
collective voice in our heads. As we play, type, pause, and rewind our
recordings, we begin to quite literally think from the perspective of
the participant. I’ve found that I can repeat participant quotes and
“channel” their voices years after a research session is over. We
distribute the transcriptions into thousands of individual utterances,
and then we post the utterances all over our war room.</p>
<p>The input of our behavioral research is a profile of the type of
people we want to empathize with. The output of our research is a
massive data set of verbatim utterances, exploded into individual,
moveable parts.</p>
<p>Once we’ve generated a large quantity of data, our next step is to
synthesize the contents into meaningful insights. This is an arduous,
seemingly endless process—it will quite literally fill any amount of
time you allot to it. We read individual notes, highlight salient
points, and move the notes around. We build groups of notes in a
bottom-up fashion, identifying similarities and anomalies. We invite the
entire product team to participate: If they have 15 or 30 minutes, they
are encouraged to pop in, read some notes, and shift them to places that
make sense. Over time, the room begins to take shape. As groupings
emerge, we give them action-oriented names. Rather than using pithy
category labels like “Career Service” or “Employment,” we write initial
summary statements like “Students write résumés in order to find
jobs.”</p>
<p>When we’ve made substantial progress, we begin to provoke
introspection on the categories by asking “why”-oriented questions. And
the key to the whole process is that we answer these questions even
though we don’t know the answer for sure. We combine what we know about
students with what we know about ourselves. We build on our own life
experiences, and as we leverage our student-focused empathetic lens, we
make inferential leaps. In this way, we drive innovation and
simultaneously introduce risk. In this case, we asked the question, “Why
do students develop résumés to find jobs?” and answered it, “Because
they think employers want to see a résumé.” This is what Roger Martin
refers to as “abductive reasoning”: a form of logical recombination to
move past the expected and into the provocative world of
innovation.1</p>
<p>Finally, when we’ve answered these “why” questions about each group,
we create a series of insight statements, which are provocative
statements of truth about human behavior. We’ll build upon the why
statement, abstracting our answer away from the students we spent time
with and making a generalization about all students. We asked, “Why do
students develop résumés to find jobs?” and we answered it, “Because
they think employers want to see a résumé.” Now we’ll craft an insight
statement: “Students think they have an idea of what employers want in a
candidate, but they are often wrong.” We’ve shifted from a passive
statement to an active assertion. We’ve made a large inferential leap.
And we’ve arrived at the scaffold for a new product, service, or
idea.</p>
<p>We can create a similar provocative statement of truth about
recruiters by learning from employers. Based on our research, we
identified that recruiters spend very little time with each résumé but
have very strong opinions about candidates. Our insight statement
becomes “Recruiters make snap judgments, directly impacting a
candidate’s chances of success.” (See table 1.)</p>
<p>TABLE 1</p>
<p>The input of our synthesis process is the raw data from research,
transcribed and distributed on a large wall. The output of our synthesis
process is a series of insights: provocative statements of truth about
human behavior.</p>
<p>Now we can start to merge and compare insights in order to arrive at
a value proposition. As we connect the two insights from students and
employers and juxtapose them, we can narrow in on a “what-if”
opportunity. What if we taught students new ways to think about finding
a job? What if we showed students alternative paths to jobs? What if we
helped students identify their skills and present them to employers in a
credible way? (See table 2.)</p>
<p>TABLE 2</p>
<p>If we subtly shift the language, we arrive at a capability value
proposition: “MyEdu helps students identify their skills and present
them to employers in a credible way.”</p>
<p>This value proposition is a promise. We promise to students that if
they use our products, we’ll help them identify their skills and show
those skills to employers. If we fail to deliver on that promise,
students have a poor experience with our products—and leave. The same is
true for any product or service company. If Comcast promises to deliver
internet access to our home but doesn’t, we get frustrated. If they fail
frequently enough, we dump them for a company with a similar or better
value proposition.</p>
<p>Insights act as the input to this phase in the empathetic design
process, and the output of this process is an emotionally charged value
promise.</p>
<p>Armed with a value proposition, we have constraints around what we’re
building. In addition to providing an external statement of value, this
statement also indicates how we can determine if the capabilities,
features, and other details we brainstorm are appropriate to include in
the offering. If we dream up a new feature and it doesn’t help students
identify their skills and present them to employers in a credible way,
it’s not appropriate for us to build. The value promise becomes the
objective criteria in a subjective context, acting as a sieve through
which we can pour our good ideas.</p>
<p>Now we tell stories—what we call “hero flows,” or the main paths
through our products that help people become happy or content. These
stories paint a picture of how a person uses our product to receive the
value promise. We write these, draw them as stick figures, and start to
sketch the real product interfaces. And then, through a fairly standard
product development process, we bring these stories to life with
wireframes, visual comps, motion studies, and other traditional digital
product assets.</p>
<p>Through this process, we developed the MyEdu Profile: a highly visual
record that helps students highlight academic accomplishments and
present them to employers in the context of recruiting.</p>
<p>During research, we heard from some college students that “LinkedIn
makes me feel dumb.” They don’t have a lot of professional experiences,
so asking them to highlight these accomplishments is a nonstarter. But
as students use our academic planning tools, their behavior and
activities translate to profile elements that highlight their academic
accomplishments: We can deliver on our value proposition.</p>
<p>Our value proposition acts as the input to the core of product
development. The output of this process is our products, which
facilitate the iterative, incremental set of capabilities that shift
behavior and help people achieve their wants, needs, and desires.</p>
<p>The LinkedIn example we highlighted illustrates what we call
“empathetic research.” We marinated in data and persevered through a
rigorous process of sense making in order to arrive at insights. We
leveraged these insights to provoke a value proposition, and then we
built stories on top of the entire scaffold. And as a result of this
process, we created a product with emotional resonance. The profile
product attracted more than a million college students in about a year,
and during a busy academic registration period, we saw growth of between
3,000 to 3,500 new student profiles a day. After we were acquired by
education software company Blackboard and integrated this into the
flagship learning management system, we saw growth of between 18,000 and
20,000 new student profiles a day.</p>
<p>The process described here is not hard, and it’s not new—companies
like Frog Design have been leveraging this approach for years, and I
learned the fundamentals of empathetic design when I was an
undergraduate at Carnegie Mellon. But for most companies, this process
requires leaning on a different corporate ideology. It’s a process
informed by deep qualitative data rather than statistical market data.
It celebrates people rather than technology. And it requires identifying
and believing in behavioral insights, which are subjective and, in their
ambiguity, full of risk.</p>
