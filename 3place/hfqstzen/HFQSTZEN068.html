<h4 id="from-purpose-to-impact">6 From Purpose to Impact</h4>
<p>By Nick Craig and Scott A. Snook</p>
<p>The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and
the day you find out why.</p>
<p>—Mark Twain</p>
<p>Over the past five years, there’s been an explosion of interest in
purpose-driven leadership. Academics argue persuasively that an
executive’s most important role is to be a steward of the organization’s
purpose. Business experts make the case that purpose is a key to
exceptional performance, while psychologists describe it as the pathway
to greater well-being.</p>
<p>Doctors have even found that people with purpose in their lives are
less prone to disease. Purpose is increasingly being touted as the key
to navigating the complex, volatile, ambiguous world we face today,
where strategy is ever changing and few decisions are obviously right or
wrong.</p>
<p>Despite this growing understanding, however, a big challenge remains.
In our work training thousands of managers at organizations from GE to
the Girl Scouts, and teaching an equal number of executives and students
at Harvard Business School, we’ve found that fewer than 20% of leaders
have a strong sense of their own individual purpose. Even fewer can
distill their purpose into a concrete statement. They may be able to
clearly articulate their organization’s mission: Think of Google’s “To
organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and
useful,” or Charles Schwab’s “A relentless ally for the individual
investor.” But when asked to describe their own purpose, they typically
fall back on something generic and nebulous: “Help others excel.”
“Ensure success.” “Empower my people.” Just as problematic, hardly any
of them have a clear plan for translating purpose into action. As a
result, they limit their aspirations and often fail to achieve their
most ambitious professional and personal goals.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to change that—to help executives find and define
their leadership purpose and put it to use. Building on the seminal work
of our colleague Bill George, our programs initially covered a wide
range of topics related to authentic leadership, but in recent years
purpose has emerged as the cornerstone of our teaching and coaching.
Executives tell us it is the key to accelerating their growth and
deepening their impact, in both their professional and personal lives.
Indeed, we believe that the process of articulating your purpose and
finding the courage to live it—what we call purpose to impact—is the
single most important developmental task you can undertake as a
leader.</p>
<p>Consider Dolf van den Brink, the president and CEO of Heineken USA.
Working with us, he identified a decidedly unique purpose statement—“To
be the wuxia master who saves the kingdom”—which reflects his love of
Chinese kung fu movies, the inspiration he takes from the wise, skillful
warriors in them, and the realization that he, too, revels in high-risk
situations that compel him to take action. With that impetus, he was
able to create a plan for reviving a challenged legacy business during
extremely difficult economic conditions. We’ve also watched a retail
operations chief call on his newly clarified purpose—“Compelled to make
things better, whomever, wherever, however”—to make the “hard,
cage-rattling changes” needed to beat back a global competitor. And
we’ve seen a factory director in Egypt use his purpose—“Create families
that excel”—to persuade employees that they should honor the 2012
protest movement not by joining the marches but by maintaining their
loyalties to one another and keeping their shared operation running.</p>
<p>We’ve seen similar results outside the corporate world. Kathi Snook
(Scott’s wife) is a retired army colonel who’d been struggling to
reengage in work after several years as a stay-at-home mom. But after
nailing her purpose statement—“To be the gentle, behind-the-scenes,
kick-in-the-ass reason for success,” something she’d done throughout her
military career and with her kids—she decided to run for a hotly
contested school committee seat, and won.</p>
<p>And we’ve implemented this thinking across organizations. Unilever is
a company that is committed to purpose-driven leadership, and Jonathan
Donner, the head of global learning there, has been a key partner in
refining our approach. Working with his company and several other
organizations, we’ve helped more than 1,000 leaders through the
purpose-to-impact process and have begun to track and review their
progress over the past two to three years. Many have seen dramatic
results, ranging from two-step promotions to sustained improvement in
business results. Most important, the vast majority tell us they’ve
developed a new ability to thrive in even the most challenging
times.</p>
<p>In this article, we share our step-by-step framework to start you
down the same path. We’ll explain how to identify your purpose and then
develop an impact plan to achieve concrete results.</p>
<p>What is purpose?</p>
<p>Most of us go to our graves with our music still inside us,
unplayed.</p>
<p>—Oliver Wendell Holmes</p>
<p>Your leadership purpose is who you are and what makes you
distinctive. Whether you’re an entrepreneur at a startup or the CEO of a
Fortune 500 company, a call center rep or a software developer, your
purpose is your brand, what you’re driven to achieve, the magic that
makes you tick. It’s not what you do, it’s how you do your job and
why—the strengths and passions you bring to the table no matter where
you’re seated. Although you may express your purpose in different ways
in different contexts, it’s what everyone close to you recognizes as
uniquely you and would miss most if you were gone.</p>
<p>When Kathi Snook shared her purpose statement with her family and
friends, the response was instantaneous and overwhelming: “Yes! That’s
you—all business, all the time!” In every role and every context—as
captain of the army gymnastics team, as a math teacher at West Point,
informally with her family and friends—she had always led from behind, a
gentle but forceful catalyst for others’ success. Through this new lens,
she was able to see herself—and her future—more clearly. When Dolf van
den Brink revealed his newly articulated purpose to his wife, she easily
recognized the “wuxia master” who had led his employees through the
turmoil of serious fighting and unrest in the Congo and was now ready to
attack the challenges at Heineken USA head-on.</p>
<p>At its core, your leadership purpose springs from your identity, the
essence of who you are. Purpose is not a list of the education,
experience, and skills you’ve gathered in your life. We’ll use ourselves
as examples. The fact that Scott is a retired army colonel with an MBA
and a PhD is not his purpose. His purpose is “to help others live more
‘meaning-full’ lives.” Purpose is also not a professional title, limited
to your current job or organization. Nick’s purpose is not “To lead the
Authentic Leadership Institute.” That’s his job. His purpose is “To wake
you up and have you find that you are home.” He has been doing just that
since he was a teenager, and if you sit next to him on the shuttle from
Boston to New York, he’ll wake you up (figuratively), too. He simply
can’t help himself.</p>
<p>Purpose is definitely not some jargon-filled catchall (“Empower my
team to achieve exceptional business results while delighting our
customers”). It should be specific and personal, resonating with you and
you alone. It doesn’t have to be aspirational or cause based (“Save the
whales” or “Feed the hungry”). And it’s not what you think it should
be—it’s who you can’t help being. In fact, it might not necessarily be
all that flattering (“Be the thorn in people’s side that keeps them
moving!”).</p>
<p>How do you find it?</p>
<p>To be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best, night
and day, to make you everybody else, means to fight the hardest battle
which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting.</p>
<p>—E.E. Cummings</p>
<p>Finding your leadership purpose is not easy. If it were, we’d all
know exactly why we’re here and be living that purpose every minute of
every day. As E.E. Cummings suggests, we are constantly bombarded by
powerful messages (from parents, bosses, management gurus, advertisers,
celebrities) about what we should be (smarter, stronger, richer) and
about how to lead (empower others, lead from behind, be authentic,
distribute power). To figure out who you are in such a world, let alone
“be nobody but yourself,” is indeed hard work. However, our experience
shows that when you have a clear sense of who you are, everything else
follows naturally.</p>
<p>Some people will come to the purpose-to-impact journey with a natural
bent toward introspection and reflection. Others will find the
experience uncomfortable and anxiety provoking. A few will just roll
their eyes. We’ve worked with leaders of all stripes and can attest that
even the most skeptical discover personal and professional value in the
experience. At one multinational corporation, we worked with a senior
lawyer who characterized himself as “the least likely person to ever
find this stuff useful.” Yet he became such a supporter that he required
all his people to do the program. “I have never read a self-help book,
and I don’t plan to,” he told his staff. “But if you want to become an
exceptional leader, you have to know your leadership purpose.” The key
to engaging both the dreamers and the skeptics is to build a process
that has room to express individuality but also offers step-by-step
practical guidance.</p>
<p>The first task is to mine your life story for common threads and
major themes. The point is to identify your core, lifelong strengths,
values, and passions—those pursuits that energize you and bring you joy.
We use a variety of prompts but have found three to be most
effective:</p>
<p>What did you especially love doing when you were a child, before the
world told you what you should or shouldn’t like or do? Describe a
moment and how it made you feel.</p>
<p>Tell us about two of your most challenging life experiences. How have
they shaped you?</p>
<p>What do you enjoy doing in your life now that helps you sing your
song?</p>
<p>We strongly recommend grappling with these questions in a small group
of a few peers, because we’ve found that it’s almost impossible for
people to identify their leadership purpose by themselves. You can’t get
a clear picture of yourself without trusted colleagues or friends to act
as mirrors.</p>
<p>After this reflective work, take a shot at crafting a clear, concise,
and declarative statement of purpose: “My leadership purpose is
______________.” The words in your purpose statement must be yours. They
must capture your essence. And they must call you to action.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how the process works, consider the
experiences of a few executives. When we asked one manager about her
childhood passions, she told us about growing up in rural Scotland and
delighting in “discovery” missions. One day, she and a friend set out
determined to find frogs and spent the whole day going from pond to
pond, turning over every stone. Just before dark, she discovered a
single frog and was triumphant. The purpose statement she later
crafted—“Always find the frogs!”—is perfect for her current role as the
senior VP of RandandandandD for her company.</p>
<p>Another executive used two “crucible” life experiences to craft her
purpose. The first was personal: Years before, as a divorced young
mother of two, she found herself homeless and begging on the street, but
she used her wits to get back on her feet. The second was professional:
During the economic crisis of 2008, she had to oversee her company’s
retrenchment from Asia and was tasked with closing the flagship
operation in the region. Despite the near hopeless job environment, she
was able to help every one of her employees find another job before
letting them go. After discussing these stories with her group, she
shifted her purpose statement from “Continually and consistently develop
and facilitate the growth and development of myself and others leading
to great performance” to “With tenacity, create brilliance.”</p>
<p>Dolf came to his “wuxia master” statement after exploring not only
his film preferences but also his extraordinary crucible experience in
the Congo, when militants were threatening the brewery he managed and he
had to order it barricaded to protect his employees and prevent looting.
The Egyptian factory director focused on family as his purpose because
his stories revealed that familial love and support had been the key to
facing every challenge in his life, while the retail operations chief
used “Compelled to improve” after realizing that his greatest
achievements had always come when he pushed himself and others out of
their comfort zones.</p>
<p>As you review your stories, you will see a unifying thread, just as
these executives did. Pull it, and you’ll uncover your purpose. (The
exhibit “Purpose Statements” offers a sampling of purpose
statements.)</p>
<p>Purpose statements</p>
<p>FROM BAD . . . TO GOOD . . .</p>
<p>Lead new markets department to achieve exceptional business results
Eliminate chaos</p>
<p>Be a driver in the infrastructure business that allows each person to
achieve their needed outcomes while also mastering the new drivers of
our business as I balance my family and work demands Bring water and
power to the two billion people who do not have it</p>
<p>Continually and consistently develop and facilitate the growth and
development of myself and others, leading to great performance With
tenacity, create brilliance</p>
<p>How do you put your purpose into action?</p>
<p>This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized
by yourself as a mighty one.</p>
<p>—George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p>Clarifying your purpose as a leader is critical, but writing the
statement is not enough. You must also envision the impact you’ll have
on your world as a result of living your purpose. Your actions—not your
words—are what really matter. Of course, it’s virtually impossible for
any of us to fully live into our purpose 100% of the time. But with work
and careful planning, we can do it more often, more consciously,
wholeheartedly, and effectively.</p>
<p>Purpose-to-impact plans differ from traditional development plans in
several important ways: They start with a statement of leadership
purpose rather than of a business or career goal. They take a holistic
view of professional and personal life rather than ignore the fact that
you have a family or outside interests and commitments. They incorporate
meaningful, purpose-infused language to create a document that speaks to
you, not just to any person in your job or role. They force you to
envision long-term opportunities for living your purpose (three to five
years out) and then help you to work backward from there (two years out,
one year, six months, three months, 30 days) to set specific goals for
achieving them.</p>
<p>When executives approach development in this purpose-driven way,
their aspirations—for instance, Kathi’s decision to get involved in the
school board, or the Egyptian factory director’s ambition to run
manufacturing and logistics across the Middle East—are stoked. Leaders
also become more energized in their current roles. Dolf’s impact plan
inspired him to tackle his role at Heineken USA with four mottos for his
team: “Be brave,” “Decide and do,” “Hunt as a pack,” and “Take it
personally.” When Unilever executive Jostein Solheim created a
development plan around his purpose—“To be part of a global movement
that makes changing the world seem fun and achievable”—he realized he
wanted to stay on as CEO of the Ben andandandand Jerry’s business rather
than moving up the corporate ladder.</p>
<p>Purpose-to-impact planning versus traditional development
planning</p>
<p>PURPOSE-TO-IMPACT PLANNING TRADITIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLANNING</p>
<p>Uses meaningful, purpose-infused language Uses standard business
language</p>
<p>Is focused on strengths to realize career aspirations Is focused on
weaknesses to address performance</p>
<p>Elicits a statement of leadership purpose that explains how you will
lead States a business- or career-driven goal</p>
<p>Sets incremental goals related to living your leadership purpose
Measures success using metrics tied to the firm’s mission and goals</p>
<p>Focuses on the future, working backward Focuses on the present,
working forward</p>
<p>Is unique to you; addresses who you are as a leader Is generic;
addresses the job or role</p>
<p>Takes a holistic view of work and family Ignores goals and
responsibilities outside the office</p>
<p>Let’s now look at a hypothetical purpose-to-impact plan (representing
a composite of several people with whom we’ve worked) for an in-depth
view of the process. “Richard” arrived at his purpose only after being
prodded into talking about his lifelong passion for sailing; suddenly,
he’d found a set of experiences and language that could redefine how he
saw his job in procurement.</p>
<p>Richard’s development plan leads with the purpose statement he
crafted: “To harness all the elements to win the race.” This is followed
by an explanation of why that’s his purpose: Research shows that
understanding what motivates us dramatically increases our ability to
achieve big goals.</p>
<p>Next, Richard addresses his three- to five-year goals using the
language of his purpose statement. We find that this is a good time
frame to target first; several years is long enough that even the most
disillusioned managers could imagine they’d actually be living into
their purpose by then. But it’s not so distant that it creates
complacency. A goal might be to land a top job—in Richard’s case, a
global procurement role—but the focus should be on how you will do it,
what kind of leader you’ll be.</p>
<p>Then he considers two-year goals. This is a time frame in which the
grand future and current reality begin to merge. What new
responsibilities will you take on? What do you have to do to set
yourself up for the longer term? Remember to address your personal life,
too, because you should be more fully living into your purpose
everywhere. Richard’s goals explicitly reference his family, or “shore
team.”</p>
<p>A PURPOSE-TO-IMPACT PLAN</p>
<p>This sample plan shows how “Richard” uses his unique leadership
purpose to envision big-picture aspirations and then work backward to
set more-specific goals.</p>

Many people ask, “What if most of what I am doing today isn’t aligned in
any way with my leadership purpose? How do I get from here to there?”
We’ve found two ways to address this problem. First, think about whether
you can rewrite the narrative on parts of your work, or change the way
you do some tasks, so that they become an expression of your purpose.
For example, the phrase “seaworthy boat” helps Richard see the meaning
in managing a basic procurement process. Second, consider whether you
can add an activity that is 100% aligned with your purpose. We’ve found
that most people can manage to devote 5% to 10% of their time to
something that energizes them and helps others see their strengths. Take
Richard’s decision to contribute to the global strategic procurement
effort: It’s not part of his “day job,” but it gets him involved in a
more purpose-driven project.</p>
<p>Now we get to the nitty-gritty. What are the critical next steps that
you must take in the coming six months, three months, and 30 days to
accomplish the one-year goals you’ve set out? The importance of small
wins is well documented in almost every management discipline from
change initiatives to innovation. In detailing your next steps, don’t
write down all the requirements of your job. List the activities or
results that are most critical given your newly clarified leadership
purpose and ambitions. You’ll probably notice that a number of your
tasks seem much less urgent than they did before, while others you had
pushed to the side take priority.</p>
<p>Finally, we look at the key relationships needed to turn your plan
into reality. Identify two or three people who can help you live more
fully into your leadership purpose. For Richard, it is Sarah, the HR
manager who will help him assemble his crew, and his wife, Jill, the
manager of his “shore team.”</p>
<p>Executives tell us that their individual purpose-to-impact plans help
them stay true to their short- and long-term goals, inspiring courage,
commitment, and focus. When they’re frustrated or flagging, they pull
out the plans to remind themselves what they want to accomplish and how
they’ll succeed. After creating his plan, the retail operations chief
facing global competition said he’s no longer “shying away from things
that are too hard.” Dolf van den Brink said: “I’m much clearer on where
I really can contribute and where not. I have full clarity on the kind
of roles I aspire to and can make explicit choices along the way.” What
creates the greatest leaders and companies? Each of them operates from a
slightly different set of assumptions about the world, their industry,
what can or can’t be done. That individual perspective allows them to
create great value and have significant impact. They all operate with a
unique leadership purpose. To be a truly effective leader, you must do
the same. Clarify your purpose, and put it to work.</p>
