<h4 id="discovering-your-authentic-leadership">1 Discovering Your
Authentic Leadership</h4>
<p>By Bill George, Peter Sims, Andrew N. McLean, and Diana Mayer</p>
<p>During the past 50 years, leadership scholars have conducted more
than 1,000 studies in an attempt to determine the definitive styles,
characteristics, or personality traits of great leaders. None of these
studies has produced a clear profile of the ideal leader. Thank
goodness. If scholars had produced a cookie-cutter leadership style,
individuals would be forever trying to imitate it. They would make
themselves into personae, not people, and others would see through them
immediately.</p>
<p>No one can be authentic by trying to imitate someone else. You can
learn from others’ experiences, but there is no way you can be
successful when you are trying to be like them. People trust you when
you are genuine and authentic, not a replica of someone else. Amgen CEO
and president Kevin Sharer, who gained priceless experience working as
Jack Welch’s assistant in the 1980s, saw the downside of GE’s cult of
personality in those days. “Everyone wanted to be like Jack,” he
explains. “Leadership has many voices. You need to be who you are, not
try to emulate somebody else.”</p>
<p>Over the past five years, people have developed a deep distrust of
leaders. It is increasingly evident that we need a new kind of business
leader in the 21st century. In 2003, Bill George’s book, Authentic
Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value,
challenged a new generation to lead authentically. Authentic leaders
demonstrate a passion for their purpose, practice their values
consistently, and lead with their hearts as well as their heads. They
establish long-term, meaningful relationships and have the
self-discipline to get results. They know who they are.</p>
<p>Many readers of Authentic Leadership, including several CEOs,
indicated that they had a tremendous desire to become authentic leaders
and wanted to know how. As a result, our research team set out to answer
the question, “How can people become and remain authentic leaders?” We
interviewed 125 leaders to learn how they developed their leadership
abilities. These interviews constitute the largest in-depth study of
leadership development ever under taken. Our interviewees discussed
openly and honestly how they realized their potential and candidly
shared their life stories, personal struggles, failures, and
triumphs.</p>
<p>The people we talked with ranged in age from 23 to 93, with no fewer
than 15 per decade. They were chosen based on their reputations for
authenticity and effectiveness as leaders, as well as our personal
knowledge of them. We also solicited recommendations from other leaders
and academics. The resulting group includes women and men from a diverse
array of racial, religious, and socioeconomic backgrounds and
nationalities. Half of them are CEOs, and the other half comprises a
range of profit and nonprofit leaders, midcareer leaders, and young
leaders just starting on their journeys.</p>
<p>After interviewing these individuals, we believe we understand why
more than 1,000 studies have not produced a profile of an ideal leader.
Analyzing 3,000 pages of transcripts, our team was startled to see that
these people did not identify any universal characteristics, traits,
skills, or styles that led to their success. Rather, their leadership
emerged from their life stories. Consciously and subconsciously, they
were constantly testing themselves through real-world experiences and
reframing their life stories to understand who they were at their core.
In doing so, they discovered the purpose of their leadership and learned
that being authentic made them more effective.</p>
<p>These findings are extremely encouraging: You do not have to be born
with specific characteristics or traits of a leader. You do not have to
wait for a tap on the shoulder. You do not have to be at the top of your
organization. Instead, you can discover your potential right now. As one
of our interviewees, Young andandandand Rubicam chairman and CEO Ann
Fudge, said, “All of us have the spark of leadership in us, whether it
is in business, in government, or as a nonprofit volunteer. The
challenge is to understand ourselves well enough to discover where we
can use our leadership gifts to serve others.”</p>
<p>Discovering your authentic leadership requires a commitment to
developing yourself. Like musicians and athletes, you must devote
yourself to a lifetime of realizing your potential. Most people Kroger
CEO David Dillon has seen become good leaders were self-taught. Dillon
said, “The advice I give to individuals in our company is not to expect
the company to hand you a development plan. You need to take
responsibility for developing yourself.”</p>
<p>In the following pages, we draw upon lessons from our interviews to
describe how people become authentic leaders. First and most important,
they frame their life stories in ways that allow them to see themselves
not as passive observers of their lives but rather as individuals who
can develop self-awareness from their experiences. Authentic leaders act
on that awareness by practicing their values and principles, sometimes
at substantial risk to themselves. They are careful to balance their
motivations so that they are driven by these inner values as much as by
a desire for external rewards or recognition. Authentic leaders also
keep a strong support team around them, ensuring that they live
integrated, grounded lives.</p>
<p>Learning from your life story</p>
<p>The journey to authentic leadership begins with understanding the
story of your life. Your life story provides the context for your
experiences, and through it, you can find the inspiration to make an
impact in the world. As the novelist John Barth once wrote, “The story
of your life is not your life. It is your story.” In other words, it is
your personal narrative that matters, not the mere facts of your life.
Your life narrative is like a permanent recording playing in your head.
Over and over, you replay the events and personal interactions that are
important to your life, attempting to make sense of them to find your
place in the world.</p>
<p>While the life stories of authentic leaders cover the full spectrum
of experiences—including the positive impact of parents, athletic
coaches, teachers, and mentors—many leaders reported that their
motivation came from a difficult experience in their lives. They
described the transformative effects of the loss of a job; personal
illness; the untimely death of a close friend or relative; and feelings
of being excluded, discriminated against, and rejected by peers. Rather
than seeing themselves as victims, though, authentic leaders used these
formative experiences to give meaning to their lives. They reframed
these events to rise above their challenges and to discover their
passion to lead.</p>
<p>Let’s focus now on one leader in particular, Novartis chairman and
CEO Daniel Vasella, whose life story was one of the most difficult of
all the people we interviewed. He emerged from extreme challenges in his
youth to reach the pinnacle of the global pharmaceutical industry, a
trajectory that illustrates the trials many leaders have to go through
on their journeys to authentic leadership.</p>
<p>Vasella was born in 1953 to a modest family in Fribourg, Switzerland.
His early years were filled with medical problems that stoked his
passion to become a physician. His first recollections were of a
hospital where he was admitted at age four when he suffered from food
poisoning. Falling ill with asthma at age five, he was sent alone to the
mountains of eastern Switzerland for two summers. He found the
four-month separations from his parents especially difficult because his
caretaker had an alcohol problem and was unresponsive to his needs.</p>
<p>At age eight, Vasella had tuberculosis, followed by meningitis, and
was sent to a sanatorium for a year. Lonely and homesick, he suffered a
great deal that year, as his parents rarely visited him. He still
remembers the pain and fear when the nurses held him down during the
lumbar punctures so that he would not move. One day, a new physician
arrived and took time to explain each step of the procedure. Vasella
asked the doctor if he could hold a nurse’s hand rather than being held
down. “The amazing thing is that this time the procedure didn’t hurt,”
Vasella recalls. “Afterward, the doctor asked me, ‘How was that?’ I
reached up and gave him a big hug. These human gestures of forgiveness,
caring, and compassion made a deep impression on me and on the kind of
person I wanted to become.”</p>
<p>Throughout his early years, Vasella’s life continued to be unsettled.
When he was 10, his 18-year-old sister passed away after suffering from
cancer for two years. Three years later, his father died in surgery. To
support the family, his mother went to work in a distant town and came
home only once every three weeks. Left to himself, he and his friends
held beer parties and got into frequent fights. This lasted for three
years until he met his first girlfriend, whose affection changed his
life.</p>
<p>At 20, Vasella entered medical school, later graduating with honors.
During medical school, he sought out psychotherapy so he could come to
terms with his early experiences and not feel like a victim. Through
analysis, he reframed his life story and realized that he wanted to help
a wider range of people than he could as an individual practitioner.
Upon completion of his residency, he applied to become chief physician
at the University of Zurich; however, the search committee considered
him too young for the position.</p>
<p>Disappointed but not surprised, Vasella decided to use his abilities
to increase his impact on medicine. At that time, he had a growing
fascination with finance and business. He talked with the head of the
pharmaceutical division of Sandoz, who offered him the opportunity to
join the company’s US affiliate. In his five years in the United States,
Vasella flourished in the stimulating environment, first as a sales
representative and later as a product manager, and advanced rapidly
through the Sandoz marketing organization.</p>
<p>When Sandoz merged with Ciba-Geigy in 1996, Vasella was named CEO of
the combined companies, now called Novartis, despite his young age and
limited experience. Once in the CEO’s role, Vasella blossomed as a
leader. He envisioned the opportunity to build a great global health
care company that could help people through lifesaving new drugs, such
as Gleevec, which has proved to be highly effective for patients with
chronic myeloid leukemia. Drawing on the physician role models of his
youth, he built an entirely new Novartis culture centered on compassion,
competence, and competition. These moves established Novartis as a giant
in the industry and Vasella as a compassionate leader.</p>
<p>Vasella’s experience is just one of dozens provided by authentic
leaders who traced their inspiration directly from their life stories.
Asked what empowered them to lead, these leaders consistently replied
that they found their strength through transformative experiences. Those
experiences enabled them to understand the deeper purpose of their
leadership.</p>
<p>Knowing your authentic self</p>
<p>When the 75 members of Stanford Graduate School of Business’s
Advisory Council were asked to recommend the most important capability
for leaders to develop, their answer was nearly unanimous:
self-awareness. Yet many leaders, especially those early in their
careers, are trying so hard to establish themselves in the world that
they leave little time for self-exploration. They strive to achieve
success in tangible ways that are recognized in the external
world—money, fame, power, status, or a rising stock price. Often their
drive enables them to be professionally successful for a while, but they
are unable to sustain that success. As they age, they may find something
is missing in their lives and realize they are holding back from being
the person they want to be. Knowing their authentic selves requires the
courage and honesty to open up and examine their experiences. As they do
so, leaders become more humane and willing to be vulnerable.</p>
<p>Of all the leaders we interviewed, David Pottruck, former CEO of
Charles Schwab, had one of the most persistent journeys to
self-awareness. An all-league football player in high school, Pottruck
became MVP of his college team at the University of Pennsylvania. After
completing his MBA at Wharton and a stint with Citigroup, he joined
Charles Schwab as head of marketing, moving from New York to San
Francisco. An extremely hard worker, Pottruck could not under stand why
his new colleagues resented the long hours he put in and his
aggressiveness in pushing for results. “I thought my accomplishments
would speak for themselves,” he said. “It never occurred to me that my
level of energy would intimidate and offend other people, because in my
mind I was trying to help the company.”</p>
<p>Pottruck was shocked when his boss told him, “Dave, your colleagues
do not trust you.” As he recalled, “That feedback was like a dagger to
my heart. I was in denial, as I didn’t see myself as others saw me. I
became a lightning rod for friction, but I had no idea how self-serving
I looked to other people. Still, somewhere in my inner core the feedback
resonated as true.” Pottruck realized that he could not succeed unless
he identified and overcame his blind spots.</p>
<p>Denial can be the greatest hurdle that leaders face in becoming
self-aware. They all have egos that need to be stroked, insecurities
that need to be smoothed, fears that need to be allayed. Authentic
leaders realize that they have to be willing to listen to
feedback—especially the kind they don’t want to hear. It was only after
his second divorce that Pottruck finally was able to acknowledge that he
still had large blind spots: “After my second marriage fell apart, I
thought I had a wife-selection problem.” Then he worked with a counselor
who delivered some hard truths: “The good news is you do not have a
wife-selection problem; the bad news is you have a husband-behavior
problem.” Pottruck then made a determined effort to change. As he
described it, “I was like a guy who has had three heart attacks and
finally realizes he has to quit smoking and lose some weight.”</p>
<p>These days Pottruck is happily remarried and listens carefully when
his wife offers constructive feedback. He acknowledges that he falls
back on his old habits at times, particularly in high-stress situations,
but now he has developed ways of coping with stress. “I have had enough
success in life to have that foundation of self-respect, so I can take
the criticism and not deny it. I have finally learned to tolerate my
failures and disappointments and not beat myself up.”</p>
<p>Practicing your values and principles</p>
<p>The values that form the basis for authentic leadership are derived
from your beliefs and convictions, but you will not know what your true
values are until they are tested under pressure. It is relatively easy
to list your values and to live by them when things are going well. When
your success, your career, or even your life hangs in the balance, you
learn what is most important, what you are prepared to sacrifice, and
what trade-offs you are willing to make.</p>
<p>Leadership principles are values translated into action. Having a
solid base of values and testing them under fire enables you to develop
the principles you will use in leading. For example, a value such as
“concern for others” might be translated into a leadership principle
such as “create a work environment where people are respected for their
contributions, provided job security, and allowed to fulfill their
potential.”</p>
<p>Consider Jon Huntsman, the founder and chairman of Huntsman
Corporation. His moral values were deeply challenged when he worked for
the Nixon administration in 1972, shortly before Watergate. After a
brief stint in the US Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
(HEW), he took a job under H. R. Haldeman, President Nixon’s powerful
chief of staff. Huntsman said he found the experience of taking orders
from Haldeman “very mixed. I wasn’t geared to take orders, irrespective
of whether they were ethically or morally right.” He explained, “We had
a few clashes, as plenty of things that Haldeman wanted to do were
questionable. An amoral atmosphere permeated the White House.”</p>
<p>One day, Haldeman directed Huntsman to help him entrap a California
congressman who had been opposing a White House initiative. The
congressman was part owner of a plant that reportedly employed
undocumented workers. To gather information to embarrass the
congressman, Haldeman told Huntsman to get the plant manager of a
company Huntsman owned to place some undocumented workers at the
congressman’s plant in an undercover operation.</p>
<p>“There are times when we react too quickly and fail to realize
immediately what is right and wrong,” Huntsman recalled. “This was one
of those times when I didn’t think it through. I knew instinctively it
was wrong, but it took a few minutes for the notion to percolate. After
15 minutes, my inner moral compass made itself noticed and enabled me to
recognize this wasn’t the right thing to do. Values that had accompanied
me since childhood kicked in. Halfway through my conversation with our
plant manager, I said to him, ‘Let’s not do this. I don’t want to play
this game. Forget that I called.’”</p>
<p>Huntsman told Haldeman that he would not use his employees in this
way. “Here I was saying no to the second most powerful person in the
country. He didn’t appreciate responses like that, as he viewed them as
signs of disloyalty. I might as well have been saying farewell. So be
it. I left within the next six months.”</p>
<p>YOUR DEVELOPMENT AS AN AUTHENTIC LEADER</p>
<p>As you read this article, think about the basis for your leadership
development and the path you need to follow to become an authentic
leader. Then ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p>Which people and experiences in your early life had the greatest
impact on you?</p>
<p>What tools do you use to become self-aware? What is your authentic
self? What are the moments when you say to yourself, “This is the real
me”?</p>
<p>What are your most deeply held values? Where did they come from? Have
your values changed significantly since your childhood? How do your
values inform your actions?</p>
<p>What motivates you extrinsically? What are your intrinsic
motivations? How do you balance extrinsic and intrinsic motivation in
your life?</p>
<p>What kind of support team do you have? How can your support team make
you a more authen tic leader? How should you diversify your team to
broaden your perspective?</p>
<p>Is your life integrated? Are you able to be the same person in all
aspects of your life—personal, work, family, and community? If not, what
is holding you back?</p>
<p>What does being authentic mean in your life? Are you more effective
as a leader when you behave authentically? Have you ever paid a price
for your authenticity as a leader? Was it worth it?</p>
<p>What steps can you take today, tomorrow, and over the next year to
develop your authentic leadership?</p>
<p>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic motivations</p>
<p>Because authentic leaders need to sustain high levels of motivation
and keep their lives in balance, it is critically important for them to
understand what drives them. There are two types of
motivations—extrinsic and intrinsic. Although they are reluctant to
admit it, many leaders are propelled to achieve by measuring their
success against the outside world’s parameters. They enjoy the
recognition and status that come with promotions and financial rewards.
Intrinsic motivations, on the other hand, are derived from their sense
of the meaning of their life. They are closely linked to one’s life
story and the way one frames it. Examples include personal growth,
helping other people develop, taking on social causes, and making a
difference in the world. The key is to find a balance between your
desires for external validation and the intrinsic motivations that
provide fulfillment in your work.</p>
<p>Many interviewees advised aspiring leaders to be wary of getting
caught up in social, peer, or parental expectations. Debra Dunn, who has
worked in Silicon Valley for decades as a Hewlett-Packard executive,
acknowledged the constant pressures from external sources: “The path of
accumulating material possessions is clearly laid out. You know how to
measure it. If you don’t pursue that path, people wonder what is wrong
with you. The only way to avoid getting caught up in materialism is to
understand where you find happiness and fulfillment.”</p>
<p>Moving away from the external validation of personal achievement is
not always easy. Achievement-oriented leaders grow so accustomed to
successive accomplishments throughout their early years that it takes
courage to pursue their intrinsic motivations. But at some point, most
leaders recognize that they need to address more difficult questions in
order to pursue truly meaningful success. McKinsey’s Alice Woodwark, who
at 29 has already achieved notable success, reflected: “My version of
achievement was pretty naive, born of things I learned early in life
about praise and being valued. But if you’re just chasing the rabbit
around the course, you’re not running toward anything meaningful.”</p>
<p>Intrinsic motivations are congruent with your values and are more
fulfilling than extrinsic motivations. John Thain, CEO of the New York
Stock Exchange, said, “I am motivated by doing a really good job at
whatever I am doing, but I prefer to multiply my impact on society
through a group of people.” Or as Ann Moore, chairman and CEO of Time,
put it, “I came here 25 years ago solely because I loved magazines and
the publishing world.” Moore had a dozen job offers after business
school but took the lowest-paying one with Time because of her passion
for publishing.</p>
<p>Building your support team</p>
<p>Leaders cannot succeed on their own; even the most outwardly
confident executives need support and advice. Without strong
relationships to provide perspective, it is very easy to lose your
way.</p>
<p>Authentic leaders build extraordinary support teams to help them stay
on course. Those teams counsel them in times of uncertainty, help them
in times of difficulty, and celebrate with them in times of success.
After their hardest days, leaders find comfort in being with people on
whom they can rely so they can be open and vulnerable. During the low
points, they cherish the friends who appreciate them for who they are,
not what they are. Authentic leaders find that their support teams
provide affirmation, advice, perspective, and calls for course
corrections when needed.</p>
<p>How do you go about building your support team? Most authentic
leaders have a multifaceted support structure that includes their
spouses or significant others, families, mentors, close friends, and
colleagues. They build their networks over time, as the experiences,
shared histories, and openness with people close to them create the
trust and confidence they need in times of trial and uncertainty.
Leaders must give as much to their supporters as they get from them so
that mutually beneficial relationships can develop.</p>
<p>It starts with having at least one person in your life with whom you
can be completely yourself, warts and all, and still be accepted
unconditionally. Often that person is the only one who can tell you the
honest truth. Most leaders have their closest relationships with their
spouses, although some develop these bonds with another family member, a
close friend, or a trusted mentor. When leaders can rely on
unconditional support, they are more likely to accept themselves for who
they really are.</p>
<p>Many relationships grow over time through an expression of shared
values and a common purpose. Randy Komisar of venture capital firm
Kleiner Perkins Caufield andandandand Byers said his marriage to
Hewlett-Packard’s Debra Dunn is lasting because it is rooted in similar
values. “Debra and I are very independent but extremely harmonious in
terms of our personal aspirations, values, and principles. We have a
strong resonance around questions like, ‘What is your legacy in this
world?’ It is important to be in sync about what we do with our
lives.”</p>
<p>Many leaders have had a mentor who changed their lives. The best
mentoring interactions spark mutual learning, exploration of similar
values, and shared enjoyment. If people are only looking for a leg up
from their mentors, instead of being interested in their mentors’ lives
as well, the relationships will not last for long. It is the two-way
nature of the connection that sustains it.</p>
<p>Personal and professional support groups can take many forms. Piper
Jaffray’s Tad Piper is a member of an Alcoholics Anonymous group. He
noted, “These are not CEOs. They are just a group of nice, hardworking
people who are trying to stay sober, lead good lives, and work with each
other about being open, honest, and vulnerable. We reinforce each
other’s behavior by talking about our chemical dependency in a
disciplined way as we go through the 12 steps. I feel blessed to be
surrounded by people who are thinking about those kinds of issues and
actually doing something, not just talking about them.”</p>
<p>Bill George’s experiences echo Piper’s: In 1974, he joined a men’s
group that formed after a weekend retreat. More than 30 years later, the
group is still meeting every Wednesday morning. After an opening period
of catching up on each other’s lives and dealing with any particular
difficulty someone may be facing, one of the group’s eight members leads
a discussion on a topic he has selected. These discussions are open,
probing, and often profound. The key to their success is that people say
what they really believe without fear of judgment, criticism, or
reprisal. All the members consider the group to be one of the most
important aspects of their lives, enabling them to clarify their
beliefs, values, and understanding of vital issues, as well as serving
as a source of honest feedback when they need it most.</p>
<p>Integrating your life by staying grounded</p>
<p>Integrating their lives is one of the greatest challenges leaders
face. To lead a balanced life, you need to bring together all of its
constituent elements—work, family, community, and friends—so that you
can be the same person in each environment. Think of your life as a
house, with a bedroom for your personal life, a study for your
professional life, a family room for your family, and a living room to
share with your friends. Can you knock down the walls between these
rooms and be the same person in each of them?</p>
<p>As John Donahoe, president of eBay Marketplaces and former worldwide
managing director of Bain, stressed, being authentic means maintaining a
sense of self no matter where you are. He warned, “The world can shape
you if you let it. To have a sense of yourself as you live, you must
make conscious choices. Sometimes the choices are really hard, and you
make a lot of mistakes.”</p>
<p>Authentic leaders have a steady and confident presence. They do not
show up as one person one day and another person the next. Integration
takes discipline, particularly during stressful times when it is easy to
become reactive and slip back into bad habits. Donahoe feels strongly
that integrating his life has enabled him to become a more effective
leader. “There is no nirvana,” he said. “The struggle is constant, as
the trade-offs don’t get any easier as you get older.” But for authentic
leaders, personal and professional lives are not a zero-sum game. As
Donahoe said, “I have no doubt today that my children have made me a far
more effective leader in the workplace. Having a strong personal life
has made the difference.” Leading is high-stress work. There is no way
to avoid stress when you are responsible for people, organizations,
outcomes, and managing the constant uncertainties of the environment.
The higher you go, the greater your freedom to control your destiny but
also the higher the degree of stress. The question is not whether you
can avoid stress but how you can control it to maintain your own sense
of equilibrium.</p>
<p>Authentic leaders are constantly aware of the importance of staying
grounded. Besides spending time with their families and close friends,
authentic leaders get physical exercise, engage in spiritual practices,
do community service, and return to the places where they grew up. All
are essential to their effectiveness as leaders, enabling them to
sustain their authenticity.</p>
<p>Empowering people to lead</p>
<p>Now that we have discussed the process of discovering your authentic
leadership, let’s look at how authentic leaders empower people in their
organizations to achieve superior long-term results, which is the bottom
line for all leaders.</p>
<p>Authentic leaders recognize that leadership is not about their
success or about getting loyal subordinates to follow them. They know
the key to a successful organization is having empowered leaders at all
levels, including those who have no direct reports. They not only
inspire those around them, they empower those individuals to step up and
lead.</p>
<p>A reputation for building relationships and empowering people was
instrumental in chairman and CEO Anne Mulcahy’s stunning turnaround of
Xerox. When Mulcahy was asked to take the company’s reins from her
failed predecessor, Xerox had 8 billion in debt, and all credit lines
were exhausted. With the share price in free fall, morale was at an
all-time low. To make matters worse, the SEC was investigating the
company’s revenue recognition practices.</p>
<p>Mulcahy’s appointment came as a surprise to every one—including
Mulcahy herself. A Xerox veteran, she had worked in field sales and on
the corporate staff for 25 years, but not in finance, RandandandandD, or
manufacturing. How could Mulcahy cope with this crisis when she had had
no financial experience? She brought to the CEO role the relationships
she had built over 25 years, an impeccable understanding of the
organization, and, above all, her credibility as an authentic leader.
She bled for Xerox, and everyone knew it. Because of that, they were
willing to go the extra mile for her.</p>
<p>After her appointment, Mulcahy met personally with the company’s top
100 executives to ask them if they would stay with the company despite
the challenges ahead. “I knew there were people who weren’t supportive
of me,” she said. “So I confronted a couple of them and said, ‘This is
about the company.’”</p>
<p>The first two people Mulcahy talked with, both of whom ran big
operating units, decided to leave, but the remaining 98 committed to
stay. Throughout the crisis, people in Xerox were empowered by Mulcahy
to step up and lead in order to restore the company to its former
greatness. In the end, her leadership enabled Xerox to avoid bankruptcy
as she paid back 0 billion in debt and restored revenue growth and
profitability with a combination of cost savings and innovative new
products. The stock price tripled as a result.</p>
<hr />
<p>Like Mulcahy, all leaders have to deliver bottom-line results. By
creating a virtuous circle in which the results reinforce the
effectiveness of their leadership, authentic leaders are able to sustain
those results through good times and bad. Their success enables them to
attract talented people and align employees’ activities with shared
goals, as they empower others on their team to lead by taking on greater
challenges. Indeed, superior results over a sustained period of time is
the ultimate mark of an authentic leader. It may be possible to drive
short-term outcomes without being authentic, but authentic leadership is
the only way we know to create sustainable long-term results.</p>
<p>For authentic leaders, there are special rewards. No individual
achievement can equal the pleasure of leading a group of people to
achieve a worthy goal. When you cross the finish line together, all the
pain and suffering you may have experienced quickly vanishes. It is
replaced by a deep inner satisfaction that you have empowered others and
thus made the world a better place. That’s the challenge and the
fulfillment of authentic leadership.</p>
