<h4 id="how-to-work-with-someone-whos-always-stressed-out">6 How to Work
with Someone Who’s Always Stressed Out</h4>
<p>By Rebecca Knight</p>
<p>We all know people who seem to be constantly stressed out—who claim
to be buried in work, overloaded with projects, and without a minute to
spare. Colleagues like that can be difficult to work with, but you
probably don’t have a choice. How do you deal with coworkers who can’t
handle stress? Should you address the issue directly? Or try other
tactics to help them calm down and focus? And how can you protect
yourself from their toxic emotions?</p>
<p>What the experts say</p>
<p>Stress is part of everyday life. “We all go through periods when we
are dealing with a lot of stress,” says Caroline Webb, author of How to
Have a Good Day. “Those periods might last 10 minutes, 10 days, or 10
months.” But for certain people, “stress is a habitual pattern.” These
folks always “feel overwhelmed, constantly stretched, and always out of
their depth.” Working closely with a person like this can be a real
challenge. “But you mustn’t make them the villain,” says Holly Weeks,
author of Failure to Communicate. “Don’t think, What can I do to change
this person? Think about how to neutralize the situation and what you
can do for yourself.” Whether you regard your colleague with annoyance
or sympathy, here are some tips on how to collaborate more
effectively.</p>
<p>Don’t judge</p>
<p>First things first: Check that you’re not being too judgmental.
“There’s an enormous range in people’s tolerance level for stress, and
stress that may feel toxic to you may be stimulating to someone else,”
Weeks explains. “So unless you’re a psychologist, judging someone’s way
of handling stress as inappropriate is fraught.” Try to think of your
colleague’s disposition “as not a character flaw but a characteristic.”
Webb notes that your coworker may just be responding to the “always-on
nature of work” nowadays. “There was a time when we could go home and
forget about work until the next day,” but the modern era’s “pressure to
stay connected” weighs on some more than others.</p>
<p>Acknowledge the stress</p>
<p>It’s important to make the stressed-out person feel “seen and heard,”
Webb says. “Say something like, ‘I notice you were working late last
night, and it wasn’t the first time. How are things going?’” Then, after
your colleague recites the usual catalog of pressures, “say, ‘That must
be hard.’ It doesn’t matter if you believe it or not. That’s how this
person is feeling. Acknowledging it gives you both a chance to move
beyond.” At the same time, Weeks says, you mustn’t “enable” or agitate
your colleague by making comments like, “I don’t know how you can you
stand it! This company is working you to death!” That’s not helpful.
Instead, she says, say something more neutral, like “You have a lot of
balls in the air.”</p>
<p>Offer praise</p>
<p>One of the best ways to “get a stressed person out of fight-or-flight
mode [is to] pay a compliment,” Webb says. “This person is feeling out
of control, incompetent, and disrespected. A compliment is your easy way
to help them get back to their better self.” Praising someone’s
performance in the workplace gives the person an alternative “self-image
of being a competent, positive professional,” Weeks adds. Cite something
specific. For instance, you could say, “The way you handled that
presentation last week was admirable. You were so calm and collected and
the clients were impressed.” Appreciation can be a powerful
intervention. “When you tell people how you see them, they step into
that role.”</p>
<p>Offer your assistance</p>
<p>Another strategy is to offer your support. “Say, ‘Is there anything
that I, or anyone on my team, can do to help to you?’” Webb suggests.
“Chances are that you can’t do anything, but your offer will give the
other person a chance to think about solutions and feel that he’s not
out on his own.” Be clear, however, that this isn’t a blanket invitation
to be used anytime, anywhere, Weeks says. “Give caveats about what
you’re able to do.” The message should be, “I’m a limited resource, but
I want to help you if you are in a pickle.”</p>
<p>Break down your requests</p>
<p>When dealing with stressed-out colleagues, think about ways to
“reduce their cognitive load,” Webb says. “Don’t add to their sense of
being overwhelmed.” You might, for instance, shorten your emails to the
person, split your larger requests into several smaller steps, or
encourage the idea of dividing work into manageable chunks. “Be smart
about how you break down your ask,” she adds. But don’t go too far.
You’ll have to reconcile your colleague’s deficiencies with your own
desire and need to complete tasks. After all, “your job is to get done
what you need to get done.”</p>
<p>Ask for a read</p>
<p>If your coworker’s anxieties seem to be having an impact on their
ability to focus—and you’re genuinely worried about their health—ask
them to provide more detail, Weeks recommends. “Say, ‘On a scale of 1 to
10, how worried should I be about your level of stress?’ Signal that you
can’t read how bad it is for them.” The answers may surprise you. “They
may tell you, ‘Oh, this is a 5,’ in which case you don’t need to call an
ambulance. Or they may reveal that their wife has cancer and they’re
going through something very hard.” To a large degree, the roots of the
tension “are none of your business.”</p>
<p>Get some distance</p>
<p>Stress can be contagious, so “have the self-awareness to know the
effect it’s having on you,” Webb says. “When someone is toxic and
draining your energy, you sometimes have to figure out how you can get
distance from that person or limit your interactions with them.” Of
course, this isn’t always easy—particularly if you work in the same
department and are assigned to the same projects. In that case, Weeks
says, look at the bright side of the situation. “When it comes to office
characters, the laconic, laid-back, doesn’t-carry-their-weight type is
the person who’s going to leave you in a jam,” she explains. “While you
may not prefer the stress case’s temperament, it’s less of a
problem.”</p>
<p>Principles to remember</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Offer support by asking if there’s anything you can do to help. This
will help your stressed-out colleague feel less alone.</p>
<p>Improve your colleague’s self-image by offering praise.</p>
<p>Think about ways to reduce the person’s cognitive load by, for
instance, breaking work up into more-manageable chunks.</p>
<p>Don’t:</p>
<p>Judge. Your colleague may express stress differently than you, but
that’s not necessarily a character flaw.</p>
<p>Enable the person. Simply acknowledge the stress, then try to help
your colleague move beyond it.</p>
<p>Get sucked in. Instead, figure out ways to get distance from your
colleague.</p>
<p>Case study #1: Offer your help and perspective</p>
<p>Karoli Hindriks, founder and CEO of Jobbatical, the international job
placement firm, previously worked at a company where she supervised a
highly anxious marketing executive. The colleague—we’ll call her
Jenny—“was so overwhelmed and stressed out by her work that her overall
performance was really beginning to suffer,” Karoli recalls. “Everyone
could see how hard she was working. But I also saw the dark circles
under her eyes, her jumpy mood, and her irritability.”</p>
<p>Karoli knew that it wasn’t her place to judge; Jenny just seemed to
be wired that way. Instead, she offered support and talked about the
work that Jenny had to do in terms of small steps rather than a single
large, daunting task. “I asked her to imagine a messy room that she
needed to clean up. I told her to think of stepping into that room and
seeing the clothes scattered all over the floor, the mountain of candy
wrappers under the bed, and the layer of dust covering every
surface.”</p>
<p>“I told her she had two options: She could give up, fall apart, and
surrender to the mess, or she could pick up the first pair of socks you
see and feel good about being one step closer to cleaning up that mess.
Step by step, inch by inch, item by item, she would create order.”</p>
<p>Karoli says that message got through to Jenny. “I started to see her
sharing more of her small victories and how happy that was making her,”
she says. “Her performance improved drastically, and her team members
felt comfortable communicating with her again.”</p>
<p>Case study #2: Be empathetic and praise your stressed-out colleague’s
strengths</p>
<p>Earlier in her career, Jan Bruce worked as a publisher and editor at
a consumer health and wellness magazine. “It was a high-stress
environment in a pressure-cooker industry,” she recalls. “There were a
lot of big personalities strutting around the office. The culture was
toxic, and people were inclined to be disparaging.”</p>
<p>One of her closest colleagues—we’ll call her Abby—became consumed by
the strain of her job. “She had been very successful in the organization
and had gotten many promotions, so she was under extreme pressure,” Jan
explains. At a certain point, she started working so hard that “she was
unable to focus. The stress was making her sick.”</p>
<p>Jan remembers approaching Abby with a “spirit of empathy” and
concern. “I said, ‘I know that you’re under a lot of pressure. How are
you coping?’ which made Abby want to talk to me and confide in me.”</p>
<p>Through subsequent conversations, Jan saw that Abby was determined to
achieve and be successful, but she also needed to give herself a break
and let some of the stress go. “She had an attitude of, ‘I will overcome
this. If I just work longer and harder, everything will be okay.’”</p>
<p>Jan responded by complimenting Abby’s skills and abilities. “I said,
‘You are doing all of this great work, and you’ve been put in charge of
a whole new division, plus you have four small children at home. No
matter what you’re feeling today, you are enormously smart and
competent. You have to remember that. If you ever forget, I’m here to
remind you.’”</p>
<p>Abby appreciated the support, and the two ultimately developed a
strong working relationship.</p>
<p>Today Jan is the cofounder and CEO of MeQuilibrium, a software
platform that helps companies and workers better manage their
productivity, health, and well-being.</p>
