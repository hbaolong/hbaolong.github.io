<h4 id="what-to-do-when-your-heart-isnt-in-your-work-anymore">2 What to
Do When Your Heart Isn’t in Your Work Anymore</h4>
<p>By Andy Molinsky</p>
<p>In an ideal world, our work lives would be completely fulfilling,
full of meaning, and intrinsically motivating. But what if they’re not?
What if you’re stuck in a job or a career that you once loved, but your
heart isn’t in it anymore?</p>
<p>More people fit this profile than you’d think. According to a 2017
Gallup survey, only one-third of U.S. employees feel engaged at work;
that is, only one in three workers brings a consistently high level of
initiative, commitment, passion, and productivity to their job.1 That
leaves the majority of employees less than satisfied with their
work.</p>
<p>And truth be told, there could be any number of reasons for this
sense of malaise. You might feel stuck doing the same thing over and
over again. You might question the ultimate meaning of the work you’re
doing. You might feel micromanaged or that company leaders don’t know or
care about your learning and growth. Or maybe your own growth and
development since starting your career has caused you to change your
passions and priorities in life.</p>
<p>I see and hear examples of career malaise all the time—in my work
teaching and training people in companies, in discussions following my
corporate talks, and in conversations with my family and friends. Though
the tendency among some of us in this situation is to simply grin and
bear it, current scientific research suggests ways to reimagine—or
reenvision—an uninspired professional existence.</p>
<p>Assess what you want out of your work—at this point in your life</p>
<p>Not everyone wants a high-powered career. In fact, according to
research by Yale associate professor of organizational psychology Amy
Wrzesniewski, people tend to fall into one of three categories: Some see
their work as a career, others see it as just a job, and still others
see it as a calling.2 It’s this third category of people, perhaps
unsurprisingly, who exhibit higher performance and a greater sense of
satisfaction with their jobs. The key for you is to determine what you
care about now—what drives you, what you’re passionate about, what truly
motivates you—and build from there. It’s quite possible that what drove
your career in your twenties is no longer appealing. Don’t force your
40-, 50-, or 60-year-old self into your 20-year-old sense of ambition.
Even if you don’t find your true calling, you will at least increase the
odds of finding a meaningful work experience.</p>
<p>See if parts of your job are “craftable”</p>
<p>There has been considerable research on the idea of job crafting, in
which you tweak certain aspects of your job to gain a greater sense of
meaning and satisfaction. Research by Wrzesniewski and two other
organizational behavior scholars, Justin Berg and Jane Dutton, has shown
that people can be quite imaginative and effective at reimagining the
design of their job in personally meaningful ways.</p>
<p>For example, if you enjoy analysis but not sales, can you adjust your
responsibilities in that direction? If you love interacting with others
but feel lonely, can you find ways to partner more on projects? One
participant from Berg, Dutton, and Wrzesniewski’s research redesigned
her marketing job to include more event planning, even though it wasn’t
originally part of her job. The reason was quite simple: She liked it
and was good at it, and by doing so, she could add value to the company
and to her own work experience.3</p>
<p>Or consider this activity: Imagine that you’re a job architect, and
do a “before” and “after” sketch of your job responsibilities, with the
“before” representing the uninspiring status quo and the “after”
representing future possibilities.4 What novel tweaks can you make to
redesign your job, even slightly? Sometimes even the smallest
adjustments can lead to qualitatively meaningful changes in your work
experience.</p>
<p>Ignite your passion outside of work</p>
<p>It might be a latent hobby you’ve told yourself you don’t have the
time for, a personal project that isn’t related to your job or career,
or a “side hustle” where you can experiment with innovative or
entrepreneurial ideas on a smaller scale. Having an outlet for your
passion outside of work can counterbalance the monotony of the
nine-to-five daily grind. These inspirational endeavors can even have
unintended positive spillover effects at work, giving you energy and
inspiration to craft your job or reengage with parts of it you actually
like.5</p>
<p>If all else fails, make a change</p>
<p>Think about changing your career like you’d think about changing your
house. When you originally bought your house, you had certain
requirements. But since then, your priorities may have changed, or maybe
you have simply outgrown it. Do you move, renovate, or stay put? You can
think the exact same way about your job and career. Have your priorities
and needs changed? Can you tweak or “renovate” your job? Or do you need
to move on?</p>
<p>Of course, if you choose to change your career, you’ll want to think
it through and prepare yourself before jumping in with both feet.
Network with people in professions you might be interested in, get your
finances in order, and test out the new career (perhaps on the weekend
or at night) before making the change. It can feel daunting to change
everything so suddenly, but it’s important to consider the option if
you’re truly feeling a deep sense of malaise at work.</p>
<p>The most important thing, though, if you’re finding your interest
waning at work, is not to lose hope. You can find ways to ignite your
passion again—or at least make slight changes so you won’t feel so
hopeless. You’ll likely be surprised at how resilient and resourceful
you are as you walk down the path of career renovation.</p>
