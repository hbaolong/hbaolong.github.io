Mindfulness for People Who Are Too Busy to Meditate</h4>
<p>By Maria Gonzalez</p>
<p>Mindfulness has become almost a buzzword. But what is it, really?
Quite simply, mindfulness is being present and aware, moment by moment,
regardless of circumstances.</p>
<p>For instance, researchers have found that practicing mindfulness can
reprogram the brain to be more rational and less emotional. When faced
with a decision, meditators who practiced mindfulness showed increased
activity in the posterior insula of the brain, an area linked to
rational decision making. This allowed them to make decisions based more
on fact than emotion. This is good news since other research has found
that reasoning is actually suffused with emotion—the two are
inseparable. What’s more, our positive and negative feelings about
people, things, and ideas arise much more rapidly than our conscious
thoughts—in a matter of milliseconds. We push threatening information
away and hold friendly information close. We apply fight-or-flight
reflexes not only to predators, but also to data itself.</p>
<p>There are specific techniques that you can practice to help you reap
the benefits of mindfulness. You may have heard about a
mindfulness-enhancing technique where you meditate for a period of time
before going about the rest of your day. This is definitely valuable.
But I prefer practicing mindfulness all day, in every circumstance. In
essence, you start living all of life mindfully, and over time there is
no distinction between your formal mindfulness practice and making a
presentation, negotiating a deal, driving your car, working out, or
playing a round of golf.</p>
<p>Try a technique I call “micro meditations.” These are meditations
that can be done several times a day for one to three minutes at a time.
Periodically throughout the day, become aware of your breath. It could
be when you feel yourself getting stressed or overwhelmed, with too much
to do and too little time, or perhaps when you notice yourself becoming
increasingly distracted and agitated.</p>
<p>First, notice the quality of your breathing. Is it shallow or deep?
Are you holding your breath and in so doing perhaps also holding your
stomach? Are you hunching your shoulders?</p>
<p>Next, start breathing so that you are bringing the breath into the
belly. Do not strain. If this feels too unnatural, then try bringing the
breath down into the lower chest. If the mind wanders, gently come back
to the breath—without judging yourself for momentarily losing focus.</p>
<p>You will notice that by regularly practicing this micro meditation
you will become more aware and calmer. You’ll find yourself to be
increasingly mindful, calm, and focused. It’s helpful to create
reminders for yourself to practice these meditations throughout the day.
You can do them two to four times a day, every hour, before you go to a
meeting, or whenever you feel like multitasking is eroding your
concentration—whatever is feasible and feels right to you. Micro
meditations can put you back on track and help you develop your
mindfulness muscle.</p>
<p>A second technique I use is one I call “mindfulness in action.”
Instead of adding a new routine to your day, just experience your day a
little differently by paying attention in a particular way, for seconds
at a time.</p>
<p>For instance, if you’ve ever been in a meeting and suddenly noticed
that you missed what was just said because you were “somewhere else” for
the last few minutes, chances are you weren’t being mindful. Maybe you
were thinking about your next meeting, everything on your to do list, or
an incoming text. Or perhaps you just zoned out. This is incredibly
common. Unfortunately, not being present in this way can cause
misunderstandings, missed opportunities, and wasted time.</p>
<p>The next time you’re in a meeting, try to do nothing but listen for
seconds at a time. This is harder than it sounds, but with practice you
will be able to listen continuously, without a break in concentration.
Whenever you notice that your mind has wandered, come right back to
listening to the voice of the person who is speaking. You may have to
redirect your attention dozens of times in a single meeting—it’s
extremely common. Always bring yourself back gently and with patience.
You are training the mind to be right here, right now.</p>
<p>These techniques can, as I’ve said, rewire the brain. As a result,
three critical things happen. First, your ability to concentrate
increases. Second, you see things with increasing clarity, which
improves your judgment. And third, you develop equanimity. Equanimity
enables you to reduce your physiological and emotional stress and
enhances the likelihood that you will be able to find creative solutions
to problems.</p>
<p>Practicing mindfulness—and reaping its benefits—doesn’t have to be a
big time commitment or require special training. You can start right
now—in this moment.</p>
