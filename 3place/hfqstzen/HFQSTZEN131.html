<h4 id="how-humble-leadership-really-works">13 How Humble Leadership
Really Works</h4>
<p>By Dan Cable</p>
<p>When you’re a leader—no matter how long you’ve been in your role or
how hard the journey was to get there—you are merely overhead unless
you’re bringing out the best in your employees. Unfortunately, many
leaders lose sight of this.</p>
<p>Power, as my colleague Ena Inesi has studied, can cause leaders to
become overly obsessed with outcomes and control and, therefore, treat
their employees as means to an end. As I’ve discovered in my own
research, this ramps up people’s fear—fear of not hitting targets, fear
of losing bonuses, fear of failing. As a consequence, people stop
feeling positive emotions, and their drive to experiment and learn is
stifled.1</p>
<p>Take, for example, a UK food-delivery service that I’ve studied. The
engagement of its drivers, who deliver milk and bread to millions of
customers each day, was dipping while management was becoming
increasingly metric-driven in an effort to reduce costs and improve
delivery times. Each week, managers held weekly performance debriefs
with drivers and went through a list of problems, complaints, and errors
with a clipboard and pen. This was not inspiring on any level, for
either party. And, eventually, the drivers, many of whom had worked for
the company for decades, became resentful.</p>
<p>This type of top-down leadership is outdated and, more importantly,
counterproductive. By focusing too much on control and end goals, and
not enough on their people, leaders are making it more difficult to
achieve their own desired outcomes.</p>
<p>The key, then, is to help people feel purposeful, motivated, and
energized so they can bring their best selves to work.</p>
<p>There are a number of ways to do this, as I outline in my book Alive
at Work. But one of the best ways is to adopt the humble mind-set of a
servant leader. Servant leaders view their key role as serving employees
as they explore and grow, providing tangible and emotional support as
they do so.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, servant leaders have the humility, courage, and
insight to admit that they can benefit from the expertise of others who
have less power than them. They actively seek the ideas and unique
contributions of the employees that they serve. This is how servant
leaders create a culture of learning and an atmosphere that encourages
followers to become the very best they can be.</p>
<p>Humility and servant leadership do not imply that leaders have low
self-esteem or take on an attitude of servility. Instead, servant
leadership emphasizes that the responsibility of a leader is to increase
the ownership, autonomy, and responsibility of followers—to encourage
them to think for themselves and try out their own ideas.</p>
<p>Here’s how to do it.</p>
<p>Ask how you can help employees do their jobs better—and then
listen</p>
<p>It sounds deceptively simple: Rather than telling employees how to do
their jobs better, start by asking them how you can help them do their
jobs better. But the effects of this approach can be powerful.</p>
<p>Consider the food-delivery business I previously mentioned. Once its
traditional model was disrupted by newer delivery companies, the
management team decided that things needed to change. The company needed
to compete on great customer service, but in order to do so, the team
needed the support of their employees who provided the service. And,
they needed ideas that could make the company more competitive.</p>
<p>After meeting with consultants at PricewaterhouseCoopers and some
training, the management team tried a new format for its weekly
performance meetings with the drivers.</p>
<p>The new approach? Instead of nit-picking problems, each manager was
trained to simply ask the drivers, “How can I help you deliver excellent
service?” As shown in the research of Bradley Owens and David Hekman,
leaders need to model these types of servant-minded behaviors to
employees so that employees will better serve customers.2</p>
<p>There was huge skepticism at the beginning, as you can imagine.
Drivers’ dislike of the managers was high, and trust was low. But as
depot managers kept asking, “How can I help you deliver excellent
service?” some drivers started to offer suggestions. For example, one
driver suggested new products like Gogurts and fun string cheese that
parents could get delivered early and pop into their kids’ lunches
before school. Another driver thought of a way to report stock shortages
more quickly so that customers were not left without the groceries they
ordered.</p>
<p>Small changes created a virtuous cycle. As the drivers got credit for
their ideas and saw them put into place, they grew more willing to offer
more ideas, which made the depot managers more impressed and more
respectful, which increased the delivery people’s willingness to give
ideas, and so on. And, depot managers learned that some of the so-called
“mistakes” that drivers were making were actually innovations they had
created to streamline processes and still deliver everything on time.
These innovations helped the company deliver better customer
service.</p>
<p>What it comes down to is this: Employees who do the actual work of
your organization often know better than you how to do a great job.
Respecting their ideas, and encouraging them to try new approaches to
improve work, motivates employees to bring more of themselves to
work.</p>
<p>As one area manager summarized: “We really thought that we knew our
delivery people inside out, but we’ve realized that there was a lot we
were missing. Our weekly customer conversation meetings are now more
interactive and the conversations are more honest and adult in their
approach. It’s hard to put into words the changes we are seeing.”</p>
<p>Create low-risk spaces for employees to think of new ideas</p>
<p>Sometimes the best way for leaders to serve employees—and their
organization—is to create a low-risk space for employees to experiment
with their ideas. By doing so, leaders encourage their people to push on
the boundaries of what they already know.</p>
<p>For example, when Jungkiu Choi moved from Singapore to China to start
his gig as head of consumer banking at Standard Chartered, he learned
that one of the cultural expectations of his new job was to visit the
branches and put pressure on branch managers to cut costs. Branch staff
would spend weeks anxiously preparing for the visit.</p>
<p>Jungkiu changed the nature of these visits. Instead of emphasizing
his formal power, he started showing up at branches unannounced,
starting his visit by serving breakfast to the branch employees. Then,
Jungkiu would hold “huddles” and ask how he could help them improve
their branches. Many branch employees were very surprised and initially
did not know how to react. But Jungkiu’s approach tamped down their
anxiety and encouraged ideation and innovative ideas.</p>
<p>Over the course of one year, Jungkiu visited over 80 branches in 25
cities. His consistency and willingness to help convinced employees who
were skeptical at first. The huddles exposed many simple “pain points”
that he could easily help solve (for example, training for the new bank
systems, or making upgrades to computer memory so that the old computers
could handle the new software).</p>
<p>Other employee innovation ideas were larger. For example, one of the
Shanghai branches was inside a shopping mall. In the huddle, employees
asked Jungkiu if they could open and close at the same time as the
mall’s operating hours (rather than the typical branch operating hours).
The team wanted to experiment with working on the weekends. Within a few
months, this branch’s weekend income generation surpassed its entire
weekday income. This was not an idea that Jungkiu had even imagined.</p>
<p>These experiments paid off in terms of company performance. Customer
satisfaction increased by 54% during the two-year period of Jungkiu’s
humble leadership. Complaints from customers were reduced by 29% during
the same period. The employee attrition ratio, which had been the
highest among all of the foreign banks in China, was reduced to the
lowest among all foreign banks in China.</p>
<p>Be humble</p>
<p>Leaders often do not see the true value of their charges, especially
lower-level workers. But when leaders are humble, show respect, and ask
how they can serve employees as they improve the organization, the
outcomes can be outstanding. And perhaps even more important than better
company results, servant leaders get to act like better human
beings.</p>
