<h4 id="the-power-of-small-wins">4 The Power of Small Wins</h4>
<p>By Teresa M. Amabile and Steven J. Kramer</p>
<p>What is the best way to drive innovative work inside organizations?
Important clues hide in the stories of world-renowned creators. It turns
out that ordinary scientists, marketers, programmers, and other unsung
knowledge workers, whose jobs require creative productivity every day,
have more in common with famous innovators than most managers realize.
The workday events that ignite their emotions, fuel their motivation,
and trigger their perceptions are fundamentally the same.</p>
<p>The Double Helix, James Watson’s 1968 memoir about discovering the
structure of DNA, describes the roller coaster of emotions he and
Francis Crick experienced through the progress and setbacks of the work
that eventually earned them the Nobel Prize. After the excitement of
their first attempt to build a DNA model, Watson and Crick noticed some
serious flaws. According to Watson, “Our first minutes with the models .
. . were not joyous.” Later that evening, “a shape began to emerge which
brought back our spirits.” But when they showed their “breakthrough” to
colleagues, they found that their model would not work. Dark days of
doubt and ebbing motivation followed. When the duo finally had their
bona fide breakthrough, and their colleagues found no fault with it,
Watson wrote, “My morale skyrocketed, for I suspected that we now had
the answer to the riddle.” Watson and Crick were so driven by this
success that they practically lived in the lab, trying to complete the
work.</p>
<p>Throughout these episodes, Watson and Crick’s progress—or lack
thereof—ruled their reactions. In our recent research on creative work
inside businesses, we stumbled upon a remarkably similar phenomenon.
Through exhaustive analysis of diaries kept by knowledge workers, we
discovered the “progress principle”: Of all the things that can boost
emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a workday, the single most
important is making progress in meaningful work. And the more frequently
people experience that sense of progress, the more likely they are to be
creatively productive in the long run. Whether they are trying to solve
a major scientific mystery or simply produce a high-quality product or
service, everyday progress—even a small win—can make all the difference
in how they feel and perform.</p>
<p>The power of progress is fundamental to human nature, but few
managers understand it or know how to leverage progress to boost
motivation. In fact, work motivation has been a subject of long-standing
debate. In a survey asking about the keys to motivating workers, we
found that some managers ranked recognition for good work as most
important, while others put more stock in tangible incentives. Some
focused on the value of interpersonal support, while still others
thought clear goals were the answer. Interestingly, very few of our
surveyed managers ranked progress first. (See the sidebar “A Surprise
for Managers.”)</p>
<p>A SURPRISE FOR MANAGERS</p>
<p>In a 1968 issue of HBR, Frederick Herzberg published a now-classic
article titled “One More Time: How Do you Motivate Employees?” Our
findings are consistent with his message: People are most satisfied with
their jobs (and therefore most motivated) when those jobs give them the
opportunity to experience achievement. The diary research we describe in
this article—in which we microscopically examined the events of
thousands of workdays, in real time—uncovered the mechanism underlying
the sense of achievement: making consistent, meaningful progress.</p>
<p>But managers seem not to have taken Herzberg’s lesson to heart. To
assess contemporary awareness of the importance of daily work progress,
we recently administered a survey to 669 managers of varying levels from
dozens of companies around the world. We asked about the managerial
tools that can affect employees’ motivation and emotions. The
respondents ranked five tools—support for making progress in the work,
recognition for good work, incentives, interpersonal support, and clear
goals—in order of importance.</p>
<p>Of the managers who took our survey, 95% would probably be surprised
to learn that supporting progress is the primary way to elevate
motivation—because that’s the percentage who failed to rank progress
number one. In fact, only 35 managers ranked progress as the number one
motivator—a mere 5%. The vast majority of respondents ranked support for
making progress dead last as a motivator and third as an influence on
emotion. They ranked “recognition for good work (either public or
private)” as the most important factor in motivating workers and making
them happy. In our diary study, recognition certainly did boost inner
work life. But it wasn’t nearly as prominent as progress. Besides,
without work achievements, there is little to recognize.</p>
<p>If you are a manager, the progress principle holds clear implications
for where to focus your efforts. It suggests that you have more
influence than you may realize over employees’ well-being, motivation,
and creative output. Knowing what serves to catalyze and nourish
progress—and what does the opposite—turns out to be the key to
effectively managing people and their work.</p>
<p>In this article, we share what we have learned about the power of
progress and how managers can leverage it. We spell out how a focus on
progress translates into concrete managerial actions and provide a
checklist to help make such behaviors habitual. But to clarify why those
actions are so potent, we first describe our research and what the
knowledge workers’ diaries revealed about their “inner work lives.”</p>
<p>Inner work life and performance</p>
<p>For nearly 15 years, we have been studying the psychological
experiences and the performance of people doing complex work inside
organizations. Early on, we realized that a central driver of creative,
productive performance was the quality of a person’s inner work life:
the mix of emotions, motivations, and perceptions over the course of a
workday. How happy workers feel; how motivated they are by an intrinsic
interest in the work; how positively they view their organization, their
management, their team, their work, and themselves—all these combine
either to push them to higher levels of achievement or to drag them
down.</p>
<p>To understand such interior dynamics better, we asked members of
project teams to respond individually to an end-of-day email survey
during the course of the project—just over four months, on average. (For
more on this research, see our article “Inner Work Life: Understanding
the Subtext of Business Performance,” HBR May 2007.) The
projects—inventing kitchen gadgets, managing product lines of cleaning
tools, and solving complex IT problems for a hotel empire, for
example—all involved creativity. The daily survey inquired about
participants’ emotions and moods, motivation levels, and perceptions of
the work environment that day, as well as what work they did and what
events stood out in their minds.</p>
<p>Twenty-six project teams from seven companies participated,
comprising 238 individuals. This yielded nearly 12,000 diary entries.
Naturally, every individual in our population experienced ups and downs.
Our goal was to discover the states of inner work life and the workday
events that correlated with the highest levels of creative output.</p>
<p>In a dramatic rebuttal to the commonplace claim that high pressure
and fear spur achievement, we found that, at least in the realm of
knowledge work, people are more creative and productive when their inner
work lives are positive—when they feel happy, are intrinsically
motivated by the work itself, and have positive perceptions of their
colleagues and the organization. Moreover, in those positive states,
people are more committed to the work and more collegial toward those
around them. Inner work life, we saw, can fluctuate from one day to the
next—sometimes wildly—and performance along with it. A person’s inner
work life on a given day fuels his or her performance for the day and
can even affect performance the next day.</p>
<p>Once this “inner work-life effect” became clear, our inquiry turned
to whether and how managerial action could set it in motion. What events
could evoke positive or negative emotions, motivations, and perceptions?
The answers were tucked within our research participants’ diary entries.
There are predictable triggers that inflate or deflate inner work life,
and, even accounting for variation among individuals, they are pretty
much the same for everyone.</p>
<p>The power of progress</p>
<p>Our hunt for inner work-life triggers led us to the progress
principle. When we compared our research participants’ best and worst
days (based on their overall mood, specific emotions, and motivation
levels), we found that the most common event triggering a “best day” was
any progress in the work by the individual or the team. The most common
event triggering a “worst day” was a setback.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, how progress relates to one component of inner
work life: overall mood ratings. Steps forward occurred on 76% of
people’s best-mood days. By contrast, setbacks occurred on only 13% of
those days. (See the figure “What happens on good days and bad
days?”)</p>
<p>What happens on good days and bad days?</p>
<p>Progress—even a small step forward—occurs on many of the days people
report being in a good mood. Events on bad days—setbacks and other
hindrances—are nearly the mirror image of those on good days.</p>
<p>Two other types of inner work-life triggers also occur frequently on
best days: catalysts, actions that directly support work, including help
from a person or group, and nourishers, events such as shows of respect
and words of encouragement. Each has an opposite: inhibitors, actions
that fail to support or actively hinder work, and toxins, discouraging
or undermining events. Whereas catalysts and inhibitors are directed at
the project, nourishers and toxins are directed at the person. Like
setbacks, inhibitors and toxins are rare on days of great inner work
life.</p>
<p>Events on worst-mood days are nearly the mirror image of those on
best-mood days. Here, setbacks predominated, occurring on 67% of those
days; progress occurred on only 25% of them. Inhibitors and toxins also
marked many worst-mood days, and catalysts and nourishers were rare.</p>
<p>This is the progress principle made visible: If a person is motivated
and happy at the end of a workday, it’s a good bet that he or she made
some progress. If the person drags out of the office disengaged and
joyless, a setback is most likely to blame.</p>
<p>When we analyzed all 12,000 daily surveys filled out by our
participants, we discovered that progress and setbacks influence all
three aspects of inner work life. On days when they made progress, our
participants reported more positive emotions. They not only were in a
more upbeat mood in general but also expressed more joy, warmth, and
pride. When they suffered setbacks, they experienced more frustration,
fear, and sadness.</p>
<p>Motivations were also affected: On progress days, people were more
intrinsically motivated—by interest in and enjoyment of the work itself.
On setback days, they were not only less intrinsically motivated but
also less extrinsically motivated by recognition. Apparently, setbacks
can lead a person to feel generally apathetic and disinclined to do the
work at all.</p>
<p>Perceptions differed in many ways, too. On progress days, people
perceived significantly more positive challenge in their work. They saw
their teams as more mutually supportive and reported more positive
interactions between the teams and their supervisors. On a number of
dimensions, perceptions suffered when people encountered setbacks. They
found less positive challenge in the work, felt that they had less
freedom in carrying it out, and reported that they had insufficient
resources. On setback days, participants perceived both their teams and
their supervisors as less supportive.</p>
<p>To be sure, our analyses establish correlations but do not prove
causality. Were these changes in inner work life the result of progress
and setbacks, or was the effect the other way around? The numbers alone
cannot answer that. However, we do know, from reading thousands of diary
entries, that more-positive perceptions, a sense of accomplishment,
satisfaction, happiness, and even elation often followed progress.
Here’s a typical post-progress entry, from a programmer: “I smashed that
bug that’s been frustrating me for almost a calendar week. That may not
be an event to you, but I live a very drab life, so I’m all hyped.”</p>
<p>Likewise, we saw that deteriorating perceptions, frustration,
sadness, and even disgust often followed setbacks. As another
participant, a product marketer, wrote, “We spent a lot of time updating
the cost reduction project list, and after tallying all the numbers, we
are still coming up short of our goal. It is discouraging to not be able
to hit it after all the time spent and hard work.”</p>
<p>Almost certainly, the causality goes both ways, and managers can use
this feedback loop between progress and inner work life to support
both.</p>
<p>Minor milestones</p>
<p>When we think about progress, we often imagine how good it feels to
achieve a long-term goal or experience a major breakthrough. These big
wins are great—but they are relatively rare. The good news is that even
small wins can boost inner work life tremendously. Many of the progress
events our research participants reported represented only minor steps
forward. Yet they often evoked outsize positive reactions. Consider this
diary entry from a programmer in a high-tech company, which was
accompanied by very positive self-ratings of her emotions, motivations,
and perceptions that day: “I figured out why something was not working
correctly. I felt relieved and happy because this was a minor milestone
for me.”</p>
<p>Even ordinary, incremental progress can increase people’s engagement
in the work and their happiness during the workday. Across all the types
of events our participants reported, a notable proportion (28%) that had
a minor impact on the project had a major impact on people’s feelings
about it. Because inner work life has such a potent effect on creativity
and productivity, and because small but consistent steps forward shared
by many people can accumulate into excellent execution, progress events
that often go unnoticed are critical to the overall performance of
organizations.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is a flip side. Small losses or setbacks can
have an extremely negative effect on inner work life. In fact, our study
and research by others show that negative events can have a more
powerful impact than positive ones. Consequently, it is especially
important for managers to minimize daily hassles. (See again the figure
“What happens on good days and bad days?”)</p>
<p>Progress in meaningful work</p>
<p>We’ve shown how gratifying it is for workers when they are able to
chip away at a goal, but recall what we said earlier: The key to
motivating performance is supporting progress in meaningful work. Making
headway boosts your inner work life, but only if the work matters to
you.</p>
<p>Think of the most boring job you’ve ever had. Many people nominate
their first job as a teenager—washing pots and pans in a restaurant
kitchen, for example, or checking coats at a museum. In jobs like those,
the power of progress seems elusive. No matter how hard you work, there
are always more pots to wash and coats to check; only punching the time
clock at the end of the day or getting the paycheck at the end of the
week yields a sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>In jobs with much more challenge and room for creativity, like the
ones our research participants had, simply “making progress”—getting
tasks done—doesn’t guarantee a good inner work life, either. You may
have experienced this rude fact in your own job, on days (or in
projects) when you felt demotivated, devalued, and frustrated, even
though you worked hard and got things done. The likely cause is your
perception of the completed tasks as peripheral or irrelevant. For the
progress principle to operate, the work must be meaningful to the person
doing it.</p>
<p>In 1983, Steve Jobs was trying to entice John Sculley to leave a
wildly successful career at PepsiCo to become Apple’s new CEO. Jobs
reportedly asked him, “Do you want to spend the rest of your life
selling sugared water or do you want a chance to change the world?” In
making his pitch, Jobs leveraged a potent psychological force: the
deep-seated human desire to do meaningful work.</p>
<p>Fortunately, to feel meaningful, work doesn’t have to involve putting
the first personal computers in the hands of ordinary people, or
alleviating poverty, or helping to cure cancer. Work with less profound
importance to society can matter if it contributes value to something or
someone important to the worker. Meaning can be as simple as making a
useful and high-quality product for a customer or providing a genuine
service for a community. It can be supporting a colleague or boosting an
organization’s profits by reducing inefficiencies in a production
process. Whether the goals are lofty or modest, as long as they are
meaningful to the worker and it is clear how his or her efforts
contribute to them, progress toward them can galvanize inner work
life.</p>
<p>In principle, managers shouldn’t have to go to extraordinary lengths
to infuse jobs with meaning. Most jobs in modern organizations are
potentially meaningful for the people doing them. However, managers can
make sure that employees know just how their work is contributing. And,
most important, they can avoid actions that negate its value. (See the
sidebar “How Work Gets Stripped of Its Meaning.”) All the participants
in our research were doing work that should have been meaningful; no one
was washing pots or checking coats. Shockingly often, however, we saw
potentially important, challenging work losing its power to inspire.</p>
<p>HOW WORK GETS STRIPPED OF ITS MEANING</p>
<p>Diary entries from 238 knowledge workers who were members of creative
project teams revealed four primary ways in which managers unwittingly
drain work of its meaning.</p>
<p>Managers may dismiss the importance of employees’ work or ideas.
Consider the case of Richard, a senior lab technician at a chemical
company, who found meaning in helping his new-product development team
solve complex technical problems. However, in team meetings over the
course of a three-week period, Richard perceived that his team leader
was ignoring his suggestions and those of his teammates. As a result, he
felt that his contributions were not meaningful, and his spirits
flagged. When at last he believed that he was again making a substantive
contribution to the success of the project, his mood improved
dramatically: “I felt much better at today’s team meeting. I felt that
my opinions and information were important to the project and that we
have made some progress.”</p>
<p>They may destroy employees’ sense of ownership of their work.
Frequent and abrupt reassignments often have this effect. This happened
repeatedly to the members of a product development team in a giant
consumer products company, as described by team member Bruce: “As I’ve
been handing over some projects, I do realize that I don’t like to give
them up. Especially when you have been with them from the start and are
nearly to the end. You lose ownership. This happens to us way too
often.”</p>
<p>Managers may send the message that the work employees are doing will
never see the light of day. They can signal this—unintentionally—by
shifting their priorities or changing their minds about how something
should be done. We saw the latter in an internet technology company
after user-interface developer Burt had spent weeks designing seamless
transitions for non-English-speaking users. Not surprisingly, Burt’s
mood was seriously marred on the day he reported this incident: “Other
options for the international [interfaces] were [given] to the team
during a team meeting, which could render the work I am doing
useless.”</p>
<p>They may neglect to inform employees about unexpected changes in a
customer’s priorities. Often, this arises from poor customer management
or inadequate communication within the company. For example, Stuart, a
data transformation expert at an IT company, reported deep frustration
and low motivation on the day he learned that weeks of the team’s hard
work might have been for naught: “Found out that there is a strong
possibility that the project may not be going forward, due to a shift in
the client’s agenda. Therefore, there is a strong possibility that all
the time and effort put into the project was a waste of our time.”</p>
<p>Supporting progress:</p>
<p>catalysts and nourishers</p>
<p>What can managers do to ensure that people are motivated, committed,
and happy? How can they support workers’ daily progress? They can use
catalysts and nourishers, the other kinds of frequent “best day” events
we discovered.</p>
<p>Catalysts are actions that support work. They include setting clear
goals, allowing autonomy, providing sufficient resources and time,
helping with the work, openly learning from problems and successes, and
allowing a free exchange of ideas. Their opposites, inhibitors, include
failing to provide support and actively interfering with the work.
Because of their impact on progress, catalysts and inhibitors ultimately
affect inner work life. But they also have a more immediate impact: When
people realize that they have clear and meaningful goals, sufficient
resources, helpful colleagues, and so on, they get an instant boost to
their emotions, their motivation to do a great job, and their
perceptions of the work and the organization.</p>
<p>Nourishers are acts of interpersonal support, such as respect and
recognition, encouragement, emotional comfort, and opportunities for
affiliation. Toxins, their opposites, include disrespect,
discouragement, disregard for emotions, and interpersonal conflict. For
good and for ill, nourishers and toxins affect inner work life directly
and immediately.</p>
<p>Catalysts and nourishers—and their opposites—can alter the
meaningfulness of work by shifting people’s perceptions of their jobs
and even themselves. For instance, when a manager makes sure that people
have the resources they need, it signals to them that what they are
doing is important and valuable. When managers recognize people for the
work they do, it signals that they are important to the organization. In
this way, catalysts and nourishers can lend greater meaning to the
work—and amplify the operation of the progress principle.</p>
<p>The managerial actions that constitute catalysts and nourishers are
not particularly mysterious; they may sound like Management 101, if not
just common sense and common decency. But our diary study reminded us
how often they are ignored or forgotten. Even some of the more attentive
managers in the companies we studied did not consistently provide
catalysts and nourishers. For example, a supply chain specialist named
Michael was, in many ways and on most days, an excellent subteam
manager. But he was occasionally so overwhelmed that he became toxic
toward his people. When a supplier failed to complete a “hot” order on
time and Michael’s team had to resort to air shipping to meet the
customer’s deadline, he realized that the profit margin on the sale
would be blown. In irritation, he lashed out at his subordinates,
demeaning the solid work they had done and disregarding their own
frustration with the supplier. In his diary, he admitted as much: “As of
Friday, we have spent 8,000 in air freight to send 1,500 0 spray jet
mops to our number two customer. Another 2,800 remain on this order, and
there is a good probability that they too will gain wings. I have turned
from the kindly supply chain manager into the black-masked executioner.
All similarity to civility is gone, our backs are against the wall,
flight is not possible, therefore fight is probable.”</p>
<p>Even when managers don’t have their backs against the wall,
developing long-term strategy and launching new initiatives can often
seem more important—and perhaps sexier—than making sure subordinates
have what they need to make steady progress and feel supported as human
beings. But as we saw repeatedly in our research, even the best strategy
will fail if managers ignore the people working in the trenches to
execute it.</p>
<p>A model manager—and a</p>
<p>tool for emulating him</p>
<p>We could explain the many (and largely unsurprising) moves that can
catalyze progress and nourish spirits, but it may be more useful to give
an example of a manager who consistently used those moves—and then to
provide a simple tool that can help any manager do so.</p>
<p>Our model manager is Graham, whom we observed leading a small team of
chemical engineers within a multinational European firm we’ll call
Kruger-Bern. The mission of the team’s NewPoly project was clear and
meaningful enough: Develop a safe, biodegradable polymer to replace
petrochemicals in cosmetics and, eventually, in a wide range of consumer
products. As in many large firms however, the project was nested in a
confusing and sometimes threatening corporate setting of shifting
top-management priorities, conflicting signals, and wavering
commitments. Resources were uncomfortably tight, and uncertainty loomed
over the project’s future—and every team member’s career. Even worse, an
incident early in the project, in which an important customer reacted
angrily to a sample, left the team reeling. Yet Graham was able to
sustain team members’ inner work lives by repeatedly and visibly
removing obstacles, materially supporting progress, and emotionally
supporting the team.</p>
<p>Graham’s management approach excelled in four ways. First, he
established a positive climate, one event at a time, which set
behavioral norms for the entire team. When the customer complaint
stopped the project in its tracks, for example, he engaged immediately
with the team to analyze the problem, without recriminations, and
develop a plan for repairing the relationship. In doing so, he modeled
how to respond to crises in the work: not by panicking or pointing
fingers but by identifying problems and their causes and developing a
coordinated action plan. This is both a practical approach and a great
way to give subordinates a sense of forward movement even in the face of
the missteps and failures inherent in any complex project.</p>
<p>Second, Graham stayed attuned to his team’s everyday activities and
progress. In fact, the nonjudgmental climate he had established made
this happen naturally. Team members updated him frequently—without being
asked—on their setbacks, progress, and plans. At one point, one of his
hardest-working colleagues, Brady, had to abort a trial of a new
material because he couldn’t get the parameters right on the equipment.
It was bad news, because the New-Poly team had access to the equipment
only one day a week, but Brady immediately informed Graham. In his diary
entry that evening, Brady noted, “He didn’t like the lost week but
seemed to understand.” That understanding assured Graham’s place in the
stream of information that would allow him to give his people just what
they needed to make progress.</p>
<p>Third, Graham targeted his support according to recent events in the
team and the project. Each day, he could anticipate what type of
intervention—a catalyst or the removal of an inhibitor; a nourisher or
some antidote to a toxin—would have the most impact on team members’
inner work lives and progress. And if he could not make that judgment,
he asked. Most days it was not hard to figure out, as on the day he
received some uplifting news about his bosses’ commitment to the
project. He knew the team was jittery about a rumored corporate
reorganization and could use the encouragement. Even though the
clarification came during a well-earned vacation day, he immediately got
on the phone to relay the good news to the team.</p>
<p>Finally, Graham established himself as a resource for team members
rather than a micromanager; he was sure to check in while never seeming
to check up on them. Superficially, checking in and checking up seem
quite similar, but micromanagers make four kinds of mistakes. First,
they fail to allow autonomy in carrying out the work. Unlike Graham, who
gave the NewPoly team a clear strategic goal but respected members’
ideas about how to meet it, micromanagers dictate every move. Second,
they frequently ask subordinates about their work without providing any
real help. By contrast, when one of Graham’s team members reported
problems, Graham helped analyze them—remaining open to alternative
interpretations—and often ended up helping to get things back on track.
Third, micromanagers are quick to affix personal blame when problems
arise, leading subordinates to hide problems rather than honestly
discuss how to surmount them, as Graham did with Brady. And fourth,
micromanagers tend to hoard information to use as a secret weapon. Few
realize how damaging this is to inner work life. When subordinates
perceive that a manager is withholding potentially useful information,
they feel infantilized, their motivation wanes, and their work is
handicapped. Graham was quick to communicate upper management’s views of
the project, customers’ opinions and needs, and possible sources of
assistance or resistance within and outside the organization.</p>
<p>In all those ways, Graham sustained his team’s positive emotions,
intrinsic motivation, and favorable perceptions. His actions serve as a
powerful example of how managers at any level can approach each day
determined to foster progress.</p>
<p>We know that many managers, however well-intentioned, will find it
hard to establish the habits that seemed to come so naturally to Graham.
Awareness, of course, is the first step. However, turning an awareness
of the importance of inner work life into routine action takes
discipline. With that in mind, we developed a checklist for managers to
consult on a daily basis (see the sidebar “The Daily Progress
Checklist”). The aim of the checklist is managing for meaningful
progress, one day at a time.</p>
<p>The progress loop</p>
<p>Inner work life drives performance; in turn, good performance, which
depends on consistent progress, enhances inner work life. We call this
the “progress loop”—it reveals the potential for self-reinforcing
benefits.</p>
<p>So, the most important implication of the progress principle is this:
By supporting people and their daily progress in meaningful work,
managers improve not only the inner work lives of their employees but
also the organization’s long-term performance, which enhances inner work
life even more. Of course, there is a dark side—the possibility of
negative feedback loops. If managers fail to support progress and the
people trying to make it, inner work life suffers and so does
performance; and degraded performance further undermines inner work
life.</p>
<p>A second implication of the progress principle is that managers
needn’t fret about trying to read the psyches of their workers or
manipulate complicated incentive schemes to ensure that employees are
motivated and happy. As long as managers show basic respect and
consideration, they can focus on supporting the work itself.</p>
<p>To become an effective manager, you must learn to set this positive
feedback loop in motion. That may require a significant shift. Business
schools, business books, and managers themselves usually focus on
managing organizations or people. But if you focus on managing progress,
the management of people—and even of entire organizations—becomes much
more feasible. You won’t have to figure out how to x-ray the inner work
lives of subordinates; if you facilitate their steady progress in
meaningful work, make that progress salient to them, and treat them
well, they will experience the emotions, motivations, and perceptions
necessary for great performance. Their superior work will contribute to
organizational success. And here’s the beauty of it: They will love
their jobs.</p>

<p>THE DAILY PROGRESS CHECKLIST</p>
<p>Near the end of each workday, use this checklist to review the day
and plan your managerial actions for the next day. After a few days, you
will be able to identify issues by scanning the boldface words.</p>
<p>First, focus on progress and setbacks and think about specific events
(catalysts, nourishers, inhibitors, and toxins) that contributed to
them. Next, consider any clear inner-work-life clues and what further
information they provide about progress and other events. Finally,
prioritize for action.</p>
<p>The action plan for the next day is the most important part of your
daily review: What is the one thing you can do to best facilitate
progress?</p>
<p>Progress</p>
<p>Which 1 or 2 events today indicated either a small win or a possible
breakthrough? (Describe briefly.)</p>
<p>Catalysts</p>
<p>Did the team have clear short- and long-term goals for meaningful
work?</p>
<p>Did team members have sufficient autonomy to solve problems and take
ownership of the project?</p>
<p>Did they have all the resources they needed to move forward
efficiently?</p>
<p>Did they have sufficient time to focus on meaningful work?</p>
<p>Did I discuss lessons from today’s successes and problems with my
team?</p>
<p>Did I give or get them help when they needed or requested it? Did I
encourage team members to help one another?</p>
<p>Did I help ideas flow freely within the group?</p>
<p>Nourishers</p>
<p>Did I show respect to team members by recognizing their contributions
to progress, attending to their ideas, and treating them as trusted
professionals?</p>
<p>Did I encourage team members who faced difficult challenges?</p>
<p>Did I support team members who had a personal or professional
problem?</p>
<p>Is there a sense of personal and professional affiliation and
camaraderie within the team?</p>
<p>Setbacks</p>
<p>Which 1 or 2 events today indicated either a small setback or a
possible crisis? (Describe briefly.)</p>
<p>Inhibitors</p>
<p>Was there any confusion regarding long- or short-term goals for
meaningful work?</p>
<p>Were team members overly constrained in their ability to solve
problems and feel ownership of the project?</p>
<p>Did they lack any of the resources they needed to move forward
effectively?</p>
<p>Did they lack sufficient time to focus on meaningful work?</p>
<p>Did I or others fail to provide needed or requested help?</p>
<p>Did I “punish” failure or neglect to find lessons and/or
opportunities in problems and successes?</p>
<p>Did I or others cut off the presentation or debate of ideas
prematurely?</p>
<p>Toxins</p>
<p>Did I disrespect any team members by failing to recognize their
contributions to progress, not attending to their ideas, or not treating
them as trusted professionals?</p>
<p>Did I discourage a member of the team in any way?</p>
<p>Did I neglect a team member who had a personal or professional
problem?</p>
<p>Is there tension or antagonism among members of the team or between
team members and me?</p>
