Figure Out How Much Influence You Have at Work</h4>
<p>By Maxim Sytch</p>
<p>A banker in Southeast Asia wanted to allow employees of a car rental
agency to buy used cars from the employer. But not a single business
unit was able to put together that product. Dif fer ent departments were
stopped by the existing product portfolio, the underlying risk, or
regulatory guidelines. One of the banker’s colleagues, however, was able
to facilitate valuable introductions across the company. That led to the
solution being codesigned and jointly offered by two business units.</p>
<p>Credit the success of this new financial product to the banker’s
informal power. Informal power—which is unrelated to your formal
title—can enable you to mobilize resources, drive change, and create
value for the organization as well as yourself. And in the modern
workplace, informal power is increasingly pivotal and can secure your
place within your organization.</p>
<p>Why? Nowadays, workflow is migrating from specialized verticals to
the white spaces between them, as companies respond more precisely to
customer needs. This trend matters in organizations with
cross-functional teams, account managers, or a matrix structure. Even
smaller organizations are increasingly project driven.</p>
<p>And more and more, work is done outside the organization in
collaboration with suppliers, distributors, and customers. Companies are
crowdsourcing ideas and work. We engage with freelancers and third
parties. Sometimes we even collaborate with competitors.</p>
<p>The fact is, your formal title, direct reports, and formally granted
authority do not always carry you far when working across your own
organization and with outside stakeholders.</p>
<p>Do you have the informal power to generate value and get things done?
Here’s how to do a power audit:</p>
<p>Step 1: List your top 10 contacts that enable you to get work done.
These contacts can be either internal or external to your
organization.</p>
<p>Step 2: For each contact, assign a score from 1 to 10 indicating how
much you depend on them. If a contact provides a lot of value and is
also difficult to replace, assign a high score. Think broadly about the
value your contacts offer. This includes career advice, emotional
backing, support with daily activities, information, and access to
resources or stakeholders.</p>
<p>Step 3: Do the same in reverse. Assign a score to yourself from
others’ perspectives. Approximate how much value you offer your contacts
and how difficult it would be to replace you. Be honest.</p>
<p>Next, look for red flags in your power audit. These could indicate
that you lack informal power and are replaceable.</p>
<p>Do all of your contacts work in one team, function, product unit, or
office building? This could indicate a limited ability to generate value
beyond the basic requirements of your job description.</p>
<p>Do your contacts provide you with more value than you return? Such
relationships are difficult to sustain in the long run. Asymmetries in
dependence indicate others hold the power in a relationship.</p>
<p>Are your dependence scores low throughout? This could indicate the
prevalence of transactional relationships, ones often driven by quid pro
quo. In contrast, high-dependence relationships can be imbued with
values and relational dynamics that are not simply calculated.1</p>
<p>Is all of the value you give or receive concentrated in a couple of
contacts? You could be vulnerable if you lose these contacts or your
relationship changes. One senior executive shared with me that two key
contacts drove the value in his network. Unfortunately, one passed away
and the other moved to a different region. This executive’s informal
power shut down overnight.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, now that you’ve conducted your informal power audit, how can you
improve your standing?</p>
<p>First of all, a prime way to rectify unfavorable power audit scores
is to earn relationships by delivering value to your contacts. Ask
yourself: What value can you deliver to them? One way is to develop and
continuously improve upon a skill set that leads others to value your
contributions. Then proactively use your skills to help others, well
beyond the demands of your formal role. You don’t want to be the expert
whom nobody knows.</p>
<p>Second, let your job help you. Manage your job description so that
you can contribute to the workflows of multiple functions inside the
organization as well as customers, outside partners, or regulators.
Volunteer for cross-functional initiatives. View lateral transfers as a
move up. By positioning yourself at the intersection of workflows, you
set yourself up to meet, learn from, and deliver value to a variety of
diverse groups in the organization.</p>
<p>Third, get to know your stakeholders and collaborators better as
individuals. You may be surprised how something that is rather easy for
you to do carries significant value for them. Sometimes we freeze
because we believe that we have to offer really significant
contributions or do massive favors for others. Knowing others well can
present us with helpful alternatives. And don’t limit yourself to the
professional domain.</p>
<p>Outside of work, join social associations as well as professional
ones. Shared activities have an underestimated impact on expanding our
networks beyond an insular group of immediate coworkers. A friend of
mine, an entrepreneur, first learned from his swim club partner about
venture capital firms’ criteria for selecting and funding life science
companies. That partner ended up being his first investor.</p>
<p>Your value should not be defined solely by your ability to perform a
formal organizational role. If it is, you are likely in trouble—sooner
or later, a cheaper, younger, and smarter competitor will join the
company. By creating value for diverse stakeholders and making yourself
irreplaceable, you open possibilities for yourself within the
organization and beyond. And, by doing so, you add value to your
company.</p>

influence within and between organizations.</p>
