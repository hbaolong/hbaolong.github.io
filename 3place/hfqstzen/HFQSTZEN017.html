<h4 id="understand-the-four-components-of-influence">1 Understand the
Four Components of Influence</h4>
<p>By Nick Morgan</p>
<p>We’ve all encountered people who say less but what they say matters
more; people who know how to use silence to dominate an exchange. So
having influence means more than just doing all the talking; it’s about
taking charge and understanding the roles that positional power,
emotion, expertise, and nonverbal signals play. These four aspects of
influence are essential to master if you want to succeed as a
leader.</p>
<p>Take positional power. If you have it, influence becomes a relatively
simple proposition. People with power over others tend to talk more, to
interrupt more, and to guide the conversation more, by picking the
topics, for example.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the positional power in a particular situation,
then, expect to talk less, interrupt less, and choose the topics of
conversation less. After all, exercising their right to talk more about
the subjects they care for is one of the ways that people with
positional power demonstrate it.</p>
<p>What do you do if you want to challenge the positional authority?
Perhaps you have a product, or an idea, or a company you want to sell,
and you have the ear of someone who can buy it. How do you get control
in that kind of situation?</p>
<p>The second aspect of influence is emotion, and using it is one way to
counteract positional power and generally to dominate a conversation.
When the other side has the power and you have the emotion, something
closer to parity is possible. Indeed, passion can sweep away authority,
when it’s well supported and the speaker is well prepared. We’ve all
witnessed that happen when a young unknown performer disarms and woos
the judges, devastating the competition, in one of those talent
competitions. The purity and power of the emotion in the performance is
enough to silence—and enlist—the judges despite their positional
authority. Indeed, the impassioned speech, the plea for clemency, the
summation to the jury that brings them to tears and wins the case for
the defendant—this is the stuff of Hollywood climaxes.</p>
<p>Passion often links with expertise, the third aspect of influence.
And indeed, you can dominate the conversation, beating out positional
power, if you have both passion and expertise. The diffident expert’s
voice is sometimes lost in the clamor of people wanting to be heard. So
expertise without passion is not always effective, but if it’s patient,
it can be the last person standing in a debate and thereby get its
turn.</p>
<p>The final aspect of influence is the subtlest of the four and as such
rarely can trump either positional authority or passion. But in rare
instances, artfully manipulated, I have seen it prevail. What is it? It
is the mastery of the dance of human interaction.</p>
<p>We have very little conscious awareness of this aspect of influence,
but we are all participants in it with more or less expertise. We learn
at a very early age that conversation is a pas de deux, a game that two
(or more) people play that involves breathing, winking, nodding, eye
contact, head tilts, hand gestures, and a whole series of subtle
nonverbal signals that help both parties communicate with each
other.</p>
<p>Indeed, conversation is much less functional with out these nonverbal
signals. That’s why phone conversations are nowhere near as satisfying
as in-person encounters and why conference calls inevitably involve lots
more interruptions, miscues, and cross talking. We’re not getting the
signals we’re used to getting to help us know when the other person is
ready to hand the conversational baton on to us, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Can you manage influence only using this fourth aspect? I have seen
it done in certain situations, but the other three aspects will usually
trump this one. Nonetheless, I once watched a senior executive
effortlessly dominate a roomful of people who were ostensibly equal—a
group of researchers gathered from around the world to discuss the
future of IT. Within a few minutes, everyone in the room was
unconsciously deferring to this executive, even though he had no
positional power and was not particularly passionate about the subject.
His mastery of the subtle signals of conversational cuing was profound,
and soon he had everyone dancing to his verbal beat. It was beautiful to
watch; he showed complete conversational mastery in action.</p>
<p>Influence, then, is a measure of how much skin the participants have
in the game, and most of us are unconscious experts at measuring it. To
wield it, you need to have the edge in at least one of its four
aspects—and preferably more than one.</p>
