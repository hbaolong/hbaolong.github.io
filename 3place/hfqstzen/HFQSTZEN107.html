<h4 id="your-brain-can-only-take-so-much-focus">10 Your Brain Can Only
Take So Much Focus</h4>
<p>By Srini Pillay</p>
<p>The ability to focus is an important driver of excellence. Focused
techniques such as to-do lists, timetables, and calendar reminders all
help people stay on task. Few would argue with that, and even if they
did, there is evidence to support the idea that resisting distraction
and staying present have benefits. Practicing mindfulness for 10 minutes
a day, for example, can enhance leadership effectiveness by helping you
become more able to regulate your emotions and make sense of past
experiences.1 Yet as helpful as focus can be, there’s also a downside to
focus as it is commonly viewed.</p>
<p>The problem is that excessive focus exhausts the focus circuits in
your brain. It can drain your energy and make you lose control.2 This
energy drain can also make you more impulsive and less helpful.3 As a
result, decisions are poorly thought out, and you become less
collaborative.</p>
<p>So what do we do then? Focus or unfocus?</p>
<p>Recent research shows that both focus and unfocus are vital. The
brain operates optimally when it toggles between focus and unfocus,
allowing us to develop resilience, enhance creativity, and make better
decisions.4</p>
<p>When you unfocus, you engage a brain circuit called the “default mode
network” (DMN). We used to think of this circuit as the “do mostly
nothing” circuit because it only came on when you stopped focusing with
effort. Yet when “at rest,” this circuit uses 20% of the body’s energy
(compared with the comparatively small 5% that any effort would
require).5</p>
<p>The DMN needs this energy because it is doing anything but resting.
Under the brain’s conscious radar, it activates old memories; goes back
and forth between the past, present, and future; and recombines
different ideas.6 Using this new and previously in accessible data, you
develop enhanced self-awareness and a sense of personal relevance.7 And
you can imagine creative solutions or predict what might happen in the
future, thereby leading to better decision-making too.8 The DMN also
helps you tune in to other people’s thinking, thereby improving team
understanding and cohesion.9</p>
<p>There are many simple and effective ways to activate this circuit in
the course of a day. Here are some examples.</p>
<p>Using positive constructive daydreaming (PCD)</p>
<p>Positive constructive daydreaming (PCD) is a type of mind wandering
that is different from slipping into a daydream or guiltily rehashing
worries.10 When you build PCD into your day deliberately, it can boost
your creativity, strengthen your leadership ability, and also reenergize
the brain. To activate PCD, you choose a low-key activity such as
knitting, gardening, or casual reading, then wander into the recesses of
your mind.11 But unlike slipping into a daydream or guilty-dysphoric
daydreaming, you might first imagine something playful and wishful—like
running through the woods, or lying on a yacht. Then you swivel your
attention from the external world to the internal space of your mind
with this image in mind while still doing the low-key activity.</p>
<p>Studied for decades by psychologist Jerome Singer, PCD activates the
DMN and metaphorically changes the silverware that your brain uses to
find information.12 While focused attention is like a fork that picks up
obvious conscious thoughts that you have, PCD commissions a different
set of silverware: a spoon for scooping up the delicious mélange of
flavors of your identity (the scent of your grandmother, the feeling of
satisfaction with the first bite of apple pie on a crisp fall day),
chopsticks for connecting ideas across your brain (to enhance
innovation), and a marrow spoon for getting into the nooks and crannies
of your brain to pick up long-lost memories that are a vital part of
your identity.13 In this state, your sense of self is enhanced—which,
according to organizational consultant Warren Bennis, is the essence of
leadership.14 I call this the psychological center of gravity, a
grounding mechanism (part of your mental “six-pack”) that helps you
enhance your agility and manage change more effectively.15</p>
<p>Taking a nap</p>
<p>In addition to building in time for PCD, leaders can also consider
authorized napping. Not all naps are the same. When your brain is in a
slump, your clarity and creativity are compromised. After a 10-minute
nap, studies show, you become much clearer and more alert.16 But if it’s
a creative task you have in front of you, you will likely need a full 90
minutes of sleep for more complete brain refreshing.17 Your brain
requires this longer time to make more associations and dredge up ideas
that reside in the nooks and crannies of your memory network.</p>
<p>Pretending to be someone else</p>
<p>When you’re stuck in a creative process, unfocus can come to the
rescue if you embody and live out an entirely different personality. In
2016, educational psychologists Denis Dumas and Kevin Dunbar found that
people who try to solve creative problems are more successful if they
behave like an eccentric poet than a rigid librarian.18 Given a test in
which they had to come up with as many uses as possible for any object
(such as a brick), those who behaved like eccentric poets had superior
creative performance. This finding holds even if the same person takes
on a different identity.</p>
<p>When you’re in a creative deadlock, try embodying a different
identity. It will likely get you out of your own head and allow you to
think from another person’s perspective. (I call this “psychological
halloweenism.”)19</p>
<p>For years, focus has been the venerated ability amongst all
abilities. Since we spend 46.9% of our days with our minds wandering
away from a task at hand, we crave the ability to keep it fixed and on
task.20 Yet, if we built PCD, 10- and 90-minute naps, and psychological
halloweenism into our days, we would likely preserve focus for when we
needed it, and use it much more efficiently too. More important, unfocus
would allow us to update information in the brain, giving us access to
deeper parts of ourselves and enhancing our agility, creativity, and
decision-making.</p>
