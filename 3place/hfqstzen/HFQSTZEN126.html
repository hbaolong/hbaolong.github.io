<h4 id="how-to-work-with-a-manipulative-person">8 How to Work with a
Manipulative Person</h4>
<p>By Liz Kislik</p>
<p>Almost everyone who’s ever gone to work has had to deal with an
office manipulator. Unfortunately, most employees hesitate to go public
with their concerns. And with good reason: Even if they do, typical
corporate responses range from wary or dismissive to actually
retaliating against the victim, rather than the wrongdoer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many workplaces promote manipulators because they
appear to be effective at getting things done, despite the significant
costs their abuse can inflict on productivity and people over time.1
Particularly when you can’t get the hierarchy or other authorities to
intervene on your behalf, it helps to have your own approaches for
coping, short of legal action.</p>
<p>Over almost 30 years of consulting, I’ve encountered countless
examples of manipulation, bullying, and inappropriate use of power.
Three kinds of responses have proven to be consistently effective for
confronting most garden-variety manipulators, even if you have less
rank, power, or status. At a minimum, they’ll help you assert yourself
and regain a sense of control rather than suffering in silence while you
figure out your long-term plan.</p>
<p>First, be skeptical about receiving too much special attention</p>
<p>Manipulators don’t usually show their true colors at the beginning of
a relationship. In fact, they often present themselves as allies or
confidantes, because they need to draw you close to size up where your
soft spots are and how much they can get from you. They’re skilled at
assessing which employees are sophisticated and confident enough to
stand on their own and which ones are eager to please or easy to
shame.</p>
<p>It’s exciting if a powerful colleague or superior seems interested in
you, but if you’ve heard scary things about them, it’s sensible to
proceed with caution. In particular, note if someone treats you as their
favorite—but includes little digs that make you feel bad about yourself,
puts you down when talking with others, or pressures you to act against
your own interests to stay on their good side.</p>
<p>One C-level executive I worked with was hurt by a colleague who
claimed to be her supporter and good friend but constantly pointed out
imperfections and mistakes in a way that seemed helpful at first but
eventually undercut her confidence. Over time, she began to doubt her
own instincts and started acting like the manipulative colleague’s
sidekick rather than championing her own causes.</p>
<p>By the time the weaker executive recognized what was going on, she
had trouble separating herself from her colleague and lost a significant
amount of status and clout with her peers. Her credibility and
self-image were shaken, and she was not able to regain her footing or
influence until she left the company.</p>
<p>Second, be willing to risk small public confrontations</p>
<p>Sometimes the only way to expose a manipulator’s maneuverings is by
confronting them in the moment. It can be hard to do this if you’re the
junior party. Even senior people can be stunned into disbelief, or might
be unable to think of what to say when someone is subverting normal
standards of behavior and fair play, despite the organizational damage
they know is being done. So when someone has both the moxie and the wit
to intervene, it puts the manipulator on notice that their behavior has
been detected, and it shows observers that it’s possible to intervene
and keep others safe while moving the business forward.</p>
<p>During one client meeting I attended, an executive was making a
report by phone while the rest of the leadership team was physically
present. At one point, a vice president who had an extremely
self-serving and manipulative reputation raised his eyebrows in apparent
surprise, shook his head repeatedly, and at the end shrugged, as if to
indicate to his peers in the room that he either didn’t agree with what
his colleague was saying or didn’t understand why he was saying it—all
without him saying a word.</p>
<p>The vice president on the phone had no idea that his credibility and
content were being disparaged. I asked the manipulator directly, “Was
there something you wanted to add? You looked like you disagreed
strongly with what we just heard. Did you want to counter either the
conclusion or any of the specifics, or are you comfortable with the
report?”</p>
<p>The vice president in the room denied having any disagreement, but he
was clearly uncomfortable at being put on the spot and could no longer
lord it over or cast aspersions on his colleague. And his colleague was
tipped off to the possibility that he had been undermined.</p>
<p>Third, refuse to keep secrets or to act as interpreter in ways that
normalize underhanded behavior</p>
<p>Instead, be direct and straightforward and hold your ground. These
schemers may treat you like a trusted insider, feeding you tidbits about
other people’s inadequacies and failures, as if only you have the
perspective and discretion to understand what’s important. Don’t be
taken in by the implied flattery. Ask for details and specifics to flush
out their intent: “I’m not sure I understand what you mean. Why are you
telling me this? What is it you’re asking me to do?”</p>
<p>In another client company, I worked with a leader who was
uncomfortable with direct conflict and who tried to get other
people—including me—to convey messages that she was afraid to deliver.
Rather than letting her hide her criticisms behind others, I would say
things like, “You’ve been clear that you don’t like how James handled
his team’s conflict. I’ll be happy to meet with you and James so that
you can explain your concern, and then I can work with him on managing
his team.” Now that she understands her own behavior pattern and has
received support to change, she’s far less likely to offload
uncomfortable situations to others.</p>
<p>If your position is senior to the manipulator’s, the most effective
thing is to begin a rigorous plan of corrective action promptly, using
approaches such as these and providing concrete behavioral feedback
until either they drop their inappropriate habits or you remove them.
And if you hold less power or influence, these three approaches will
help you protect yourself and minimize their negative impact both on you
and on the rest of the organization, for as long as you’re willing to
stay in the game.</p>
