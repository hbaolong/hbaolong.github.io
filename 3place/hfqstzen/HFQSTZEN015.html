<p>How Great Leaders Rebound After Career Disasters</p>
<p>By Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld and Andrew J. Ward</p>
<p>Among the tests of a leader, few are more challenging—and more
painful—than recovering from a career catastrophe, whether it is caused
by natural disaster, illness, misconduct, slip ups, or unjust
conspiratorial overthrow. But real leaders don’t cave in. Defeat
energizes them to rejoin the fray with greater determination and
vigor.</p>
<p>Take the case of Jamie Dimon, who was fired as president of Citigroup
but now is CEO of JP Morgan Chase. Or look at Vanguard founder Jack
Bogle, who was removed from his position as president of Wellington
Management but then went on to create the index fund and become a
leading voice for governance reform. Similarly, there’s former Coca-Cola
president Steve Heyer, who was surprisingly passed over for the CEO
position at Coke but then was quickly named head of Starwood Hotels.
Most colorful, perhaps, is Donald Trump, who recovered from two rounds
of financial distress in his casino business and is admired today both
as a hugely successful estate developer and as a producer and star of
popular reality TV shows—and of course ran successfully for President of
the United States.</p>
<p>These stories are still the exception rather than the rule. F. Scott
Fitzgerald’s famous observation that there are no second acts in
American lives casts an especially dark shadow over the derailed careers
of business leaders. In our research—analyzing more than 450 CEO
successions between 1988 and 1992 at large, publicly traded companies—we
found that only 35% of ousted CEOs returned to an active executive role
within two years of departure; 22% stepped back and took only advisory
roles, generally counseling smaller organizations or sitting on boards.
But 43% effectively ended their careers and went into retirement.</p>
<p>What prevents a deposed leader from coming back? Leaders who cannot
recover have a tendency to blame themselves and are often tempted to
dwell on the past rather than look to the future. They secretly hold
themselves responsible for their career setback, whether they were or
not, and get caught in a psychological web of their own making, unable
to move beyond the position they no longer hold. This dynamic is usually
reinforced by well-meaning colleagues and even by family and friends,
who may try to lay blame in an attempt to make sense of the chaos
surrounding the disaster. Sadly, their advice can often be more damaging
than helpful.</p>
<p>In every culture, the ability to transcend life’s adversity is an
essential feature of becoming a great leader. In his influential 1949
book, The Hero with a Thousand Faces, anthropologist Joseph Campbell
showed us that the various stories of great leaders around the world, in
every culture and every era, are all essentially the same story—the
“hero myth.” This myth is embodied in the life stages of such universal
archetypes as Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Aeneas, Odysseus, and the
Aztecs’ Tezcatlipoca. Transformational leaders follow a path that
entails a call to greatness, early successes (involving tough choices),
ongoing trials, profound setbacks, and, ultimately, triumph as they
reintegrate into society. If Campbell were writing today, he might want
to include business leaders in his study, as they must confront similar
trials on their way to greatness.</p>
<p>This article is intended to help leaders—or anyone suffering from an
unexpected setback—examine their often abrupt fall from grace and to
give them a process through which they can recover, and even exceed
their past accomplishments. From our 22 years of interviews with 300
fired CEOs and other derailed professionals, our scholarly study of
leadership, our consulting assignments, and our own searing personal
experiences, we are convinced that leaders can triumph over tragedy,
provided they take conscious steps to do so. For a start, they must
carefully decide how to fight back. Once this crucial decision has been
taken, they must recruit others into battle. They must then take steps
to recover their heroic status, in the process proving to themselves and
others that they have the mettle necessary to rediscover their heroic
mission.</p>
<p>Few people exemplify this journey better than President Jimmy Carter.
After his devastating 1980 reelection loss to Ronald Reagan, Carter was
emotionally fatigued. As he told us sometime later, “I returned to
Plains, Georgia, completely exhausted, slept for almost 24 hours, and
then awoke to an altogether new, unwanted, and potentially empty life.”
While proud of his achievements—his success in deregulating energy, for
example, his efforts to promote global human rights, and his ability to
broker peace between Israel and Egypt through the Camp David
Accords—post election, Carter needed to move past his sense of
frustration and rejection, particularly his failure to secure the timely
release of the American hostages in Iran.</p>
<p>Despite his pain and humiliation, Carter did not retreat into anger
or self-pity. He realized that his global prominence gave him a forum to
fight to restore his influential role in world events. Accordingly, he
recruited others into battle by enlisting the enthusiastic support of
his wife, Rosalynn, several members of his administration, academic
researchers in the sciences and social sciences, world leaders, and
financial backers to build the Carter Center. He proved his mettle by
refusing to remove himself from the fray. Indeed, he continued to
involve himself in international conflict mediation in Ethiopia and
Eritrea, Liberia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Venezuela, demonstrating in the
process that he was not a has-been. He regained his heroic stature when
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 “for his decades of
untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts,
to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and
social development.” And he has rediscovered his heroic mission by using
the Carter Center to continue his drive to advance human rights and
alleviate needless suffering.</p>
<p>Let us look now at how some great business leaders have followed the
same path to recover from their own disastrous career setbacks.</p>
<p>Decide how to fight back</p>
<p>The first decision you will face in responding to a career disaster
is the question of whether to confront the situation that brought you
down—with an exhausting, expensive, and perhaps embarrassing battle—or
to try to put it behind you as quickly as possible, in the hope that no
one will notice or remember for long. In some cases, it’s best to avoid
direct and immediate confrontation. Home Depot cofounder Bernie Marcus,
for example, decided to sidestep the quicksand of litigation against
Sandy Sigoloff, the conglomerateur who fired Marcus from Handy Dan Home
Improvement. Marcus made his battleground the marketplace rather than
the courtroom. Thanks to this strategy, he was free to set the historic
course for the Home Depot, which now under his successor is approaching
00 billion in sales, with several hundred thousand employees.</p>
<p>Other comeback kids also began with a graceful retreat. Jamie Dimon
was sacked as president of Citigroup by then chairman Sandy Weill
following 16 years of partnership in building the institution. When he
spoke to us and to others, he did not dwell on his disappointment or
sense of injustice. Monica Langley in her 2003 book Tearing Down the
Walls describes what happened when Weill asked Dimon to resign. Dimon
was shocked but replied, “You’ve obviously thought this through, and
there’s nothing I can do.” As he scanned the already-prepared press
release, Dimon saw that the board agreed with Weill. The firm offered
Dimon a generous, nonrestrictive severance package, so a battle with
Weill seemed pointless. While he was unemployed, Dimon read biographies
of great national leaders who had truly suffered. He also took up
boxing—another way, perhaps, of dealing with the stress and pain. After
a year of this, Dimon decided he needed closure, so he invited Weill to
lunch at the Four Seasons to thank him. As Dimon recounts in Harvey
Mackay’s 2004 book, We Got Fired!: “I had mellowed by then. Sandy wasn’t
going to call me. . . . I knew I was ready to say thank you for what he
did for me. I also knew he and I should talk about what happened. I
wanted to get this event behind me so I could move on. Part of me said I
had spent sixteen years with him. Twelve or thirteen were pretty good.
You can’t just look at one side and not the other. I made my own
mistakes; I acknowledged I was partly to blame. Whether I was 40 percent
or 60 percent to blame really didn’t matter. I felt very good about my
meeting with him.” In this way, Dimon was able to turn his ouster into
an event that yielded both helpful perspective and reassuring
resolution. (See the sidebar “Getting Beyond Rage and Denial.”)</p>
<p>GETTING BEYOND RAGE AND DENIAL</p>
<p>One of the most important steps on the route to recovery is to
confront and acknowledge failure. This can be as simple as understanding
the Machiavellian politics of others. So as you set about rebuilding
your career, make sure you:</p>
<p>Remember that failure is a beginning, not an end. Comeback is always
possible.</p>
<p>Look to the future. Preemptive actions are often more effective than
reactive ones—even if they only take the form of standing back and
reflecting on what to do next.</p>
<p>Help people deal with your failure. Even close friends may avoid you
because they don’t know what to say or do. Let them know that you are
ready for assistance and what kind of aid would be most useful.</p>
<p>Know your narrative. Reputation building involves telling and
retelling your story to get your account of events out there and to
explain your downfall. Be consistent.</p>
<p>About six months after that lunch, in March 2000, Dimon became CEO of
Bank One, a huge Chicago bank that survived the merger of First Chicago
and the original Banc One. That year, Bank One posted a loss of 11
million. Three years later, under Dimon’s leadership, Bank One was
earning record profits of .5 billion, and its stock price had soared
85%. Adding to the sweetness of vindication, the following year Bank One
merged with JPMorgan Chase, an institution with which Weill had long
wanted Citigroup to merge. Dimon became CEO of the new company and is
now widely regarded as one of the most influential financial executives
in the world.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not always a good decision to sit on the sidelines
and presume that justice will prevail. The highly respected Nick
Nicholas, outmaneuvered as CEO of Time Warner by his skilled rival
Gerald Levin, never challenged his old firm. He went off to Vail to ski
at the time, awaiting a call back to service, soon becoming a very
successful investor in new businesses, a professor, and a board
director. But he never regained his role as the leader of a great public
enterprise. Other deposed CEOs, such as Ford’s Jacques Nasser,
Hewlett-Packard’s Carly Fiorina, IBM’s John Akers, United Air Lines’
Richard Ferris, and Apple’s John Sculley have similarly failed to return
to lead major public firms. They were considered brilliant leaders by
many and were never accused of plundering the shareholders’ wealth, like
some rogue CEOs of recent years. But they never fought back, and they
disappeared from the corner office.</p>
<p>The key determinant in the fight-or-flight question is the damage (or
potential damage) incurred to the leader’s reputation—the most important
resource of all leaders. While departed CEOs and other leaders may have
enough other resources and experience to rebound, it is their reputation
that will make the difference between successful career recovery and
failure.</p>
<p>Fights that will result only in a Pyrrhic victory are best avoided.
Battles of pure revenge can resemble Shakespearean tragedies, where all
parties lose. Hewlett-Packard board member Tom Perkins, for example, in
trying to defend his friend and fellow director George Keyworth from
allegations of leaking confidential board discussions, not only brought
down HP chairman Patricia Dunn but also caused his friend far greater
humiliation, forcing him off the board as well. A leader must consider
whether fighting the allegations will exacerbate the damage by making
the accusations more public.</p>
<p>When, however, the allegations are not only sufficient to cause a
catastrophic career setback but would also block a career comeback, then
leaders need to fight back. Consider former Israeli prime minister Ariel
Sharon. He was a triumphant commander on the Egyptian front in the Six
Day War of 1967. Fifteen years later, as minister of defense, Sharon
initiated an attack on the Palestine Liberation Organization in Lebanon.
Christian militias seized the opportunity to massacre hundreds of
Palestinians in acts of revenge against the PLO in the
Israeli-controlled Sabra and Shatila refugee camps.</p>
<p>In a February 21, 1983, cover story, Time magazine reported that
these massacres were the result of a plot between Sharon and the
militias to avenge the killing of Lebanon’s Christian president Bashir
Gemayel. Sharon sued Time in Israel and in New York in lengthy
litigation. In both places, juries found Time’s accusations to be false
and defamatory. The magazine settled and apologized. “It was a very long
and hard struggle and was worth it,” Sharon said publically at the time.
“I came here to prove that Time magazine lied: We were able to prove
that Time did lie.”</p>
<p>A ferocious warrior, Sharon took on this carefully calculated battle
for his reputation and executed it with focus and determination. He knew
that if he did not vigorously defend himself, no one else would be able
to help him. Sharon could not have regained his honor and returned to
public office if he had not challenged these false charges and then
moved on with his life.</p>
<p>Recruit others into battle</p>
<p>Whether you fight or tactically retreat for a while, it is essential
to engage others right from the start to join your battle to put your
career back on track. Friends and acquaintances play an instrumental
role in providing support and advice in the process of recovery. Those
who really care for you can help you gain perspective on the good and
bad choices you have made. You are also more likely to make yourself
vulnerable with those you trust. Without such vulnerability, you cannot
hope to achieve the candid, self-critical perspective you will need to
learn from your experience. Still, although family and friends can
provide invaluable personal support, they may be less effective when it
comes to practical career assistance. Research has shown that slight
acquaintances are actually more helpful than close friends in steering
you toward opportunities for new positions in other organizations.</p>
<p>In an acclaimed study, Stanford University’s Mark Granovetter
discovered that of those individuals who landed jobs through personal
contacts, only 16.7% found them through people they saw at least twice a
week; 55.6% found positions through acquaintances seen at least once a
year. But 27.8% of job candidates found work through distant
acquaintances, whom they saw less than once a year—old college friends,
former workmates, or people known through professional associations. In
other words, more job contacts will come to you through people you see
less than once a year than from people you see twice or more a week.
That’s because close friends share the same networks as you do, whereas
acquaintances are more likely to introduce you to new people and
contacts. Indeed, through the power of acquaintance networks, you can
reach almost anyone within a few steps. Thus, distant acquaintances that
don’t appear to have any connection to you may prove key to your
recovery when you are trying to get back on your feet.</p>
<p>But it’s not enough to have a wide network of acquaintances. The
quality of the connections, even the more distant ones, matters as well.
That was the case for Home Depot’s Bernie Marcus. Marcus was devastated
when he was fired as CEO of Handy Dan on what he felt were trumped-up
charges made by Sandy Sigoloff, the threatened boss of the parent
company, Daylin. “There was a lot of self-pity on my part,” Marcus told
us. “I was drowning in my sorrow, going several nights at a time without
sleeping. For the first time in my adult life, instead of building, I
was more concerned with surviving.”</p>
<p>Marcus, however, had an unexpected resource. Whether they were close
friends and colleagues with whom he worked or acquaintances he dealt
with on a casual basis, Marcus treated others with uncommon honesty,
respect, and trust. This consideration was reciprocated by people in his
network when he needed help; it was one of his less frequent
acquaintances, Rip Fleming at Security Pacific National Bank, who made
it possible for Marcus to launch Home Depot.</p>
<p>Marcus had raised million in seed money for the Home Depot venture,
but that was not enough to get his new company off the ground. He
applied to several banks for a line of credit but was turned down every
time. Eventually, he knocked at Fleming’s door at Security Pacific
National. Both Marcus and Fleming believed that the relationship between
banker and client should amount to more than just the business
transactions they conducted. Consequently, Fleming had become an adviser
to Marcus at Handy Dan. Despite these strong professional ties, though,
Fleming was initially reluctant to issue a line of credit until Marcus
flew out to Los Angeles and sold Fleming on the idea. In the end,
Security Pacific National provided a .5 million line of credit, which
enabled Home Depot to get up and running. Unbeknownst to Marcus, the
proposal was repeatedly turned down by the bank’s loan committee and was
approved only when Fleming marched into the president’s office with his
resignation letter in hand.</p>
<p>How you build relationships has a huge impact on your prospects for
career recovery. Marcus had a way of building relatively strong
relationships even in circumstances when most people would settle for
weak acquaintanceships. This capacity for affiliation is a litmus test
of a leader’s ability to bounce back. People who can create connections
are much more likely to engender the kind of help they need when fate
turns against them.</p>
<p>Recover your heroic status</p>
<p>It’s not enough for you to recruit others to advance your career. To
launch your comeback, you must actually do things to win back the
support of a wider audience. To manage this, you must regain what we
call your heroic status.</p>
<p>The great leader has a heroic persona that confers a larger-than-life
presence. You can achieve this status by developing a personal dream
that you offer as a public possession. If your dream is accepted, you
achieve renown. If for whatever reason your public vision is ultimately
discarded, you suffer the loss of both your private dream and your
public identity. After a career disaster, you can rebound only if you
are able to rebuild your heroic stature—that is, the public reputation
with which you were previously perceived. An intrinsic part of
recovering this heroic status involves getting your story out. This
calls for a public campaign to educate and inform.</p>
<p>When a CEO is fired, the true causes for the dismissal are often
deliberately hidden, as the board seeks to protect the reputation of the
firm and itself. The organization often engages in elaborate face-saving
activities to disguise the real nature of the exit. Euphemistically, the
press reports that the CEO resigned “for personal reasons” or “to spend
more time with family.” In our interviews with dismissed CEOs, we found
that their greatest frustration stemmed from not being able to rebuild
their heroic stature by telling their side of the story. We have
interviewed several people who had seven-figure separation agreements
that were contingent on their toeing the party line when they left.
That’s a problem when CEOs are publicly sacrificed even though they are
not guilty of the accusations that led to their ouster. In such cases,
CEOs’ inability to challenge and set the record straight can lead to
destructive speculation in the press, which can damage their reputations
so much that it becomes all but impossible to recover.</p>
<p>Popular wisdom holds that a deposed leader should sign the
nondisparagement agreement, accept the noncompete clause, take the
money, and run. Our strong belief is that such agreements are a mistake.
In the end, your cash will disappear, and you won’t be able to get your
story out. If you agree not to speak out, be prepared to be unemployed
for a number of years.</p>
<p>A lesser-known player in the Enron saga, Daniel Scotto, comes to
mind. Scotto was the financial analyst who headed up the research
department for the large global investment bank Paribas. Early on,
Scotto said that Enron was losing money in all its mainstream businesses
and that it was only through offshore finagling that the company was
creating the image of profitability. Paribas, which was underwriting a
large part of the debt, asked Scotto to recant. When he wouldn’t,
Paribas put him on an imposed medical leave for three weeks and then
fired him. He was forced to sign a nondisparagement agreement that hurt
his ability to get his story out. Scotto has been unemployed for five
years.</p>
<p>Martha Stewart is the best reminder that it doesn’t have to be that
way. As the most public example in recent times of a CEO who got her
story out, Stewart is a model for how to regain your heroic status. She
did it by carefully orchestrating a multitiered campaign to restore her
reputation.</p>
<p>The day after she was indicted for obstruction of justice in the
federal government’s insider-trading investigation of ImClone stock,
Stewart took out a full-page advertisement in USA Today and the New York
Times and launched a new website, marthatalks.com. In an open letter to
her public, Stewart clearly proclaimed her innocence and her intention
to clear her name. She understood intuitively that when a hero stumbles,
constituents have to reconcile two conflicting images of the person—the
larger-than-life presence the hero once commanded and the hero’s new
fallen state. In her letter, Stewart managed to eliminate the confusion
by making sure that people knew her side of the story. She openly denied
any charges of insider trading and hammered home the unreliability of
the three witnesses upon which the government based its case. Stewart
very proactively helped others continue to believe in her heroic
status.</p>
<p>Stewart’s open letter was supported by a statement on her website by
her attorneys, Robert G. Morvillo and John J. Tigue Jr., who challenged
the media to investigate why the government waited nearly a year and a
half to file the charges. “Is it because she is a woman who has
successfully competed in a man’s business world by virtue of her talent,
hard work, and demanding standards?” they asked.</p>
<p>With the aid of her attorneys, Stewart ingeniously—and
successfully—portrayed herself as a David struggling in a just and
valiant quest against the Goliath of government. Her fans, far from
abandoning a fallen star, rallied around her. The astounding strength of
this sentiment is measured in the stock price of Martha Stewart Living
Omnimedia. Even at the midpoint of Stewart’s prison sentence, the stock
had not merely rebounded—it was 50% higher than before anybody had heard
of ImClone and the ill-fated stock transaction. Upon her release from
prison, the share price neared an all-time high, ad revenue at her
magazines picked up, and she launched two national network TV shows. The
more Stewart got her story out, the more loyal her public became.</p>
<p>Stewart managed to provide a reassuring account of what really
happened in her case. But what if you can’t? What if you have truly
stumbled? If you cannot refute the facts of your dismissal because they
are so condemning, show authentic remorse. The public is often
enormously forgiving of genuine contrition and atonement.</p>
<p>Prove your mettle</p>
<p>Protecting your reputation by knowing how to fight unjust accusations
and bringing others on board are both essential precursors to
relaunching a career in the aftermath of catastrophe. Ultimately,
however, you will recover fully only when you take on that next role or
start a new organization. When you show that you can still perform at a
credible or superior level, others will begin to think of you as having
the mettle to triumph over your career calamity. (See the sidebar “How
to Come Back.”)</p>
<p>Showing mettle is not easy. Fallen leaders face many barriers on the
path to recovery, not least of which are doubts in their own ability to
get back to the top. As one fired CEO told us, “I’d never sit here and
say, ‘Geez, all I have to do is just replicate and do it again.’ The
chances of doing it again are pretty small.” Yet leaders who rebound are
unfailingly those who get over this doubt about their ability to do it
again. Even when forced from familiar arenas into totally new fields,
some leaders remain unafraid of trying new ventures. This capacity to
bounce back from adversity—to prove your inner strength once more by
overcoming your shattered confidence—is critical to earning lasting
greatness.</p>
<p>HOW TO COME BACK</p>
<p>Our interviews with some 300 derailed CEOs and other professionals,
as well as our scholarly leadership research, consulting assignments,
and personal experiences, have brought to light five key steps for
rebounding from career disaster. Anyone trying to recover from a
catastrophic setback can use these steps to match, or even exceed, their
past accomplishments.</p>
<p>Decide how to fight back. Pyrrhic victories will hurt you by calling
attention to the accusations leveled against you. But when your
reputation is unfairly damaged, you must take quick action.</p>
<p>Recruit others into battle. Friends and family can provide comfort
and, perhaps, some perspective in your hour of need. But acquaintances
may be more important in landing that next job.</p>
<p>Recover your heroic status. Deposed leaders are often advised to sign
nondisparagement agreements. Don’t do it. Engage instead in a
multitiered campaign to clear your reputation and restore your
stature.</p>
<p>Prove your mettle. After suffering career disaster, you will probably
have doubts about your ability to get back to the top. You must overcome
that insecurity and in the process find the courage to prove to
others—and yourself—that you have not lost your magic touch.</p>
<p>Rediscover your heroic mission. It is the single-minded pursuit of a
lasting legacy that sets great leaders apart. To recover from a
disastrous setback, find a new heroic mission that renews your passion
and creates new meaning in your life.</p>
<p>Take Mickey Drexler. When Gap founder Donald Fisher poached Drexler
away from Ann Taylor in 1983, the Gap was struggling to compete, since
it sold the same brands of clothing as everyone else and was caught in a
pricing game. Drexler expanded the retailer beyond the core Gap stores
to brand extension such as GapKids, babyGap, and GapBody, as well as
introducing other complementary brands, including Banana Republic and
Old Navy. Between the time he arrived in 1983 and 2000, Gap’s sales
increased from 80 million to 3.7 billion, and its stock rose
169-fold.</p>
<p>Then things began to go awry. Drexler was accused of having lost his
touch as a prescient merchant; suspicion arose in the minds of analysts
and in the media that the goods had become too trendy. Although some
people have suggested that the real problem was that Fisher’s brother
had built too many stores too close to one another, Drexler was blamed
for the slump, as same-store sales dropped every quarter for two years,
and the stock plummeted 75%. On May 21, 2002, Drexler presented the
upcoming season’s merchandise to the board, confident that he had a
great selling line for the fall. It wasn’t enough for the directors, and
the next morning Fisher fired him, believing that the company was now
too large for Drexler’s hands-on management style.</p>
<p>Drexler was by this time independently wealthy, but he was
nonetheless determined to prove that the failures of the previous two
years were not primarily his fault and did not reflect his abilities. He
knew that the only way to restore his belief in himself, as well as
other people’s confidence in him, was to return to a role in which he
could once again demonstrate his expertise. He turned down a
multimillion-dollar severance package from Gap because it contained a
noncompete clause. After he explored a few other avenues, opportunity
came knocking in the guise of struggling fashion retailer J.Crew.</p>
<p>With only about 200 stores, J.Crew was a small fraction of the Gap’s
size and consequently much more amenable to Drexler’s hands-on style,
giving him a greater opportunity to make an impact. Drexler invested 0
million of his own money to buy a 22% stake in the company from the
retailer’s private owner, the investment firm Texas Pacific. He took a
salary that was less than a tenth of what he had earned at his former
employer. “You’ve no idea how much it’s costing me to run this company,”
he joked in a New York magazine article shortly after taking over.</p>
<p>The results more than proved that Drexler still had the right stuff.
J.Crew rebounded from a 0 million operating loss in 2003 to an operating
profit of over 7 million in 2004. Same-store sales per square foot, one
of the key metrics in retailing, rose 18% from 38 to 00, while at his
old employer, sales per square foot dropped 3%. By the summer of 2006,
Drexler had increased both sales and profits by 20% and launched a
wildly embraced IPO to take J.Crew public. The media celebrated his
recovery and acknowledged his obvious talent.</p>
<p>For Drexler, as for others, the comeback required him to prove his
worth in a situation that was perceived to be enormously difficult.
Start-ups or turnarounds are common contexts in which fallen leaders can
recover grace. It is in these demanding situations that leaders find the
mettle to prove to themselves and to others that they have not lost
their magic touch and that no obstacle is too great to overcome in their
quest for return.</p>
<p>Rediscover your heroic mission</p>
<p>Most great leaders want to build a legacy that will last beyond their
lifetime. This does not mean having their names etched on an ivy-clad
university ediface but rather advancing society by building and leading
an organization. This is what we call the leader’s heroic mission.</p>
<p>Most of the leaders we have profiled in this article were deeply
engaged in building a lasting legacy even before they suffered their
career setbacks. It is the loss of this mission that really raises a
derailment to catastrophic proportions in the leader’s own mind, since
it puts at risk a lifetime of achievement. On the day Steve Jobs was
fired from Apple in 1985, for example, his friend Mike Murray was so
concerned about Jobs’s reaction that he went over to Jobs’s house and
sat with him for hours until Murray was convinced that Jobs would not
commit suicide.</p>
<p>Jobs did not wallow in despair for long. A week after his ouster from
Apple, he flew to Europe and, after a few days in Paris, headed for the
Tuscan hills of northern Italy, where he bought a bicycle and a sleeping
bag and camped out under the stars, contemplating what he would do next.
From Italy, he went to Sweden and then to Russia before returning home.
Once back in California, with his passion and ambition renewed, Jobs set
about re-creating himself as a force in the IT world. He went on to
found another computer company, NeXT, which Apple purchased in 1996 for
00 million, at which point Jobs returned to Apple and at the same time
became the driving force behind the hugely successful computer-graphics
studio Pixar. Once back at Apple, Jobs revived and reenergized the
company with breakthrough, high-design products, such as the iMac,
iBook, and iPod, and took the company into emerging businesses, such as
iTunes.</p>
<p>Like Martha Stewart, Steve Jobs was able to recapture his original
heroic mission. Other deposed leaders, however, must truly start again
because the door to their familiar field is firmly closed, and they must
seek new opportunities and create a totally new heroic mission.</p>
<p>That’s what Drexel Burnham Lambert financier Michael Milken, the
imaginative “king of the junk bonds,” had to do. Milken’s life was
almost the incarnation of the American dream. Born on the Fourth of
July, Milken had become a billionaire by his mid-forties and one of the
most influential financiers in the world. Then it all came tumbling
down. He was charged with a 98-count criminal indictment, and a massive
civil case was brought against him by the SEC for insider trading, stock
parking, price manipulation, racketeering, and defrauding customers,
among other crimes. He ended up pleading guilty to six relatively minor
counts. In November 1990, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison, agreed
to pay 00 million at the time, and ended up paying a further 2 million
over a probation violation. After serving 22 months, Milken was released
early for cooperating with other inquiries. But he was barred from the
securities industry for life.</p>
<p>A week later, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was told
he had 12 to 18 months to live. He immediately turned his maniacal zeal
into a new heroic mission to conquer this disease. Through aggressive
treatment and his own dietary research, he survived to build a huge
foundation supporting research to battle prostate cancer. He also
created an economic research institute that attracts the world’s top
scientific, political, religious, and business leaders. Milken still
argues that he was wrongly accused. Others may disagree, but few would
doubt that he has earned restitution. The public has come to accept that
he has paid for his crimes, and there has even been some reconsideration
of their actual severity.</p>
<p>It is the single-minded, passionate pursuit of a heroic mission that
sets leaders like Steve Jobs and Michael Milken and Jimmy Carter apart
from the general population, and it is what attracts and motivates
followers to join them. In the worst of cases, to have that life purpose
ripped from you and to be prohibited from its further pursuit can leave
an unbearable void and doubts as to your reason for being. Finding a new
mission to replace your lifelong purpose can be a great struggle, but
one that is necessary if you are to recover.</p>
<p>The tragedies and triumphant comebacks of the leaders we have
profiled in this article can seem remote, bordering on the mythological,
perhaps. But their stories point to important lessons about recovering
from career catastrophe. Stunning comeback is possible in all
industries, though the challenges vary according to the leadership norms
of each field’s culture. For example, clergy ensnarled in publicized sex
scandals will probably see their careers dissolve, whereas entertainment
figures may not only recover but actually benefit from notoriety. Where
one profession values trust, another values celebrity. Thus, recovery
plans must be adapted to the cultures of different industries.</p>
<p>Whatever the arena in which your recovery takes shape, the important
thing to remember is that we all have choices in life, even in defeat.
We can lose our health, our loved ones, our jobs, but much can be saved.
No one can truly define success and failure for us—only we can define
that for ourselves. No one can take away our dignity unless we surrender
it. No one can take away our hope and pride unless we relinquish them.
No one can steal our creativity, imagination, and skills unless we stop
thinking. No one can stop us from rebounding unless we give up.</p>
