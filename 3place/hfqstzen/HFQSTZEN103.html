Productivity Tips for People Who Hate Productivity Tips</h4>
<p>By Monique Valcour</p>
<p>Traditional approaches to staying focused don’t work for me.” “I know
what I should do to be more productive, but I just don’t do it.” I hear
sentences like these repeatedly from coaching clients. Many have read
articles and books—and have even been trained in productivity
methods—but still find staying focused to be an uphill battle. Why do
people who know a lot about what helps people focus still struggle to
focus? Through my work, I’ve identified several reasons, as well as
strategies that may help you gain control.</p>
<p>Assuming that others’ preferred productivity strategies should work
for you can yield frustration and a sense of defeat. A friend or an
author may advocate their own approach so enthusiastically that it seems
foolproof if properly implemented. But if you experience the approach as
inauthentic or constraining, it may not be right for you. Trying to make
it work can send you into a rut where you repeat unhelpful behaviors
while beating yourself up over your lack of focus.</p>
<p>For example, a subset of my coaching clients has an aversion to
structuring their time usage with widely recommended tools like
spreadsheets, planners, calendars, if-then rules, and timers. These are
often the same clients who are closely attuned to the quality of their
work experience, who find joy in flow and seek to create more of it, and
for whom the introduction of industrial productivity levers feels
stifling. If this describes you, you’ll benefit by paying attention to
what’s happening within yourself as you work and using what you observe
to inform your strategies.</p>
<p>If you feel defeated, two things will help you move forward and feel
more in control. The first is to accept where you are and have
compassion for yourself. When you admit to yourself, “I’m stuck. This
feels awful,” and let that admission sit in your awareness without
fighting it or using it to berate yourself, it loses its power to derail
you. Treat yourself with compassion by recognizing your strengths,
recalling challenges you’ve overcome in the past, and affirming your
capacity to solve problems.</p>
<p>Then move forward by experimenting and reflecting. I encourage my
clients to check in with how their work process feels at different
points throughout the day and make adjustments to improve the quality of
their work experience. Being flexible helps. If one approach isn’t
working, try another rather than continuing to hammer away fruitlessly.
Frustrated sitting at your desk? Take your work outside or to a coffee
shop for a couple of hours. Computer screen making your eyes go buggy?
Switch to working on paper or using voice recognition. Perhaps you’re
determined to complete something before lunch. But if frustration is
building, stepping away, taking a walk, and getting something to eat may
be exactly what you need to facilitate smooth and rapid completion of
the task after lunch.</p>
<p>Leveraging the connection between mind and body is key to knowing
when to make a change. For instance, I’ve learned that I need to get out
of my chair to stretch several times a day. Tightness in my shoulders or
numbness in my buttocks triggers the urge to move. If I feel myself
hunching or my jaw getting tight, I’ll walk to the window or go outside
and breathe for few minutes. I also build in exercise nearly every day,
typically toward the end of the workday or before something that doesn’t
require close attention as I find that it diffuses rather than sharpens
my focus. Your body can provide you with important cues to optimally
manage your focus.</p>
<p>Some people like to keep track of what they plan to accomplish by
when. On the other hand, focusing on the process of work rather than the
output is a powerfully facilitative perspective shift for many. For
instance, my client Nora learned that if she framed her main goal for
the day as “finish project,” she felt increasingly stressed as time went
by if the project wasn’t moving along as quickly as she’d hoped—and she
was ultimately demoralized at the end of the day if the project remained
incomplete. She found she’s much better served by an intention to “work
on project” or “make progress on project,” particularly when she
identifies discrete tasks and little milestones that can serve as
indicators of progress.</p>
<p>Staying focused doesn’t have to be a struggle. While it may not be
easy, managing your focus can and should be self-affirming and
fulfilling. Making progress on work that is meaningful is among the most
energizing and satisfying experiences anyone can have. Therefore, it
makes sense to engineer your workflow for ease and progress. University
of Minnesota professor Theresa Glomb recommends organizing your work for
a “downhill start.”1 Like parking your car on a slope facing downhill,
what can you do to set conditions such that you need only lift your foot
from the brake to get moving? Clear off your desk before you start a new
task? Write down your two top priorities for the next day before leaving
in the evening? Perhaps you’re a big-picture person who gets bogged down
in details. To move your big idea toward realization, you must pinch a
manageable task out of your vision and perform it. Ask yourself, “What’s
one tiny step I could take?” For example, if I get an idea for an
article I’d like to write, I know that the inspiration will dissipate if
I don’t convert it to action. I can do a rough outline in a few minutes
(tangible progress). If I have time, I’ll develop it into a more
extensive outline (more progress). Outlining is much faster and easier
than writing a whole draft, yet it’s a concrete step forward that feels
good and facilitates the next phase of writing. Waiting for inspiration
to create something big from scratch doesn’t work; in fact, it slams the
brakes on productivity. What does work is finding ways to take small
steps and enjoying the resulting sense of progress.</p>
<p>If someone else’s productivity strategy feels artificial to you, it
probably won’t motivate you. For instance, some people can increase
their productivity by setting a series of deadlines for themselves. For
others, a deadline only promotes focus when it’s real, interpersonally
relevant, and has serious consequences attached, not when it’s made up
by themselves or someone else for seemingly arbitrary reasons. A real
deadline for me is, for example, knowing there will be an audience
waiting to hear me speak at a particular time. With that kind of
deadline, I’ll be ready and I will deliver an excellent talk. By
contrast, me stating to myself or someone else that I plan to have my
slides done two weeks in advance won’t help me focus.</p>
<p>Productivity strategies also lose their potential to motivate when
they don’t feel meaningful. Try reframing something you have to do in
terms of your core values for stronger and more sustained focus. Let’s
say I need to schedule interviews with employees at a client firm.
Managing the emails and the scheduling process feels tedious if I
consider these tasks mindless administrative details. But when I think
of them as opening conversations that hold the key to helping people
grow and thrive, they become engaging.</p>
<p>Many people fall prey to distractions, both internal and external, in
their quest to focus. A useful tool to fend off distraction is an
inquiry into the costs of giving in to it. Surrendering to distraction,
while temporarily soothing, will later generate feelings of regret and
even incompetence. On the other hand, making progress boosts the
wonderfully self-affirming sense of mastery. In the face of temptation
to give in to distraction, ask yourself the following question: “What
are you saying no to right now?” When you take stock of the fact that
tumbling down an internet rabbit hole means letting go of the reins and
giving up time for the things you really want to do, you may well find
the strength to focus.</p>
<p>Finally, accept that focus is dynamic, a work in progress. There’s no
single tool that will help you develop laser-like focus that never
wanders. The best response to a few hours given over to distraction is
not self-recrimination but self-compassion paired with curiosity.
Regardless of whether your focus has been ideal or not, take a few
moments at the end of each day to note what you accomplished and to set
yourself up for a smooth downhill start on the next day’s targets for
progress.</p>
