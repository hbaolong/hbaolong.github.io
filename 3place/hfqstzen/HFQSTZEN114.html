<h4 id="you-by-the-numbers">7 You, By the Numbers</h4>
<p>By H. James Wilson</p>
<p>Afew years ago entrepreneur and scientist Stephen Wolfram wrote a
blog post titled “The Personal Analytics of My Life.”1 In it, he mapped
data about his email usage, time spent in meetings, even the number of
keystrokes he’s logged—for 22 years. The resulting charts and graphs are
mesmerizing, and somewhat instructive. Wolfram has documented that he’s
a man of routine who likes to work alone late at night. He knows that
although his scheduled telephone calls usually start on time, his
in-person meetings are less predictable—and that he’s hitting the
backspace key 7% of the time he’s on the keyboard.</p>
<p>This “effort at self-awareness,” as Wolfram described it, makes him a
trailblazer in the growing discipline of auto-analytics—the practice of
voluntarily collecting and analyzing data about oneself in order to
improve. Athletes have long used visual and advanced statistical
analysis to ratchet up their performance. Now auto-analytics is
flourishing in the workplace, too. With wearables, mobile devices and
apps, sophisticated data visualization, and AI, it has become fairly
easy to monitor our office activity—and any factors that might affect
it—and to use that information to make better choices about where to
focus our time and energy.</p>
<p>This heralds an important shift in how we think about tracking work
performance and even career planning. Employees have long been measured,
but managers have traditionally chosen the tools and the metrics—and,
more important, decided how to interpret the findings. With
auto-analytics, individuals take control. They can run autonomous
experiments to pinpoint which tasks and techniques make them most
productive and satisfied—and then implement changes accordingly.</p>
<p>Wolfram’s insight was that his “shockingly regular” routine liberated
him to be “energetic—and spontaneous—about intellectual and other
things.” But he did not use the data to discover ways to improve his
performance, and in that way his blog post is as much cautionary as it
is pioneering, for it highlights the pitfalls of embracing
auto-analytics without first adopting a plan. Lacking a clear goal at
the outset, Wolfram took two decades to synthesize his vast collection
of data. Even then he stopped at observation rather than progressing to
analysis and intervention. What improvements could he have made on the
basis of his findings? Would it have been more useful to map, say,
project time lines against stress levels—or, given that he runs his
company remotely, moods against time spent with others?</p>
<p>If these kinds of questions are not tackled up front, auto-analytics
runs the risk of becoming a promising concept that’s poorly applied and
then dismissed as just another tech fad. To do it right, you need to
understand the tools and develop an approach. The aim is not merely to
increase self-awareness but to become better at your job and more
satisfied with your life.</p>
<p>The tools</p>
<p>There are two broad types of auto-analytics tools. The first are
trackers, which reveal patterns and help you set goals. They allow you
to document routines and physical responses such as sleep hours, heart
rate, and food consumed or calories burned—information you can use to
learn, for example, how your caffeine and sugar consumption affects your
work output or which office interactions spike your blood pressure.
Trackers are best used longitudinally (over days, weeks, or longer) and
iteratively, to test interventions and their results until the right
balance is struck. You gather a baseline of personal data and then run
cycles of data collection and analysis.</p>
<p>That analysis readies you for the second type of tools, nudgers,
which guide you toward your goals by asking questions or prompting
action on the basis of the data they’ve received. Nudgers are often apps
or online tools that might tell you to work out, to stop drinking
coffee, or to slow down during a presentation. They usually require some
up-front investment to make the algorithms “know” how and when to ping
you.</p>
<p>The analysis</p>
<p>What exactly can you measure? Using successful cases and research, I
have developed a framework that includes three arenas where
auto-analytics can be useful: the physical self, the thinking self, and
the emotional self (body, mind, and spirit).</p>
<p>The physical self</p>
<p>Your physical condition affects your work. We’ve known this roughly
since the Industrial Revolution, when Frederick Taylor’s famous time and
motion studies showed that an iron-plant worker’s movements, such as
shoveling pig iron into a cart, could be measured and improved.
Likewise, the sleep patterns, stress levels, and exercise regimens of
knowledge workers have been shown to affect productivity, creativity,
and overall job performance. Today these workers can choose from a
variety of mobile apps, wearable sensors, or desktop tools that
autonomously collect rich data about their bodies’ movements and
physiological systems.</p>
<p>Business consultant Sacha Chua wanted to understand the relationship
between her sleep schedule and achieving her professional priorities, so
she has tested several tools for this purpose. Using a sleep-tracking
app, she monitored her bedtimes, wake-up times, amount of sleep per
night, and sleep quality over several weeks. (See the sidebar
“Self-Measurement at a Glance.”) With this baseline and a hypothesis
that she was sleeping later than she should, she then tried waking up
earlier—at 5:40 rather than 8:30 a.m.</p>
<p>SELF-MEASUREMENT AT A GLANCE</p>
<p>Tools in the field of auto-analytics often employ behavior-based
algorithms to make recommendations to users. The analyzed data may be
collected by wearable devices with sensors and visualized on mobile
devices or computers. Most tools focus on one of three personal
domains.</p>
<p>The physical self</p>
<p>Tools that measure and monitor physical movements and body functions
help you make better decisions about professional effectiveness and
well-being. Sleep trackers may gather data on sleep quantity and
quality, enabling you to understand why you feel alert (or lethargic) on
certain workdays and how to optimize the relationship between rest and
performance. Movement or fitness trackers may count the number of steps
you’ve taken or nudge you to get up when you’ve been sitting still for
too long.</p>
<p>The thinking self</p>
<p>Tools focused on the thinking self gather data related to the
routines, habits, and productivity of knowledge work. Browser-based
attention trackers visualize patterns that reflect where and how much
your attention flows across categories while on the web during a
workday.</p>
<p>The emotional self</p>
<p>Tools that measure emotions increase users’ awareness of how
professional decisions, situations, and actions correlate with mood. A
mood-tracking app may prompt you with occasional simple questions to
track your state of mind over time. Then it can make recommendations,
derived from clinical practice insights and research data, about how you
can improve job performance and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Chua discovered, to her surprise, that she was getting more and
better sleep with the new wake-up time, which improved her engagement
and performance at work. It seemed to be forcing her to eschew
unimportant late-night activities, such as browsing the web, so that she
could go to bed earlier. Instead of squandering much of her morning in
low-quality sleep while hitting the snooze button over and over, she
could spend the time writing and programming. This exercise was
nominally about sleep, but the data provided a more rigorous way for
Chua to explore, prioritize, and act on what really mattered to her
personally and professionally.</p>
<p>The thinking self</p>
<p>In the 1960s Peter Drucker legitimized quantifying the thinking self
into units of knowledge work. Although knowledge work has remained
notoriously tough to measure rigorously or directly while it is being
performed, its output is still tracked with approximations like billable
hours, reports filed, or lines of code written. Such measures can inform
managers and financial systems, but they do little to guide individuals
who want to learn how to get better at their jobs. Auto-analytics can
help by gathering data as you perform cognitive tasks, such as client
research on your smartphone or statistical analysis in Excel.</p>
<p>Google engineer Bob Evans used both trackers and nudgers to
investigate the relationship between his attention and his productivity.
He explains, “As engineers, we load up our heads with all these
variables, the intellectual pieces of the systems we are building. If we
get distracted, we lose that thread in our heads.”</p>
<p>With a tool that interacts with online calendars, Evans analyzed how
frequently he was shifting between solitary thinking and collegial
interaction across his days and weeks—and then mapped that against his
work output. The data showed him that he needs about four straight hours
to get anything ambitious done, so he’s now focusing on his most
challenging tasks when he has that kind of time, not during days when
lots of meetings disrupt his mental flow.</p>
<p>Evans also uses a mobile app that randomly pings him three times a
day, asking, “Have you been working in the past two hours?” If he
hasn’t, he’s prodded to refocus. If he clicks yes, the app asks more
questions: “What was your primary work activity?” and “What was your
secondary work activity?” This data-gathering approach, developed by
psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, is called the experience sampling
method, or ESM. Just over a week into Evans’s three-week experiment, the
ESM data began to show that he was responding to work emails too
frequently, which distracted him from more important tasks. So he began
to answer email just twice a day to see whether that increased his
productivity. It did. In the third week, every time the app pinged him,
he was in the midst of his core programming work. (Notably, one of
Evans’s colleagues set the app to check in with him eight times a day.
He grew so frustrated that he abandoned the experiment.)</p>
<p>The emotional self</p>
<p>Daniel Goleman famously asserted that nearly 90% of the difference
between outstanding and average leaders is attributable to emotional
factors, not intellectual acumen. Indeed, many professionals are
intrigued by the role emotions play in their careers, and they aspire to
become more aware of their own emotional states and their ability to
manage them. Yet assessment tools and coaches focusing on emotional
intelligence are expensive, intrusive, and often reserved for select
members of the C-suite.</p>
<p>Auto-analytics tools don’t measure emotional intelligence per se, but
they provide an easier way to gain insight into emotions and use data to
enhance our predictions of what will make us happy in our daily work and
careers. Many apps and tools track moods by prompting the user: “How do
you feel right now?” If you use one on a GPS-enabled mobile phone, you
can discover correlations between your emotions and your location. Are
you happiest working at home, at Starbucks, or at the office? Are you
less happy at certain client sites or when you travel? Or, using a tool
that crunches textual data—such as the types of words in your email
communications or journal entries—you can quantify feelings about a
particular assignment or job opportunity.</p>
<p>These tools are no substitute for personal reflection, but they can
facilitate the process. A case in point is that of Marie Dupuch, a
branding strategist who had long envied people who “could recognize
their mood and know exactly what put them in it.” Realizing she wasn’t
that intuitive, she instead tried a quantitative approach to
understanding her emotions.</p>
<p>With college graduation looming, and the pressure to “reflect and
figure things out” before entering the job market, she began tracking
her moods. During her three-month final semester, she used a beta
version of a tracker app that asked her to rate her mood on a five-point
scale three times a day. At first, the findings were predictable:
Talking to friends and family on Skype enhanced her mood; riding on
public transportation depressed it. But one data point stood out:
Thursdays were her happiest days, which surprised her given that they
were also her busiest.</p>
<p>On Thursdays Dupuch drove from her college campus to the city for a
course on advertising that featured guest lecturers and required
interaction with advertising executives and other creative types. She
hypothesized that it was the exposure to the advertising world in an
urban location that made her hardest day her happiest. So she decided to
test her theory: She scheduled six informational interviews over five
days with ad agencies in Manhattan and measured her mood the whole time.
She reflects, “Through this test I was able to see with real data that
advertising was a good bet, that this was the kind of career that would
make me happy.” Today she is working happily and productively in the
advertising industry in New York.</p>
<p>Of course, effectively tracking your emotions presupposes that you
can take an analytical—even a clinical—view of your mood when data are
being gathered. That’s quite different from tracking hours of sleep or
number of emails sent. Dupuch is among many I’ve spoken to who say that
the process is unnatural at first but that it gets easier with practice
and eventually improves your ability to sense and react to how you’re
feeling.</p>
<p>The future</p>
<p>It’s still early days for auto-analytics. Nevertheless, important new
streams of research, based in cognitive and behavioral science, are
currently being conducted at universities and by private enterprises. A
project called Quantified Self is hosting opportunities for individuals
to try out auto-analytics tools and experimental methods. In addition,
new field-based insights on data visualization and algorithm innovation
from the field of business analytics have direct application for
auto-analytics practitioners and toolmakers.</p>
<p>Two other trends are also emerging. First, the tools will become more
sophisticated. Some will be smarter, with machine-learning algorithms
that make the nudging function more nuanced so that, for example, the
technology knows better when and how to ping you. They may also allow
for more accuracy, gathering more types of data related to diet and
physical activity at a faster rate. Some tools will become less
visible—woven into clothing to capture physical data, for instance, or
embedded in professional tools such as spreadsheets and word processing
apps. Second, a more holistic approach to auto-analytics will develop.
Applications will consolidate many kinds of measurements in a single
dashboard and allow us to analyze ourselves across ever more complex
dimensions.</p>
<p>Some tools already combine tracking and nudging—and can add a social
dimension. They ask you to create a goal, such as increasing your number
of sales calls or conversations with direct reports each week, and then
use digital displays to help you analyze your daily progress toward
achieving it. To increase your motivation, they use nudges or even levy
small financial penalties when you veer off track. And they can be used
socially so that people—even strangers—working toward the same goal can
share data and encourage one another, as people do in a weight-loss
club.</p>
<p>Tech entrepreneur Nick Winter has used this methodology to great
success. When he felt he was on a productivity plateau and sensed that
his new business was in jeopardy, he began gathering data on his work
activities and output. Over a 10-month period, Winter tested four
distinct approaches to being more productive, from spreadsheet tracking
to nudger tools. He settled on an auto-analytics technique called
“percentile feedback graphing” to help him see trends clearly. He has
now assembled an online group of like-minded colleagues who compare—and
compete on—their metrics.</p>
<p>Another example of data consolidation is Personal Analytics Companion
(PACO), an open-source mobile app designed by Google’s Bob Evans, whose
story appeared earlier. “Instead of having all these vertical apps, from
mood trackers to meeting trackers, this is one place where you . . . can
mash all your data together and compare,” Evans says. “You can see
trends, distributions, relationships.”</p>
<p>Imagine the auto-analytics app that helps a manager reschedule his
innovation session because it knows he didn’t sleep well, his extra-long
commute created stress, and he has a dull budget meeting right before
the session. Or consider the knowledge worker who arms herself before a
performance review with personal benchmark data that will support or
counter her manager’s assessment.</p>
<p>That’s where auto-analytics is heading. When analysis reveals higher
performance on noncore tasks, auto-analytics can even become the impetus
for a full-on career switch. Think of how much less anxiety that
life-altering decision would cause if you had data to support it.</p>
<p>Applied the right way, auto-analytics can provide hard evidence in
situations where traditionally we’ve relied on intuition and anecdotal
feedback. Quantifying yourself is a revelatory experience—and perhaps
the best thing you can do to improve your career and your life.</p>
