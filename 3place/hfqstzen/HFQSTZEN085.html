<h4 id="why-do-so-many-incompetent-men-become-leaders">13 Why Do So Many
Incompetent Men Become Leaders?</h4>
<p>By Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</p>
<p>There are three popular explanations for the clear
underrepresentation of women in management: They are not capable; they
are not interested; or they are both interested and capable, but they
are unable to break the glass ceiling, an invisible career barrier based
on prejudiced stereotypes that prevents women from accessing the ranks
of power. Conservatives and chauvinists tend to endorse the first;
liberals and feminists prefer the third; and those somewhere in the
middle are usually drawn to the second. But what if they have all missed
the big picture?</p>
<p>In my view, the main reason for the unbalanced gender ratio in
management is our inability to discern between confidence and
competence. That is, because we (people in general) commonly
misinterpret displays of confidence as a sign of competence, we are
fooled into believing that men are better leaders than women. In other
words, when it comes to leadership, the only advantage that men have
over women (from Argentina to Norway and the USA to Japan) is the fact
that manifestations of hubris—often masked as charisma or charm—are
commonly mistaken for leadership potential and that these occur much
more frequently in men than in women.1</p>
<p>This is consistent with the finding that leaderless groups have a
natural tendency to elect self-centered, overconfident, and narcissistic
individuals as leaders and that these personality characteristics are
not equally common in men and women.2 In line with this, Freud argued
that the psychological process of leadership occurs because a group of
people—the followers—have replaced their own narcissistic tendencies
with those of the leader, such that their love for the leader is a
disguised form of self-love or a substitute for their inability to love
themselves. “Another person’s narcissism,” he said, “has a great
attraction for those who have renounced part of their own . . . as if we
envied them for maintaining a blissful state of mind.”</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is that pretty much anywhere in the world,
men tend to think that they are much smarter than women.3 Yet arrogance
and over-confidence are inversely related to leadership talent—the
ability to build and maintain high- performing teams and to inspire
followers to set aside their selfish agendas in order to work for the
common interest of the group. Indeed, whether in sports, politics, or
business, the best leaders are usually humble—and whether through nature
or nurture, humility is a much more common feature in women than men.
For example, women outperform men on emotional intelligence, which is a
strong driver of modest behaviors.4 Furthermore, a quantitative review
of gender differences in personality involving more than 23,000
participants in 26 cultures indicated that women are more sensitive,
considerate, and humble than men, which is arguably one of the least
counterintuitive findings in the social sciences.5 An even clearer
picture emerges when one examines the dark side of personality: For
instance, our normative data, which includes thousands of managers from
across all industry sectors and 40 countries, shows that men are
consistently more arrogant, manipulative, and risk-prone than
women.6</p>
<p>The paradoxical implication is that the same psychological
characteristics that enable male managers to rise to the top of the
corporate or political ladder are actually responsible for their
downfall. In other words, what it takes to get the job is not just
different from, but also the reverse of, what it takes to do the job
well. As a result, too many incompetent people are promoted to
management jobs, and promoted over more competent people.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the mythical image of a “leader” embodies many of the
characteristics commonly found in personality disorders, such as
narcissism (Steve Jobs or Vladimir Putin), psychopathy (fill in the name
of your favorite despot here), histrionic tendencies (Richard Branson or
Steve Ballmer), or a Machiavellian personality (nearly any federal-level
politician). The sad thing is not that these mythical figures are
unrepresentative of the average manager, but that the average manager
will fail precisely for having these characteristics.</p>
<p>In fact, most leaders—whether in politics or business—fail. That has
always been the case: The majority of nations, companies, societies, and
organizations are poorly managed, as indicated by their longevity,
revenues, and approval ratings, or by the effects they have on their
citizens, employees, subordinates, or members. Good leadership has
always been the exception, not the norm.</p>
<p>So it struck me as a little odd that so much of the recent debate
over getting women to “lean in” has focused on getting them to adopt
more of these dysfunctional leadership traits. Yes, these are the people
we often choose as our leaders—but should they be?</p>
<p>Most of the character traits that are truly advantageous for
effective leadership are predominantly found in those who fail to
impress others with their talent for management. This is especially true
for women. There is now compelling scientific evidence supporting the
notion that women are more likely to adopt more-effective leadership
strategies than are men. Most notably, in a comprehensive review of
studies, Alice Eagly and colleagues showed that female managers are more
likely to elicit respect and pride from their followers, communicate
their vision effectively, empower and mentor subordinates, and approach
problem solving in a more flexible and creative way (all characteristics
of “transformational leadership”), as well as fairly reward direct
reports.7 In contrast, male managers are statistically less likely to
bond or connect with their subordinates, and they are relatively less
adept at rewarding them for their actual performance. Although these
findings may reflect a sampling bias that requires women to be more
qualified and competent than men in order to be chosen as leaders, there
is no way of really knowing until this bias is eliminated.</p>
<p>In sum, there is no denying that women’s path to leadership positions
is paved with many barriers, including a very thick glass ceiling. But a
much bigger problem is the lack of career obstacles for incompetent men,
and the fact that we tend to equate leadership with the very
psychological features that make the average man a more inept leader
than the average woman.8 The result is a pathological system that
rewards men for their incompetence while punishing women for their
competence, to everybody’s detriment.</p>
