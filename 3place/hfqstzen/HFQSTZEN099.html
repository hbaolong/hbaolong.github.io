Break the Cycle of Stress and Distraction by Using Your Emotional
Intelligence</h4>
<p>By Kandi Wiens</p>
<p>Being able to focus helps us succeed.1 Whether it’s focusing inward
and attuning ourselves to our intuitions and values or outward and
navigating the world around us, honing our attention is a valuable
asset.</p>
<p>All too often though, our focus and attention get hijacked, leaving
us feeling frazzled, forgetful, and unable to concentrate. In my
coaching work with executives, these are the kinds of statements I most
often hear when they’ve lost their focus (I may have uttered a few of
them myself):</p>
<p>“I feel completely overwhelmed.”</p>
<p>“My workload is insane, and there’s never enough time to get things
done when I’m in meetings and dealing with urgent issues all day
long.”</p>
<p>“I’m mentally exhausted from the pressure and constant distractions
in my office. I just can’t seem to focus.”</p>
<p>Constant distractions and a lack of time certainly interrupt our
focus, but stress also plays a major role.2</p>
<p>Chronic stress floods our nervous system with cortisol and adrenaline
that short-circuits important cognitive functions.3 Researchers have
studied the negative effects of stress on focus, memory, and other
cognitive functions for decades. The findings are consistent: Short-term
stress raises cortisol levels (the so-called stress hormone) for short
periods and can jump-start our adrenaline and motivate us to perform
more efficiently in response to impending deadlines.4 Long-term stress,
however, can lead to prolonged increases in cortisol and can be toxic to
the brain. Scientists also suspect that high levels of cortisol over a
long period of time are a key contributor to Alzheimer’s and other forms
of dementia.5</p>
<p>When we can’t focus at work because of distractions, it may lead us
to feel stressed about not being productive, which then causes us to
focus less, further feeding the cycle. Unfortunately, most of us don’t
notice our focus declining until we become completely overwhelmed. When
mental and emotional exhaustion sets in, it further drains our ability
to focus, concentrate, and recall information.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are things we can do to break the cycle. I’ve
found in my research that one of the reasons why some people get burned
out and others don’t is because they use their emotional intelligence
(EI) to manage their stress.6 You can use these same competencies, in
particular self-awareness and self-management, to improve your focus.
Here’s how.</p>
<p>Start by using your self-awareness to help you notice several
things:</p>
<p>Why you feel stressed or anxious. Before you can deal with stress,
you need to know what’s causing it. As simple as it may sound, it can be
helpful to make a list of the sources of your stress. Write down each
thing in your life and at work that’s causing you anxiety. You might
categorize items into things you have the ability to change and things
you don’t. For the stressors in the latter category, you will need to
figure out how to change your attitude toward them.7</p>
<p>How you lose your ability to focus. According to clinical
psychologist Michael Lipson, you can learn to sharpen your focus by
understanding how exactly your concentration strays in the first place.8
By paying attention to the patterns that lead to your lack of focus, you
can begin to develop your ability to dismiss distractions and stay with
your original point of attention.</p>
<p>How you feel when you can’t focus. Does it make you anxious when you
can’t recall information when you need it—perhaps during a job
interview, a high-stakes presentation, or an important client meeting?
Do you feel tense and dazed when you’re racking your brain trying to
find just the right words for an important email? These can be clues
that you’re more stressed than you may realize—and that your inability
to concentrate is causing even more stress.</p>
<p>When you lose your ability to focus. If, for exam ple, you find
yourself worrying yourself sick over something while you’re driving 65
mph on the highway with a car full of kids, you’re putting yourself and
others in real danger. This can be a wake-up call to bring your
attention back to what you’re doing and make a decision to think about
your concerns later.</p>
<p>Once you’ve increased your awareness of what’s causing you stress and
how and when you lose your focus, you can use the following strategies,
which depend on your self-management abilities, to make better choices
that keep you focused.</p>
<p>Do a digital detox.9 In its 2017 Stress in America survey, The
American Psychological Association (APA) found that “constant
checkers”—people who check their emails, texts, and social media on a
constant basis—experience more stress than those who don’t.10 More than
42% of respondents attribute their stress to political and cultural
discussions on social media, compared with 33% of non-constant checkers.
While it may feel impossible to take a cold turkey break from
technology, the APA says that periodically unplugging or limiting your
digital access can be great for your mental health.</p>
<p>Rest your brain. Most of us have experienced sleepless nights caused
by ruminating over past events or fears and anxieties about the future.
When you add a few of these nights together, sleep deprivation can set
in, making it more difficult to focus and more challenging to receive
and recall information.11 Our interpretation of events and our judgment
may be affected, too.12 Lack of sleep can negatively affect our
decisions because it impairs our ability to accurately assess a
situation, plan accordingly, and behave appropriately. Committing to the
recommended seven to eight hours of sleep each night may seem impossible
when you’re stressed and overworked, but the payoff is worth it.13</p>
<p>Practice mindfulness. The research on mindfulness is clear and
compelling. Having a mindfulness practice decreases our tendency to jump
to conclusions and have knee-jerk reactions we may regret later (and
potentially cause more stress).14 Neuroscientist Richard Davidson says
that “Mindfulness boosts the classic attention network in the brain’s
frontoparietal system that works together to allocate attention.”15 In
other words, mindfulness is key to emotional resilience, which is a key
contributor in our ability to quickly recover from stress. Don’t worry,
you don’t have to be a serious yogi to practice mindfulness.16</p>
<p>Shift your focus to others. When we fixate on our own worries and
fears, it can take our attention away from those we care about. Studies
(mine included) show that shifting our focus to others produces
physiological effects that calm us and strengthen our resilience.17 If
you pay more attention to other people’s feelings and needs and show
concern for them, you can not only take your mind off of your stress but
also reap the benefits of knowing that you’re doing something meaningful
for someone you care about.18</p>
<p>Too many people feel like they need to work harder when they struggle
to focus. But this strategy is likely to backfire.19 Instead, pay
attention to the causes of your stress and inability to focus, and then
take actions that promote improvements in the specific brain functions
that drive concentration and awareness.</p>
