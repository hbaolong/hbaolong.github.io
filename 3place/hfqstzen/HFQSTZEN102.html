<h4 id="how-to-make-yourself-work-when-you-just-dont-want-to">5 How to
Make Yourself Work When You Just Don’t Want To</h4>
<p>By Heidi Grant</p>
<p>There’s that project you’ve left on the back burner—the one with the
deadline that’s growing uncomfortably near. And there’s the client whose
phone call you really should return—the one who does nothing but
complain and eat up your valuable time. Wait, weren’t you going to try
to go to the gym more often this year?</p>
<p>Can you imagine how much less guilt, stress, and frustration you
would feel if you could somehow just make yourself do the things you
don’t want to do when you are actually supposed to do them? Not to
mention how much happier and more effective you would be?</p>
<p>The good news (and it’s very good news) is that you can get better
about not putting things off if you use the right strategy. Figuring out
which strategy to use depends on why you are procrastinating in the
first place. Here are some of the most likely reasons.</p>
<p>Reason #1: You are putting something off because you are afraid
you’ll screw it up</p>
<p>Solution: Adopt a “prevention focus”</p>
<p>There are two ways to look at any task. You can do something because
you see it as a way to end up better off than you are now—as an
achievement or accomplishment. As in, “If I complete this project
successfully I will impress my boss,” or “If I work out regularly, I
will look amazing.” Psychologists call this a promotion focus, and
research shows that when you have one, you are motivated by the thought
of making gains, and you work best when you feel eager and optimistic.
Sounds good, doesn’t it? Well, if you are afraid you will screw up on
the task in question, this is not the focus type for you. Anxiety and
doubt undermine promotion motivation, leaving you less likely to take
any action at all.</p>
<p>What you need is a way of looking at what you need to do that isn’t
undermined by doubt but rather, ideally, thrives on it. When you have a
prevention focus, instead of thinking about how you can end up better
off, you see the task as a way to hang on to what you already have—to
avoid loss. For the prevention focused, successfully completing a
project is a way to keep your boss from being angry or thinking less of
you. Working out regularly is a way to not “let yourself go.” Decades of
research, which I describe in my book Focus, shows that prevention
motivation is actually enhanced by anxiety about what might go wrong.
When you are focused on avoiding loss, it becomes clear that the only
way to get out of danger is to take immediate action. The more worried
you are, the faster you are out of the gate.</p>
<p>I know this doesn’t sound like a barrel of laughs, particularly if
you are usually more the promotion-minded type, but there is probably no
better way to get over your anxiety about screwing up than to give some
serious thought to all the dire consequences of doing nothing at all. So
go on, scare the pants off yourself. It feels awful, but it works.</p>
<p>Reason #2: You are putting something off because you don’t feel like
doing it</p>
<p>Solution: Make like Spock and ignore your feelings. They’re getting
in your way</p>
<p>In his excellent book The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can’t
Stand Positive Thinking, Oliver Burkeman points out that often when we
say things like “I just can’t get out of bed early in the morning,” or
“I just can’t get myself to exercise,” what we really mean is that we
can’t get ourselves to feel like doing these things. After all, no one
is tying you to your bed every morning. Intimidating bouncers aren’t
blocking the entrance to your gym. Physically, nothing is stopping you:
You just don’t feel like it. But as Burkeman asks, “Who says you need to
wait until you ‘feel like’ doing something in order to start doing
it?”</p>
<p>Think about that for a minute, because it’s really important.
Somewhere along the way, we’ve all bought into the idea—without
consciously realizing it—that to be motivated and effective we need to
feel like we want to take action. We need to be eager to do so. I really
don’t know why we believe this, because it is 100% nonsense. Yes, on
some level you need to be committed to what you are doing—you need to
want to see the project finished, or get healthier, or get an earlier
start to your day. But you don’t need to feel like doing it.</p>
<p>In fact, as Burkeman points out, many of the most prolific artists,
writers, and innovators have become successful in part because of their
reliance on work routines that forced them to put in a certain number of
hours a day, no matter how uninspired (or, in many instances, hung over)
they might have felt. Burkeman reminds us of renowned artist Chuck
Close’s observation that “Inspiration is for amateurs. The rest of us
just show up and get to work.”</p>
<p>So if you’re sitting there, putting something off because you don’t
feel like doing it, remember that you don’t actually need to feel like
it. There is nothing stopping you.</p>
<p>Reason #3: You are putting something off because it’s hard, boring,
or otherwise unpleasant</p>
<p>Solution: Use if-then planning</p>
<p>Too often, we try to solve this particular problem with sheer will:
Next time, I will make myself start working on this sooner. Of course,
if we actually had the willpower to do that, we would never put it off
in the first place. Studies show that people routinely overestimate
their capacity for self-control and rely on it too often to keep them
out of hot water.</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor and embrace the fact that your willpower is
limited. Your will may not always be up to the challenge of getting you
to do things you find difficult, tedious, or otherwise awful. Instead,
use if-then planning to get the job done.</p>
<p>Making an if-then plan is more than just deciding what specific steps
you need to take to complete a project: It’s also deciding where and
when you will take those steps. For example:</p>
<p>If it is 2 p.m., then I will stop what I’m doing and start work on
the report Bob asked for. If my boss doesn’t mention my request for a
raise at our meeting, then I will bring it up again before the meeting
ends.</p>
<p>By deciding in advance exactly what you’re going to do—and when and
where you’re going to do it—there’s no deliberating when the time comes.
There’s no Do I really have to do this now? Or Can this wait till later?
Or Maybe I should do something else instead. It’s when we deliberate
that willpower becomes necessary to make the tough choice. If-then plans
dramatically reduce the demands placed on your willpower by ensuring
that you’ve made the right decision way ahead of the critical moment. In
fact, if-then planning has been shown in more than 200 studies to
increase rates of goal attainment and productivity by 200% to 300% on
average.</p>
<p>I realize that the three strategies I’m offering you—thinking about
the consequences of failure, ignoring your feelings, and engaging in
detailed planning—don’t sound as fun as advice like “Follow your
passion!” or “Stay positive!” But they have the decided advantage of
actually being effective—which, as it happens, is exactly what you’ll be
if you use them.</p>
