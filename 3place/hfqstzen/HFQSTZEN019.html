<h4 id="three-things-managers-should-be-doing-every-day">3 Three Things
Managers Should Be Doing Every Day</h4>
<p>By Linda A. Hill and Kent Lineback</p>
<p>“When are we supposed to do all that?” That’s the question we
constantly get from new managers, only weeks or months into their
positions, when we describe the three key activities they should be
focusing on to be successful as leaders: building trust, building a
team, and building a broader network. To their dismay, most of them have
found they rarely end a day in their new positions having done what they
planned to do. They spend most of their time solving unexpected problems
and making sure their groups do their work on time, on budget, and up to
standard. They feel desperately out of control because what’s urgent—the
daily work—always seems to highjack what’s important—their ongoing work
as managers and leaders.</p>
<p>So they push back because they think we’ve just made their to-do list
even longer. And these key elements (we call them the “Three Imperatives
of Leading and Managing”) are not quick and easy wins—they are
substantial and fundamental to one’s ability to function effectively as
a leader. Here’s why:</p>
<p>Building trust. Successful leadership is, at root, about influencing
others, and trust is the foundation of all ability to influence others.
You cannot influence anyone who does not trust you. Thus the manager
must work to cultivate the trust of everyone they work with. They do
this by demonstrating the two basic components of trust: competence and
character. Competence doesn’t mean being the resident expert in every
thing the group does; it does mean understanding the work well enough to
make solid decisions about it and having the courage to ask questions
where they may be less knowledgeable. Character means basing decisions
and actions on values that go beyond self-interest and truly caring
about the work, about the customers (internal or external) for whom they
do the work, and about the people doing the work. If people believe in
your competence and character, they will trust you to do the right
thing.</p>
<p>Building a real team and managing through it. An effective team is
bound together by a common, compelling purpose, based on shared values.
In a genuine team, the bonds among members are so strong that they truly
believe they will all succeed or fail together and that no individual
can win if the team loses. Besides purpose and values, strong teams also
have rules of engagement: explicit and implicit understandings of how
members work together. For example, what kinds of conflict are allowed,
and what kinds are not? Smart leaders make sure all the elements that
create a real team are in place—purpose, values, rules—and then manage
through the team. So instead of saying, “Do it because I’m the boss,”
they say, “Do it for the team,” which is a much more powerful approach.
In a real team, members value their membership and strive mightily not
to let their comrades down. The smart leader builds and uses these
powerful ties to shape behavior.</p>
<p>Building a network. Every team depends on the support and
collaboration of outside people and groups. Effective group leaders
proactively build and maintain a network of these outsiders, which
includes not just those needed for today’s work but also those the group
will need to achieve future goals. This is without a doubt the
imperative that most troubles new managers. They think “networking” is
manipulative organizational politicking that requires them to pretend
they like people just because they want something from them. They strive
to be above that sort of thing. Alas, in the process, they unnecessarily
limit their own and their group’s ability to influence others for good
ends. Building a network can be politicking, but it need not be if they
do it honestly, openly, and with the genuine intent of creating
relationships that benefit both sides.</p>
<p>It is here, after covering these imperatives, that we hear the
question, “When are we supposed to build trust, build a team, and create
a network? How do we do that on top of everything else we have to
do?”</p>
<p>Our answer is that the “Three Imperatives” and all that each embodies
are not discrete tasks to put on a to-do. Instead, strong, effective
leaders manage and lead through the daily work. They do this in the way
they define, assign, structure, talk about, review, and generally guide
that work. They are masters at using the daily work and its inevitable
crises to perform their work as managers and leaders.</p>
<p>How do they do this?</p>
<p>They build trust by taking the opportunity to demonstrate their
ability as they do their daily work, by asking knowledgeable questions
and offering insightful suggestions. They use daily decisions and
choices to illustrate their own values, expressing their concern for
those who work for them or those for whom the group does its work. They
reveal themselves, but not in an egotistical way, showing what they
know, what they believe, and what they value—and in doing this, they
show themselves to be trustworthy.</p>
<p>They build a team by using problems and crises in the daily work to
remind members of the team’s purpose and what it values most. They
explain their decisions in these terms. They immediately call out team
members who violate a rule of engagement—treating each other
disrespectfully, for example—or who place their interests above those of
the team. And since the rules apply to all members, including the
leader, they ask team members to hold the leader accountable if she ever
forgets one of those rules.</p>
<p>They build a network by taking opportunities afforded by routine
activities—a regular meeting of department heads, for example, or even a
chance meeting in the elevator—to build and maintain relationships with
colleagues outside their group. They consciously approach problems that
involve another group leader in a way that both solves the problem and
fosters a long-term relationship. They proactively share information
with outsiders who would benefit from it. They encourage their group
members to take the same approach when they deal with outsiders.</p>
<p>These are obviously only a few of the ways good managers use their
daily work to fulfill the deeper imperatives of leadership, but you get
the idea. In fact, if there’s anything that might be called a “secret”
for not getting overwhelmed by the challenges of becoming an effective
manager, this is surely it. We’ve seen new managers light up when they
finally grasp this principle: that the daily work isn’t an impediment to
doing what good leaders do. Instead, it’s the way, the vehicle, to do
most of what good managers do.</p>
<p>Once they learn this lesson, they look at their daily work
differently. For every new task, for every unexpected problem, they take
a moment to step back and ask, How can I use this to foster trust? To
build and strengthen us as a team? To expand our network and make it
stronger?</p>
