Your Team’s Time Management Problem Might Be a Focus Problem</h4>
<p>By Maura Thomas</p>
<p>My team has a time management problem,” leaders often tell me.
Executives might say, for example, that their teams aren’t moving the
needle on important projects, yet staffers seem busy and stressed. “Time
management” becomes a catchall solution to this problem, and they want
to hire me to offer tips and techniques on things like prioritizing and
using their calendars better.</p>
<p>What we soon uncover, however, is that the root of the team’s
problems is not managing time, but managing attention. And these
attention management issues are due not to a skills gap on the part of
the employees but to a wider cultural problem unintentionally
reinforced, or at least tolerated, by senior leadership.1</p>
<p>Distraction is one of the biggest hurdles to high-quality knowledge
work, costing almost trillion annually.2 The first step to addressing
this problem is to treat it as a company culture issue that deserves the
attention of senior executives.</p>
<p>In my experience, many leaders inadvertently allow or even actively
promote the following four situations that impede their team’s ability
to focus and produce their best work.</p>
<p>They create an environment that undermines focus</p>
<p>The products of knowledge work are creativity, ideas, decisions,
information, and communication. All of these require extended periods of
sustained focus. However, many offices have a culture in which all
communication, regardless of the subject or source, carries the same
level of presumed urgency and is expected to produce an immediate
response.</p>
<p>Sometimes this happens out of a customer service requirement:
Leadership mandates that custom ers or clients should receive timely
responses to all communication. But if “timely” isn’t specific and
realistic, the assumption grows that faster is better—and immediate is
best. Since workers never know whether incoming messages are from
customers or from someone else, they must monitor messages constantly.
Therefore every other task is tackled intermittently, in increments of
30 to 120 seconds, around the handling of messages.</p>
<p>Saying, “Just acknowledge the message, and let them know you’ll get
back to them soon” does not alleviate the problem, since workers still
have to monitor their messages to know that this response is required.
The problem is exacerbated when employees are issued a second computer
monitor, which they use to have their email open on one screen while
keeping whatever work they are trying to get done up on the other
screen. This is a recipe for constant distraction, seemingly endorsed by
the leaders who provide the hardware.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, divert customer- or client-facing issues to
dedicated customer service personnel, whose role is more geared toward
reactive tasks. Free up high-impact employees to have more uninterrupted
time to focus on their responsibilities. If you can’t designate
employees for specific customer response roles, then create a realistic
response window, such as four hours or one business day, perhaps with an
auto-responder instructing clients to call when a timely response is
required. Will your customers really leave you if you don’t respond to
their emails immediately? When considering customer response times,
think of it this way: If your customer were sitting across from one of
your employees, you wouldn’t want the employee checking email. So even
when the customer isn’t present, the work your company provides to them
deserves the same amount of respect and undivided attention, correct? If
so, then your team has to have time away from incoming communication.
And an added benefit is that, as studies show, that work will get done
faster and better.3</p>
<p>They don’t offer clear instruction on which communication channel is
appropriate in which situation</p>
<p>Email was not designed for urgent or time-sensitive communication.
Instant messaging can be a better vehicle, but it is used for trivial
issues, critical issues, and everything in between. When every
communication tool is used in every circumstance, there’s no way to vet
incoming communication except to check everything as it arrives. This
ensures constant distraction.</p>
<p>Consider using an auto-responder or a line in your email signature
that tells customers how to reach you if the matter is urgent. Also
ensure that internal communication doesn’t carry an expectation of
immediate response. Staff, especially millennials, increasingly tend to
avoid the phone and in-person communication, yet sensitive information
and urgent information are better suited to these channels. Offer
guidelines that are flexible yet specific regarding how to make
effective use of all company communication channels.</p>
<p>They assign the same workers to receive and solve customer issues</p>
<p>Even if you designate specific staff to be the front line to
customers, you will have a problem if those staff members have to both
receive the problems and solve them. After all, they won’t be able to
bring their full attention to solving the problem if they can’t take a
break from receiving more problems.</p>
<p>Try organizing your support staff’s daily schedule so that each
person has time away from phone and email to thoughtfully address
problems and get other meaningful work done. Another option would be to
appoint a “triage” person, who only handles intake and assigns problems
to others for solutions. Either choice gives support staff opportunities
to devote their full attention to solving problems. This will likely
result in happier customers. When staff members have a chance to reflect
on issues, they are better primed to recognize systemic problems and
opportunities for product and policy improvements. Train your staff to
understand that good customer service means not only responding to
customers in a timely manner but also solving their problems in a
thorough, attentive, and satisfactory way.</p>
<p>They don’t realize that monitoring internal systems is still work,
even if there is rarely an emergency</p>
<p>I have this experience in almost every training session I deliver: I
introduce the idea that downtime and vacation are critical for knowledge
workers’ success, and then the head of IT or another system-monitoring
department speaks up and says that they can never be out of touch in
case of a system failure. This is followed by a member of leadership
jumping in to say, “But it’s okay, because those kinds of emergencies
rarely happen.”</p>
<p>It’s not okay, because monitoring work for emergencies is still work.
If you have a staffer who is expected to be available 24/7/365 in case
of an “emergency,” then that person essentially gets no time off,
because they still have to monitor their work communication “just in
case.” Even if there is no emergency, there’s still other work happening
that this staffer will see. Even if they choose not to respond, their
mind will be engaged in work all the time, and there will never be a
time when they can truly unplug.</p>
<p>To address this, every role in your organization needs to have a
trusted backup. When an employee has no backup, there is risk to the
business whether that employee stays or leaves. If they leave and take
all of that business knowledge with them, it could take your company
years to recover. If they stay, they are likely to experience high
stress (which is not good for their output) or burnout (causing you to
need to replace them anyway, temporarily or permanently).4</p>
<p>If you are a leader and think your employees might be struggling with
“time management,” examine these issues first. Your first step may be to
address your culture problem around attention management. While many
employees do struggle with time and attention management, the solutions
won’t stick unless leaders address the underlying culture issues.</p>
