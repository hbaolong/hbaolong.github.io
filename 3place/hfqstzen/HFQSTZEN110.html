Successful Leaders Know What Made Them Who They Are</h4>
<p>By Bernie Swain</p>
<p>Can you identify the one person, event, or influence that made you
who you are as a leader and a person? Over the past 10 years, I’ve put
that question to 100 of the eminent people I represented as chairman of
the Washington Speakers Bureau: Madeleine Albright, Tom Brokaw, Colin
Powell, Terry Bradshaw, Condoleezza Rice, and many others. I was curious
to find out what they felt were the turning points in their lives—the
defining moments and influences from which they draw motivation and
inspiration.</p>
<p>Identifying the foundational moments of our success allows us to
maximize our potential, uncover our own passions, and become better
leaders. In my case, the defining moment in my life was the realization
that I was never going to enjoy working for other people—a recognition
that paradoxically came to me right at the moment when I was on the
verge of being offered my dream job (which I eventually turned down to
become an entrepreneur). The realization helped fuel me even during
periods of uncertainty by reinforcing my will to succeed and comforting
me that I was on the right trajectory. Everyone has such an event and
can usually identify it after some reflection. Among my interviewees,
turning points fell into three broad categories.</p>
<p>People</p>
<p>Forty-five of those interviewees identified a person as the single
most enduring influence on their lives. For Madeleine Albright, the
former U.S. secretary of state, it was her father, a serious man with
far-ranging intellect whose career as a Czechoslovak diplomat was
short-circuited twice: by the German occupation in World War II and by
the Communist takeover after the war. After the family moved to the
United States, he became a professor living in cramped faculty
housing—quite a step down from an ambassador’s residence—but worked at
his job cheerfully and diligently. She says that being secretary of
state was challenging, but she never had any trouble staying focused: “I
just had to picture my father in his flooded basement study, working
away with his feet up on bricks.”</p>
<p>For Tom Brokaw, who had been student body president and a three-sport
athlete in high school, but who then dropped out of college twice, it
was a strict and caring political science professor. For legendary
basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski, it was his mother, who had only an
eighth-grade education. Her homespun advice to always “get on the right
bus . . . filled with good people” became the moral cornerstone of
“Coach K’s” life and career.</p>
<p>Events</p>
<p>Forty of my one hundred interviewees identified an event—a failure,
an injury, a death, or the like—as the turning point in their lives.</p>
<p>What defined former secretary of labor Robert Reich, at first, was
his height. “I am 4’11“ and have always been short,” said Reich.
Starting in kindergarten, he was teased and bullied, and he learned to
find someone bigger who could act as a protector. One of those who
watched out for him was an older kid named Michael Schwerner. Years
later, in 1964, Mickey Schwerner and two other young civil rights
workers were brutally murdered in Neshoba County, Mississippi, by the Ku
Klux Klan—a crime that shocked the country and horrified Reich, who had
just graduated from high school. The event galvanized Reich, setting him
on a lifelong course of public service and commitment to social justice.
“Mickey protected me,” said Reich, now a professor at UC Berkeley. “I,
in turn, feel a responsibility to protect others.”</p>
<p>For Tony Blair, a rebellious troublemaker in school, it was his
father’s stroke, cutting short the elder Blair’s promising political
career and evoking in Tony the discipline and diligence that would
eventually make him prime minister of Great Britain.</p>
<p>Debbi Fields, founder of Mrs. Fields Cookies, found the drive and
passion to succeed as her unpretentious self when a boorish social
superior threw a dictionary in her lap because she had misused a word in
conversation.</p>
<p>Environments</p>
<p>Fifteen of my interviewees considered environments—such as a place, a
time, or an enveloping experience—as the most powerful influence in
their lives. For Condoleezza Rice, it was the love of reading and
education that was passed down through her family, beginning with her
paternal great-grandmother, Julia Head, who learned to read as a slave
on an Alabama cotton plantation. Rice’s grandfather, born in 1892 to
Julia and her sharecropper husband, was determined to go to college and
went on to become a Presbyterian minister. One day he brought home nine
leather-bound, gold-embossed books—the works of Shakespeare, Hugo, and
others—which cost 0, a huge sum at the time.</p>
<p>“My grandfather believed in having books in the home,” Rice told me,
“and, more important, he believed in having his children read them.”
Rice’s father earned two master’s degrees, and her aunt Theresa got a
PhD in Victorian literature. In 1981, when Rice received her PhD in
political science, her father gave her the five remaining books from her
grandfather’s set. They sit now on her mantelpiece.</p>
<p>For Chris Matthews, it was his stint in the Peace Corps in Swaziland
that took him off his path to academia and sent him toward a life of
engagement in politics and journalism.</p>
<p>Colin Powell’s enduring influence comes from a neighborhood in the
South Bronx called Banana Kelley, where he grew up among caring family
members and a multilingual, nurturing community of hardworking people.
“I owe whatever success I’ve had to . . . Banana Kelley,” he says.</p>
<p>Successful leaders are self-aware. That’s the overriding lesson I’ve
learned from working and talking with some the world’s most accomplished
people over the past 36 years. For some, like Powell or Albright,
identifying and owning the turning points in their lives comes easily.
But for many people, it can be difficult. It took three increasingly
painful conversations for Terry Bradshaw to fully get at his: As the
number-one pick in the NFL draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers, he paid
little heed to his coaches, goofed off in practice, and exhibited a
bravado that masked his deep insecurity as a southern country boy in a
big northern city. But as the losses piled up on the field and the boos
rained down from the stands, he could no longer sustain his
devil-may-care façade. One night he broke down crying in his apartment,
prayed, and heard a gentle voice telling him to get real. “I went to
practice the next day,” he said to me, “and I set out cultivating a new
attitude.” He went on to become one of only three quarterbacks to have
won four Super Bowls.</p>
<p>Highly accomplished people have an inner voice and pay attention to
it. They understand the defining moments of their lives and thereby
better understand their own strengths, biases, and weaknesses as
leaders. And that understanding provides them with a deep well of energy
and passion that they draw on throughout their lives. We may not all
have careers that match the 100 people I interviewed, but we can all
share their ability to grasp—and harness—the turning points of our lives
and careers.</p>
