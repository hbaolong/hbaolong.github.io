<h4 id="overcome-the-eight-barriers-to-confidence">2 Overcome the Eight
Barriers to Confidence</h4>
<p>By Rosabeth Moss Kanter</p>
<p>To get a more confident you—or a more confident company, community,
family, or team—first know what gets in the way. The best resolutions
will go nowhere without the confidence to stick with them.</p>
<p>Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome. It is not a
personality trait; it is an assessment of a situation that sparks
motivation. If you have confidence, you’re motivated to put in the
effort, to invest the time and resources, and to persist in reaching the
goal. It’s not confidence itself that produces success; it’s the
investment and the effort. Without enough confidence, it’s too easy to
give up prematurely or not get started at all. Hopelessness and despair
prevent positive action.</p>
<p>To muster the confidence to work toward your goals, avoid these eight
traps:</p>
<p>Self-defeating assumptions. You think you can’t, so you don’t. A
British Olympic runner is so rattled by a misstep that cost her a
contest that she dropped out of the next event. A company team decides
that a popular world leader is so far out of their league that they
don’t invite him to speak at their customer event. Talented women
sometimes “leave before they leave,” as Sheryl Sandberg puts it,
assuming that they won’t be promoted (or succeed when they have
children) so they start behaving like they’re departing years before
departure, thus foreclosing their options. It’s one thing to be
realistic, it’s another to behave like a loser before entering the
game.</p>
<p>Goals that are too big or too distant. I know how often leaders say
they want to tackle BHAGs—“big hairy audacious goals.” But having only
enormous goals can actually undermine confidence. The gap between a
giant goal and today’s reality can be depressing and demotivating.
Confidence comes from small wins that occur repeatedly, with each small
step moving you closer to the big goal. But the small steps must be
valued and turned into goals themselves. Winners think small as well as
big.</p>
<p>Declaring victory too soon. This is the dieter’s dilemma: You lose
the first few pounds and feel so good that you reward yourself with
chocolate cake—then when the pounds go back on, you feel so discouraged
that you have more cake to feel better. I saw this pattern in a college
football team that was coming off a nine-year losing streak (yes, nine
years!). After winning its first game in nearly a decade, a team member
shouted, “Now we’ll win the championship!” First, of course, they had to
win the next game—which they didn’t. Step-by-step discipline builds
confidence.</p>
<p>Do-it-yourself-ing. It’s a trap to think you can go it alone, without
a support system and without supporting others. Losing teams have stars,
but they focus on their own records, not how well the whole team does;
the resulting resentments and inequalities provoke internal battles that
drag everyone down. To build your confidence, think about building the
confidence of others and creating a culture in which everyone is more
likely to succeed, whether through mentoring them or recognizing their
strengths. Giving to others boosts happiness and self-esteem, as
numerous research studies show. Supporting them makes it easier to
ensure that they support you.</p>
<p>Blaming someone else. Confidence rests on taking responsibility for
one’s own behavior. Even in difficult circumstances, we have choices
about how to respond to adversity. Whining about past harms reduces
confidence about future possibilities. When the blame game is carried
out within companies, everyone loses confidence, including external
stakeholders. Confidence is the art of moving on.</p>
<p>Defensiveness. It’s one thing to listen and respond to critics; it’s
another to answer them before they’ve done anything. Don’t defend
yourself if you’re not being attacked. Apologize for your mistakes, but
don’t apologize for who or what you are. Instead, take pride in where
you’ve come from and lead with your strengths.</p>
<p>Neglecting to anticipate setbacks. Confidence involves a dose of
reality. It is not blind optimism, thinking that everything will be fine
no matter what. Confidence stems from knowing that there will be
mistakes, problems, and small losses en route to big wins. After all,
even winning sports teams are often behind at some point in the game.
Confidence grows when you look at what can go wrong, think through
alternatives, and feel you are prepared for whatever might happen.</p>
<p>Overconfidence. Confidence is a sweet spot between despair and
arrogance. Don’t let confidence slip over into the arrogant end.
Overconfidence is the bane of economies (e.g., the irrational exuberance
that preceded the global financial crisis), corrupt leaders (who assume
they’re so necessary that they won’t get into trouble for a small
expense account fudge), or individuals who swagger and feel entitled to
success rather than working for it. Arrogance and complacency lead to
neglect of the basics, deaf ears to critics, and blindness to the forces
of change—a trap for companies as well as individuals. Sure enough, like
the old proverb, “Pride goeth before a fall,” the slide into a losing
streak often begins with a winning streak. A little humility goes a long
way to moderate arrogance and keep just the right amount of
confidence.</p>
<hr />
<p>Remember, it’s not enough just to feel confident. You have to do the
work. But with an expectation of success, you can try new things, form
new partnerships, contribute to shared success, and revel in small wins
that move you toward bigger goals.</p>
