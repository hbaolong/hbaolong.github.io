<h4 id="empathy-is-key-to-a-great-meeting">4 Empathy Is Key to a Great
Meeting</h4>
<p>By Annie McKee</p>
<p>Yes, we all hate meetings. Yes, they are usually a waste of time. And
yes, they’re here to stay. So it’s your responsibility as a leader to
make them better. This doesn’t mean just making them shorter, more
efficient, and more organized. People need to enjoy them and, dare I say
it, have fun.</p>
<p>Happiness matters a lot at work. How could it not, when many of us
spend most of our waking hours there. The alternatives—chronic
frustration, discontent, and outright hatred of our jobs—are simply not
acceptable. Negative feelings interfere with creativity and innovation,
not to mention collaboration.1 And let’s face it: Meetings are, for the
most part, still where lots of collaboration, creativity, and innovation
happen.2 If meetings aren’t working, then chances are we’re not able to
do what we need to do.</p>
<p>So how do we fix meetings so they are more enjoyable and produce more
positive feelings? Sure, invite the right people, create better agendas,
and be better prepared. Those are baseline fixes. But if you really want
to improve how people work together at meetings, you’ll need to rely
on—and maybe develop—a couple of key emotional intelligence
competencies: empathy and emotional self-management.</p>
<p>Why empathy? Empathy is a competency that allows you to read people.
Who is supporting whom? Who is pissed off, and who is coasting? Where is
the resistance? This isn’t as easy as it seems. Sometimes, the smartest
resisters often look like supporters, but they’re not supportive at all.
They’re smart, sneaky idea killers.</p>
<p>Carefully reading people will also help you understand the major and
often hidden conflicts in the group. Hint: These conflicts probably have
nothing to do with the topics discussed or decisions being made at the
meeting. They are far more likely to be linked to very human dynamics
like who is allowed to influence whom (headquarters vs. the field,
expats vs. local nationals) and power dynamics between genders and among
people of various races.</p>
<p>Empathy lets you see and manage these power dynamics. Many of us
would like to think that these sorts of concerns—and office politics in
general—are beneath us, unimportant, or just for those Machiavellian
folks we all dislike. Realistically, though, power is hugely important
in groups because it is the real currency in most organizations. And it
plays out in meetings. Learning to read how the flow of power is moving
and shifting can help you lead the meeting—and everything else.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that employing empathy will help you understand how
people are responding to you. As a leader you may be the most powerful
person at the meeting. Some people, the dependent types, will defer at
every turn. That feels good, for a minute. Carry on that way, and you’re
likely to create a dependent group—or one that is polarized between
those who will do anything you want and those who will not.</p>
<p>This is where emotional self-management comes in, for a couple of
reasons. First, take a look at the dependent folks in your meetings.
Again, it can feel really good to have people admire you and agree with
your every word. In fact, this can be a huge relief in our
conflict-ridden organizations. But again, if you don’t manage your
response, you will make group dynamics worse. You will also look like a
fool. Others are reading the group, too, and they will rightly read that
you like it when people go along with you. They will see that you are
falling prey to your own ego or to those who want to please or
manipulate you.</p>
<p>Second, strong emotions set the tone for the entire group. We take
our cue from one another about how to feel about what’s going on around
us. Are we in danger? Is there cause for celebration? Should we be fed
up and cynical or hopeful and committed? Here’s why this matters in
meetings: If you, as a leader, effectively project out your more
positive emotions, such as hope and enthusiasm, others will “mirror”
these feelings and the general tone of the group will be marked by
optimism and a sense of “we’re in this together, and we can do it.”3 And
there is a strong neurological link between feelings and cognition. We
think more clearly and more creatively when our feelings are largely
positive and when we are appropriately challenged.4</p>
<p>The other side of the coin is obvious. Your negative emotions are
also contagious, and they are almost always destructive if unchecked and
unmanaged. Express anger, contempt, or disrespect, and you will
definitely push people into fight mode—individually and collectively.
Express disdain, and you’ll alienate people far beyond the end of the
meeting. And it doesn’t matter who you feel this way about. All it takes
is for people to see it, and they will catch it—and worry that next time
your target will be them.</p>
<p>This is not to say that all positive emotions are good all the time
or that you should never express negative emotions. The point is that
the leader’s emotions are highly infectious. Know this and manage your
feelings accordingly to create the kind of environment where people can
work together to make decisions and get things done.</p>
<p>It may go without saying, but you can’t do any of this with your
phone on. As Daniel Goleman shares in his book Focus: The Hidden Driver
of Excellence, we are not nearly as good at multitasking as we think we
are. Actually we stink at it. So turn it off and pay attention to the
people you are with today.</p>
<p>In the end, it’s your job to make sure people leave your meeting
feeling pretty good about what’s happened, their contributions, and you
as the leader. Empathy allows you to read what’s going on, and
self-management helps you move the group to a mood that supports getting
things done—and happiness.</p>
