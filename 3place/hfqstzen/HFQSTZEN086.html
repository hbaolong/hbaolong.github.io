<h4 id="less-confident-people-are-more-successful">14 Less Confident
People Are More Successful</h4>
<p>By Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic</p>
<p>There is no bigger cliché in business psychology than the idea that
high self-confidence is key to career success. It is time to debunk this
myth. In fact, low self-confidence is more likely to make you
successful.</p>
<p>After many years of researching and consulting on talent, I’ve come
to the conclusion that self- confidence is only helpful when it’s low.
Sure, extremely low confidence is not helpful: It inhibits performance
by inducing fear, worry, and stress, which may drive people to give up
sooner or later. But just-low-enough confidence can help you recalibrate
your goals so they are (a) more realistic and (b) attainable. Is that
really a problem? Not everyone can be CEO of Coca-Cola or the next Steve
Jobs.</p>
<p>If your confidence is low, rather than extremely low, you stand a
better chance of succeeding than if you have high self-confidence. There
are three main reasons for this:</p>
<p>Lower self-confidence makes you pay attention to negative feedback
and be self-critical. Most people get trapped in their optimistic
biases, so they tend to listen to positive feedback and ignore negative
feedback. Although this may help them come across as confident to
others, in any area of competence (e.g., education, business, sports, or
performing arts) achievement is 10% performance and 90% preparation.
Thus, the more aware you are of your soft spots and weaknesses, the
better prepared you will be.</p>
<p>Low self-confidence may turn you into a pessimist, but when pessimism
teams up with ambition it often produces outstanding performance. To be
the very best at anything, you will need to be your own harshest critic,
and that is almost impossible when your starting point is high
self-confidence. Exceptional achievers always experience low levels of
confidence and self-confidence, but they train hard and practice
continually until they reach an acceptable level of competence. Indeed,
success is the best medicine for your insecurities.</p>
<p>Lower self-confidence can motivate you to work harder and prepare
more. If you are serious about your goals, you will have more incentive
to work hard when you lack confidence in your abilities. In fact, low
confidence is only demotivating when you are not serious about your
goals.</p>
<p>Most people like the idea of being exceptional but not enough to do
what it takes to achieve it. Most people want to be slim, healthy,
attractive, and successful, but few people are willing to do what it
takes to achieve it—which suggests that they don’t really want these
things as much as they think. As the legendary Paul Arden (former
executive creative director at Saatchi andandandand Saatchi) noted: “I
want means: [I]f I want it enough I will get it. Getting what you want
means making the decisions you need to make to get what you want.” If
you really want what you say you want, then your low confidence will
only make you work harder to achieve it—because it will indicate a
discrepancy between your desired goal and your current state.</p>
<p>Lower self-confidence reduces the chances of coming across as
arrogant or being deluded. Although we live in a world that worships
those who worship themselves—from Donald Trump to Lady Gaga to the
latest reality TV “star”—the consequences of hubris are now beyond
debate. According to Gallup, more than 60% of employees either dislike
or hate their jobs, and the most common reason is that they have
narcissistic bosses. If managers were less arrogant, fewer employees
would be spending their working hours on Facebook, productivity rates
would go up, and turnover rates would go down.</p>
<p>Lower self-confidence reduces the chances not only of coming across
as arrogant but also of being deluded. Indeed, people with low
self-confidence are more likely to admit their mistakes—instead of
blaming others—and rarely take credit for others’ accomplishments. This
is arguably the most important benefit of low self-confidence because it
points to the fact that low self-confidence can bring success, not just
to individuals but also to organizations and society.</p>
<hr />
<p>In brief, if you are serious about your goals, low self-confidence
can be your biggest ally in achieving them. It will motivate you to work
hard, help you work on your limitations, and stop you from being a jerk,
deluded, or both. It is therefore time debunk the myth: High
self-confidence isn’t a blessing, and low self-confidence is not a
curse—in fact, it is the other way around.</p>
