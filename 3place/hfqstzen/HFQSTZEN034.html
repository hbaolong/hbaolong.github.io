<h4 id="what-bosses-gain-by-being-vulnerable">3 What Bosses Gain by
Being Vulnerable</h4>
<p>By Emma Seppala</p>
<p>One morning in Bangalore, South India, Archana Patchirajan, founder
of a technology startup, called her entire staff in for a meeting. When
everyone was seated, she announced that she had to let them go because
the startup had run out of funds. She could no longer pay them.
Shockingly, her staff of high-caliber engineers who had their pick of
jobs in the booming Silicon Valley of India, refused to go. They said
they would rather work for half their pay than leave her. They stayed
and kept working so hard that, a few years later, Patchirajan’s
company—Hubbl, which provides internet advertising solutions—sold for 4
million. Patchirajan continues to work on startups from the United
States, and her staff, though thousands of miles away from her,
continues to work for her.</p>
<p>What explains the connection and devotion that Patchirajan’s staff
had toward her?</p>
<p>Patchirajan’s story is particularly extraordinary when you consider
the alarming fact that according to a Gallup study, 70% of employees are
“not engaged” or are “actively disengaged” at work.1 As a consequence,
they are “less emotionally connected” and also “less likely to be
productive.” What is it about Patchirajan that not only prevented this
phenomenon in her staff but actually flipped it?</p>
<p>When I asked one of Patchirajan’s longest-standing employees what
drove him and the rest of the team to stay with her, these are some of
the things he shared: “We all work as a family because she treats us as
such.” “She knows everyone in the office and has a personal relationship
with each one of us.” “She does not get upset when we make mistakes but
gives us the time to learn how to analyze and fix the situation.”</p>
<p>If you look at these comments, they suggest that Patchirajan’s
relationship with her employees runs deeper than that of the usual
employer-employee relationship. Simply put, she is vulnerable and
authentic with them. She shared her doubts honestly when the company was
going downhill, she does not adhere to a strict hierarchy but treats her
employees like family members, and she has a personal relationship with
each one of them. Sound touchy-feely, daunting, or counterintuitive?
Here’s why it’s not.</p>
<p>Brené Brown, an expert on social connection, conducted thousands of
interviews to discover what lies at the root of social connections. A
thorough analysis of the data revealed what it was: vulnerability.
Vulnerability here does not mean being weak or submissive. To the
contrary, it implies the courage to be oneself. It means replacing
“professional distance and cool” with uncertainty, risk, and emotional
exposure. Opportunities for vulnerability present themselves to us at
work every day. Some examples Patchirajan gives of vulnerability include
calling an employee or colleague whose child is not well, reaching out
to someone who has just had a loss in their family, asking someone for
help, taking responsibility for something that went wrong at work, or
sitting by the bedside of a colleague or employee with a terminal
illness.</p>
<p>More important, Brown describes vulnerability and authenticity as
being at the root of human connection. And human connection is often
dramatically absent from workplaces. Johann Berlin, CEO of
Transformational Leadership for Excellence (TLEX), recounts an
experience he had while teaching a workshop at a Fortune 100 company.
The participants were all higher-level management. After an exercise in
which pairs of participants shared an event from their life with each
other, one of the top executive managers approached Berlin. Visibly
moved by the experience, he said “I’ve worked with my colleague for more
than 25 years and have never known about the difficult times in his
life.” In a short moment of authentic connection, this manager’s
understanding and connection with his colleague deepened in ways that
hadn’t happened in decades of working together.</p>
<p>Why is human connection missing at work? As leaders and employees, we
are often taught to keep a distance and project a certain image—one of
confidence, competence, and authority. We may disclose our vulnerability
to a spouse or close friend behind closed doors at night, but we would
never show it elsewhere during the day, let alone at work.</p>
<p>However, data suggests that we may want to revisit the idea of
projecting an image. Research shows that people subconsciously register
a lack of authenticity in others. Just by looking at someone, we
download large amounts of information. “We are programmed to observe
each other’s states so we can more appropriately interact, empathize, or
assert our boundaries—whatever the situation may require,” says Paula
Niedenthal, professor of psychology at the University of
Wisconsin–Madison. We are wired to read each others’ expressions in a
very nuanced way. This process is called “resonance,” and it is so
automatic and rapid that it often happens below our awareness.</p>
<p>Like an acute sounding board, parts of our brain internally echo what
others do and feel. Just by looking at someone, you experience them: You
internally resonate with them. Ever seen someone trip and momentarily
felt a twinge of pain for them? Observing them activates the “pain
matrix” in your brain, research shows.2 Ever been moved by the sight of
a person helping someone? You vicariously experienced it and thereby
felt elevation. Someone’s smile activates the smile muscles in our face,
while a frown activates our frown muscles, according to research by Ulf
Dimberg at Uppsala University in Sweden.3 We internally register what
another person is feeling. As a consequence, if a smile is fake, we are
more likely to feel uncomfortable than comfortable.</p>
<p>While we may try to appear perfect, strong, or intelligent to be
respected by others, pretense often has the opposite effect intended.
Paula Niedenthal’s research shows that we resonate too deeply with one
another to ignore inauthenticity.4 Just think of how uncomfortable you
feel around someone you perceive as “taking on airs” or “putting on a
show.” We tend to see right through them and feel less connected. Or
think of how you respond when you know someone is upset, but they’re
trying to conceal it. “What’s wrong?” you ask, only to be told,
“Nothing!” Rarely does this answer satisfy—because we sense it’s not
true.</p>
<p>Our brains are wired to read cues so subtle that even when we don’t
consciously register the cues, our bodies respond. For example, when
someone is angry but keeps their feelings bottled up, we may not realize
that they are angry (they don’t look angry) but still our blood pressure
will increase, according to research by James Gross at Stanford
University.5</p>
<p>Why do we feel more comfortable around someone who is authentic and
vulnerable? Because we are particularly sensitive to signs of
trustworthiness in our leaders.6 Servant leadership, for example, which
is characterized by authenticity and values-based leadership, yields
more positive and constructive behavior in employees and greater
feelings of hope and trust in both the leader and the organization.7 In
turn, trust in a leader improves employee performance.8 You can even see
this at the level of the brain. Employees who recall a boss who
resonated with them show enhanced activation in parts of the brain
related to positive emotion and social connection.9 The reverse is true
when they think of a boss who did not resonate.</p>
<p>One example of authenticity and vulnerability is forgiveness.
Forgiveness doesn’t mean tolerance of error but rather a patient
encouragement of growth. Forgiveness is what Archana Patchirajan’s
employee described as, “She does not get upset when we make mistakes but
gives us the time to learn how to analyze and fix the situation.”
Forgiveness may be another soft-sounding term but, as University of
Michigan researcher Kim Cameron points out in the book Positive
Organizational Behavior, it has hard results: A culture of forgiveness
in organizations can lead to increased employee productivity as well as
less voluntary turnover.10 Again, a culture that is forgiving breeds
trust. As a consequence, an organization becomes more resilient in times
of organizational stress or downsizing.</p>
<p>Why do we fear vulnerability or think it’s inappropriate for the
workplace? For one, we are afraid that if someone finds out who we
really are or discovers a soft or vulnerable spot, they will take
advantage of us. However, as I describe in my hbr.org article, “The Hard
Data on Being a Nice Boss,” kindness goes further than the old
sink-or-swim paradigm.</p>
<p>Here’s what may happen if you embrace an authentic and vulnerable
stance: Your staff will see you as a human being; they may feel closer
to you, they may be prompted to share advice, and—if you are attached to
hierarchy—you may find that your team begins to feel more horizontal.
While these types of changes might feel uncomfortable, you may see, as
in Patchirajan’s case, that the benefits are worth it.</p>
<p>There are additional benefits you may reap from a closer connection
to employees, too. One study out of Stanford shows that CEOs are looking
for more advice and counsel but that two thirds of them don’t get it.11
This isolation can skew perspectives and lead to potentially
disadvantageous leadership choices. Who better to receive advice from
than your own employees, who are intimately familiar with your product,
your customers, and problems that might exist within the
organization?</p>
<p>Rather than feeling like another peg in the system, your team members
will feel respected and honored for their opinions and will consequently
become more loyal. The research shows that the personal connection and
happiness employees derive from their work fosters greater loyalty than
the amount on their paycheck.12</p>
