<h4 id="what-gets-in-the-way-of-listening">2 What Gets in the Way of
Listening</h4>
<p>By Amy Jen Su and Muriel Maignan Wilkins</p>
<p>As your role grows in scale and influence, so too must your ability
to listen. But listening is one of the toughest skills to master—and it
requires uncovering deeper barriers within oneself.</p>
<p>Take, for example, our client, Janet, a successful principal in a
management-consulting firm. She recently received 360-degree feedback
from colleagues that she needed to improve her listening skills. This
confused her: She had always thought of herself as an active listener.
When we asked her colleagues why, they described how she wouldn’t
exactly answer questions in meetings—and how she often had different
takeaways from the rest of the team. Janet wanted to explore what was
happening. It seemed simple enough, and yet why was she having trouble?
The key, ironically, was for her to focus on herself. Here’s what
she—and you—should do.</p>
<p>Ignore your inner critic</p>
<p>Janet realized that she wasn’t tracking to the dialogue because she
was nervous about her own performance. Her mind was attuned to a
different voice—that of her own inner critic—monitoring how she was
doing in the meeting. This was especially true during presentations.
Janet’s performance anxiety overshadowed her ability to hear the
concerns underlying each question and kept her from noticing the
audience’s cues to move along. Shift your focus from “getting a good
grade” to the presentation’s greater purpose. What excites you about the
topic or audience?</p>
<p>Expand how you see your role</p>
<p>To fully listen, you must first believe doing so is a critical part
of your job. To quote from Boris Groysberg and Michael Slind’s Harvard
Business Review article “Leadership Is a Conversation,” “Leaders who
take organizational conversation seriously know when to stop talking and
start listening.” As Janet continued to explore why she wasn’t
listening, she realized she’d boxed herself in. As a management
consultant, she described her role as “providing efficient solutions to
clients.” We discussed how she might update her view from problem solver
to trusted adviser: one that not only provided counsel but also listened
deeply to clients’ issues and concerns. Consider if you’ve boxed
yourself in by role definition. Do you believe your only job is to
provide direction?</p>
<p>Put aside your fear and anticipation</p>
<p>Listening demands being fully present and ready to respond to what
might get thrown your way. But our listening shuts down when we’re
anticipating what might happen next. Janet found that while another
person was talking, her mind was already thinking about what she might
say next or anticipating what might be said. This was especially true
during difficult conversations, when she anticipated confrontation.
She’d rush through what she wanted to say without listening as a way to
avoid her fears of conflict. But listening is an especially important
skill in navigating difficult conversations, where multiple interests
and agendas must be aligned. Our full attention is demanded to
understand what the hot-button issues are or what the potential
misunderstandings might be. Notice if your listening shuts down when
you’re emotionally uncomfortable. Are you aware of your triggers?</p>
<p>Be open to having your mind changed</p>
<p>Janet also realized that she was working hard to appear confident and
to make sure she was offering her point of view in meetings. In trying
to be more assertive, she came off as having prematurely made up her
mind. One of Janet’s partners shared this tip: “I do have a viewpoint
going in, but I don’t assume or try to show I’m the smartest person in
the room. In fact, I go in with the assumption that my colleagues are
smart too and therefore might have good reason for having a different
position. I’m willing to hear them out for the sake of getting to the
best answer, not just my answer.” Listening, then, is actually a sign of
incredible self-confidence. Are you trying too hard to convey confidence
and missing others’ perspectives in the process?</p>
<p>While tactically there are many ways to strengthen your listening
skills, you must focus on the deeper, internal issues at stake to really
improve. Listening is a skill that enables you to align people,
decisions, and agendas. You cannot have leadership presence without
hearing what others have to say.</p>
