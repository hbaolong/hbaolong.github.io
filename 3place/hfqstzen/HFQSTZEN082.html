Great Leaders Are Confident, Connected, Committed, and Courageous</h4>
<p>By Peter Bregman</p>
<p>Brad was leading a difficult turnaround of his company and had
decided to fire his head of sales, who was a nice guy but wasn’t
performing.</p>
<p>Three months later, he still hadn’t fired him.</p>
<p>I asked him why. His answer? “I’m a wimp!”</p>
<p>Brad (not his real name—I’ve changed some details to protect people’s
privacy) is the CEO of a financial services firm and is most definitely
not a wimp. He’s a normal human, just like you and me. And he’s
struggling to follow through on an important, strategic decision. Just
like, at times, you and I do.</p>
<p>No matter your age, your role, your position, your title, your
profession, or your status, to get your most important work done, you
have to have hard conversations, create accountability, and inspire
action.</p>
<p>In order to do that, you need to show up powerfully and magnetically
in a way that attracts people to trust you, follow you, and commit to
putting 100% of their effort into a larger purpose, something bigger
than all of you. You need to care about others and connect with them in
such a way that they feel your care. You need to speak persuasively—in a
way that’s clear, direct, and honest and that reflects your care—while
listening with openness, compassion, and love. Even when being
challenged.</p>
<p>And, of course, you need to follow through quickly and
effectively.</p>
<p>In 25 years of working with leaders to do all of the above, I have
found a pattern that I share in my book, Leading with Emotional Courage,
consisting of four essential elements that all great leaders rely on to
rally people to accomplish what’s important to them. To lead
effectively—really, to live effectively—you must be confident in
yourself, connected to others, committed to purpose, and emotionally
courageous.</p>
<p>Most of us are great at only one of the four. Maybe two. But to be a
powerful presence—to inspire action—you need to excel at all four
simultaneously.</p>
<p>If you’re confident in yourself but disconnected from others,
everything will be about you and you’ll alienate the people around you.
If you’re connected to others but lack confidence in yourself, you will
betray your own needs and perspectives in order to please everyone else.
If you’re not committed to a purpose, something bigger than yourself and
others, you’ll flounder, losing the respect of those around you as you
act aimlessly, failing to make an impact on what matters most. And if
you fail to act powerfully, decisively, and boldly—with emotional
courage—your ideas will remain idle thoughts and your goals will remain
unfulfilled fantasies.</p>
<p>Let’s apply this to Brad and identify precisely where and how he was
getting stuck.</p>
<p>Confident in yourself</p>
<p>Brad struggled with this element, which might feel surprising since
he was so successful in his career. But this is not uncommon. He worked
tremendously hard, but it came from some degree of insecurity—he wanted
to prove himself and please those around him. He became unnerved in the
face of potential failure and was not particularly gentle or
compassionate with himself when he did fail. He did have important
strengths in this element: He saw the person he wanted to become and he
worked toward that future, putting aside distractions and investing his
energy wisely and strategically.</p>
<p>Connected to others</p>
<p>This was Brad’s greatest strength. He was well-loved and always took
great care of his team. People clearly knew and felt that he trusted
them, even when he disagreed with them. They appreciated his
curiosity—about people and problems—and were grateful that he did not
draw quick conclusions about them. All that said, even in this element,
he had room to grow: He was not always direct with people and tended to
procrastinate on difficult conversations.</p>
<p>Committed to purpose</p>
<p>This was a mixed element for Brad. On the one hand, Brad was clear
about what needed to get done to grow the firm, he engaged people in the
early stages of work, and he was open and willing to ask for help. On
the other hand, he was somewhat scattered. He wasn’t clear enough about
the small number of things that would move the needle, and he didn’t
have a reliable process for staying focused on the most important
things, ensuring accountability and driving follow-through. Not firing
his head of sales sent a mixed message to his team—was he really serious
about the firm’s success?</p>
<p>Emotionally courageous</p>
<p>Brad had room to grow here, and it turned out to be an important
element for growing his strength in the other three elements. Risks, by
definition, make us feel vulnerable, and Brad avoided that feeling. He
resisted the unknown and intentionally avoided uncomfortable situations.
This made it hard for him to tell people hard truths and make hard
decisions quickly, which stalled his actions.</p>
<hr />
<p>So Brad’s strongest element was “connected to others,” followed by
“committed to purpose.” He was weaker in “confident in yourself” and
“emotionally courageous.”</p>
<p>Which puts his challenge in perspective: His connection to his head
of sales was at war with his commitment to the success of his team and
company. Meanwhile, his confidence in himself and his emotional courage
weren’t strong enough to break the tie. That’s a recipe for inaction and
painful frustration.</p>
<p>Just knowing what was happening helped him immediately. We spent some
time strengthening his emotional courage by taking small risks while
feeling the emotions he had been trying to keep at bay. Each time he
followed through, regardless of whether he succeeded, he obviously
survived and also felt the accomplishment of addressing the risk itself.
Which, of course, built his confidence. Which helped him take bigger
risks.</p>
<p>In a short time, he felt prepared (even though he may never have felt
“ready”) to follow through on what he had known he needed to do for the
past three months. With his natural care, compassion, and humanity, he
fired his head of sales (who, by the way, and unsurprisingly, knew it
was coming and said he felt “relieved”).</p>
<p>Brad was extremely uncomfortable going into the conversation—that’s
almost always the feeling you’ll have when you do anything that requires
emotional courage.</p>
<p>But using emotional courage builds your emotional courage. Brad
emerged from the conversation stronger in all four elements: He was more
confident in himself, more connected to his team (and even, believe it
or not, his head of sales), more committed to purpose, and more
emotionally courageous.</p>
