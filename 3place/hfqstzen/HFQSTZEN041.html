<h4 id="what-great-listeners-actually-do">3 What Great Listeners
Actually Do</h4>
<p>By Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman</p>
<p>Chances are you think you’re a good listener. People’s appraisal of
their listening ability is much like their assessment of their driving
skills, in that the great bulk of adults think they’re above
average.</p>
<p>In our experience, most people think good listening comes down to
doing three things:</p>
<p>Not talking when others are speaking</p>
<p>Letting others know you’re listening through facial expressions and
verbal sounds (“Mm-hmm”)</p>
<p>Being able to repeat what others have said, practically word for
word</p>
<p>In fact, much management advice on listening suggests that people
should do these very things—encouraging listeners to remain quiet, nod
and “mm-hmm” encouragingly, and then repeat back to the talker something
like, “So, let me make sure I understand. What you’re saying is . . .”
However, recent research that we’ve conducted suggests that these
behaviors fall far short of describing good listening skills.</p>
<p>We analyzed data that describes the behavior of 3,492 participants in
a development program designed to help managers become better coaches.
As part of this program, participants’ coaching skills were evaluated
through 360-degree assessments. We identified the individuals who were
perceived as being the most effective listeners (the top 5%). We then
compared the best listeners with the average of all other people in the
data set and identified the 20 characteristics that seemed to set them
apart. With those results in hand we identified the factors that
differed between great and average listeners and analyzed the data to
determine which characteristics their colleagues identified as the
behaviors that made them outstanding listeners.</p>
<p>We found some surprising characteristics, along with some qualities
we expected to hear. We grouped them into four main findings:</p>
<p>Good listening is much more than being silent while the other person
talks. To the contrary, people perceive the best listeners to be those
who periodically ask questions that promote discovery and insight. These
questions gently challenge old assumptions but do so in a constructive
way. Sitting there silently nodding does not provide sure evidence that
a person is listening, but asking a good question tells the speaker the
listener has not only heard what was said but that they comprehended it
well enough to want additional information. Good listening was
consistently seen as a two-way dialogue, rather than a one-way “speaker
versus hearer” interaction. The best conversations were active.</p>
<p>Good listening includes interactions that build up a person’s
self-esteem. The best listeners make the conversation a positive
experience for the other party, which doesn’t happen when the listener
is passive (or critical, for that matter). Good listeners make the other
person feel supported and convey confidence in the speaker. Good
listening is characterized by the creation of a safe environment in
which issues and differences can be discussed openly.</p>
<p>Good listening is seen as a cooperative conversation. In the
interactions we studied, feedback flowed smoothly in both directions
with neither party becoming defensive about comments the other made. By
contrast, poor listeners were seen as competitive—as listening only to
identify errors in reasoning or logic, using their silence as a chance
to prepare their next response. That might make you an excellent
debater, but it doesn’t make you a good listener. Good listeners may
challenge assumptions and disagree, but the person being listened to
feels the listener is trying to help rather than trying to win an
argument.</p>
<p>Good listeners tend to make suggestions. In the study, good listening
invariably included some feedback that was provided in a way others
would accept and that opened up alternative paths to consider. This
finding somewhat surprised us, since it’s not uncommon to hear
complaints that “So-and-so didn’t listen, he just jumped in and tried to
solve the problem.” Perhaps what the data is telling us is that making
suggestions is not itself the problem; it may be more about the skill
with which those suggestions are made. Another possibility is that we’re
more likely to accept suggestions from people we already think are good
listeners. (Someone who is silent for the whole conversation and then
jumps in with a suggestion may not be seen as credible. Someone who
seems combative or critical and then tries to give advice may not be
seen as trustworthy.)</p>
<p>While many of us may think of being a good listener like being a
sponge that accurately absorbs what the other person is saying, what
these findings show is that instead, good listeners are like
trampolines: You can bounce ideas off of them, and rather than absorbing
your ideas and energy, they amplify, energize, and clarify your
thinking. They make you feel better not by merely passively absorbing,
but by actively supporting. This lets you gain energy and height, just
like a trampoline.</p>
<p>Of course, there are different levels of listening. Not every
conversation requires the highest levels of listening, but many
conversations would benefit from greater focus and listening skill.
Consider which level of listening you’d like to aim for.</p>
<p>Level 1: The listener creates a safe environment in which difficult,
complex, or emotional issues can be discussed.</p>
<p>Level 2: The listener clears away distractions like phones and
laptops, focusing attention on the other person and making appropriate
eye contact. (This behavior not only affects how you are perceived as
the listener; it immediately influences the listener’s own attitudes and
inner feelings. Acting the part changes how you feel inside. This in
turn makes you a better listener.)</p>
<p>Level 3: The listener seeks to understand the substance of what the
other person is saying. They capture ideas, ask questions, and restate
issues to confirm that their understanding is correct.</p>
<p>Level 4: The listener observes nonverbal cues, such as facial
expressions, perspiration, respiration rates, gestures, posture, and
numerous other subtle body language signals. It is estimated that 80% of
what we communicate comes from these signals. It sounds strange to some,
but you listen with your eyes as well as your ears.</p>
<p>Level 5: The listener increasingly understands the other person’s
emotions and feelings about the topic at hand and identifies and
acknowledges them. The listener empathizes with and validates those
feelings in a supportive, nonjudgmental way.</p>
<p>Level 6: The listener asks questions that clarify assumptions the
other person holds and helps the other person see the issue in a new
light. This could include the listener injecting some thoughts and ideas
about the topic that could be useful to the other person. However, good
listeners never highjack the conversation so that they or their issues
become the subject of the discussion.</p>
<p>Each of the levels builds on the others; thus, if you’ve been
criticized for offering solutions rather than listening, it may mean you
need to attend to some of the other levels (such as clearing away
distractions or empathizing) before your proffered suggestions can be
appreciated.</p>
<p>We suspect that in being a good listener, most of us are more likely
to stop short rather than go too far. Our hope is that this research
will help by providing a new perspective on listening. We hope those who
labor under an illusion of superiority about their listening skills will
see where they really stand. We also hope the common perception that
good listening is mainly about acting like an absorbent sponge will
wane. Finally, we hope all will see that the highest and best form of
listening comes in playing the same role for the other person that a
trampoline would play for a child: It gives energy, acceleration,
height, and amplification. These are the hallmarks of great
listening.</p>
