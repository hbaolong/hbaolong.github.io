<h4 id="finding-meaning-at-work-even-when-your-job-is-dull">1 Finding
Meaning at Work, Even When Your Job Is Dull</h4>
<p>By Morten Hansen and Dacher Keltner</p>
<p>Do you experience meaning at work—or just emptiness?</p>
<p>In the United States, people spend an average of 35 to 40 hours
working every week. That’s some 80,000 hours during a career—more time
than you will spend with your kids probably. Beyond the paycheck, what
does work give you? Few questions could be more important. It is sad to
walk through life experiencing work as empty, dreadful, a
chore—something that saps energy out of your body and soul. Yet many
employees feel this way, as evidenced by one large-scale study showing
that only 31% of employees were engaged.1</p>
<p>Work can, however, provide an array of meaningful experiences, even
though many employees do not enjoy them in their current job. So what
are the sources of meaningful experiences at work?</p>
<p>We have compiled a list based on our reading of literature in
organization behavior and psychology. Many theories speak to meaning at
work, including need-based, motivational, status, power, and community
theories. The phrase “meaning at work” refers to a person’s experience
of something meaningful—something of value—that work provides. That is
not the same as “meaningful work,” which refers to the task itself. Work
is a social arena that offers other kinds of meaningful experiences as
well.</p>
<p>Before we run through the list, it is important to note:</p>
<p>Different people look for different types of meaning.</p>
<p>Different workplaces provide different meanings.</p>
<p>Purpose</p>
<p>Contributions beyond yourself</p>
<p>The people at nonprofit Kiva channel microloans to poor people who
can use the money to get a small business going and improve their lives.
Their work clearly has a greater purpose—that of helping people in need.
This taps into a longing to have a meaningful life defined as making
contributions beyond oneself.</p>
<p>The problem is, however, that most work doesn’t have such a higher
purpose, either because the job is basically mundane or because—let’s
face it—the company doesn’t really have a social mission. Critics of
workplace culture like economics researcher Umair Haque argue that work
that involves selling yet more burgers, sugar water, high-fashion
clothing, and the like has no broader purpose whatsoever. In this view,
Coke’s “Open happiness” tagline is just a slogan devoid of meaning.
However, as researchers Teresa Amabile and Steve Kramer argue, much work
can be infused with some level of purpose. (See chapter 9 of this book
for more on gradual steps toward meaningful work.) Companies that make
real efforts in social responsibilities do this. For example, Danone,
the 5 billion large and highly successful consumer goods company that
sells yogurt, has defined their business as providing healthy foods
(which led them to sell off their biscuit business). The litmus test
here is whether employees experience that their work makes positive
contributions to others. If they do, then they experience meaning at
work.</p>
<p>Self-realization</p>
<p>Learning</p>
<p>Many MBA graduates flock to McKinsey, BCG, and other consultancies so
that they can rapidly acquire valuable skills. General Electric is
renowned for developing general managers, and people who want to become
marketers crave to learn that trade at Procter andandandand Gamble. Work
offers opportunities to learn, expand one’s horizon, and improve
self-awareness. This kind of personal growth is meaningful.</p>
<p>Accomplishment</p>
<p>Work is also a place to accomplish things and be recognized, which
leads to greater satisfaction, confidence, and self-worth. In the
documentary Jiro Dreams of Sushi we see Japan’s greatest sushi chef
devote his life to making perfect sushi. Some critics like Lucy Kellaway
at the Financial Times say there isn’t a real social mission here. But
the main character’s quest for perfection—to make better sushi all the
time—gives his life a deep sense of meaning. And for Jiro, the work
itself—making the sushi—gives him a deep intrinsic satisfaction.</p>
<p>Prestige</p>
<p>Status</p>
<p>At cocktail parties, a frequent question is “Where do you work?” The
ability to rattle off “Oh, I am a doctor at Harvard Medical School”
oozes status. For some, that moment is worth all the grueling night
shifts. A high-status organization confers respect, recognition, and a
sense of worth to employees, and that provides meaning at work for
some.</p>
<p>Power</p>
<p>As Paul Lawrence and Nitin Nohria write about in their book Driven,
for those drawn to power, work provides an arena for acquiring and
exercising power. You may not be one of those, but if you are, you
experience work as meaningful because you have and can use power.</p>
<p>Social rewards</p>
<p>Belonging to a community</p>
<p>Companies like Southwest Airlines go out of their way to create a
company atmosphere where people feel they belong. In a society where
people increasingly are “bowling alone,” people crave a place where they
can forge friendships and experience a sense of community. (In his book
of the same name, Robert Putnam describes the American decline in
bowling leagues as a metaphor for a larger cultural shift away from
formal social structures.2) The workplace can complement or even be a
substitute for other communities (family, the neighborhood, clubs and so
on). Workplaces that provide a sense of community give people
meaning.</p>
<p>Agency</p>
<p>Employees also experience meaning at work when what they do actually
matters for the organization, when their ideas are listened to and when
they see that their contributions have an impact on how the place
performs. A sense of real involvement gives people meaning.</p>
<p>Autonomy</p>
<p>As Dan Pink shows in his book Drive, autonomy—the absence of others
who tell you what to do and the freedom to do your own work in your own
time—is a great intrinsic motivator. Some people are drawn to certain
kinds of work that provides a great deal of autonomy. For example,
entrepreneurs frequently go into business by themselves so that they can
be their own boss. This kind of freedom gives work meaning.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are no doubt other sources as well, but the ones listed here
seem to be especially important. Which of them are important to you? And
which do you receive from your current workplace? Having more sources of
meaning is not necessarily better; experiencing one deeply may just be
enough. But it’s an issue if you don’t experience any at all.</p>
