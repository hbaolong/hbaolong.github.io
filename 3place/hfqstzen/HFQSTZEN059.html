To Sound Like a Leader, Think About What You Say, and How and When You
Say It</h4>
<p>By Rebecca Shambaugh</p>
<p>Nancy started her day feeling prepared to brief her executive team on
a high-stakes project she had been working on for the past two months.
She had rehearsed her slide deck repeatedly, to the point where she had
every level of content practically memorized. She arrived at the meeting
early and waited patiently, yet anxiously, for her part of the agenda.
The meeting began, and within a few minutes Jack, one of the cochairs,
asked her to brief the executives on her project and
recommendations.</p>
<p>Nancy enthusiastically launched into her presentation, hitting every
talking point that she had meticulously rehearsed. With a solid command
of the material, she felt at the top of her game and was relieved that
she’d spent so much time practicing and preparing for this meeting. But
just as she was about to move into her recommendations, Jack interrupted
and said, “Nancy, I appreciate your hard work on this project, but it is
not relevant to our agenda, and it doesn’t have merit for the business
objectives we’re covering today.” Mortified, Nancy retreated to her
chair and sat in silence for the rest of the meeting. She couldn’t wait
to bolt from the room the moment the meeting ended to reflect on how
this moment—which she expected would be a positive turning point in her
career—had turned into a disaster.</p>
<p>What just happened here? While Nancy was prepared to participate in
the meeting, she had failed to think strategically. This common problem
trips up many capable managers, executives, and leaders when determining
their role in communications, meetings, and other forums. Learning how
to develop and convey a more strategic executive voice—in part by
understanding context—can help leaders avoid finding themselves, as
Nancy did, in a potentially career-damaging situation.</p>
<p>Whether you are an associate manager or a senior executive, what you
say, how you say it, when you say it, to whom you say it, and whether
you say it in the proper context are critical components for tapping
into your full strategic leadership potential. If you want to establish
credibility and influence people, particularly when interacting with
other executives or senior leadership, it’s important to be concise and
let individuals know clearly what role you want them to play in the
conversation. It’s also important to demystify the content of any
message you deliver by avoiding jargon and being a person of few—but
effective—words.</p>
<p>All of these factors relate to developing a strategic executive
voice. Your executive voice is less about your performance; it relates
more to your strategic instincts, understanding of context, and
awareness of the signals you send in your daily interactions and
communications. Like its sister attribute, executive presence, executive
voice can seem somewhat intangible and thus difficult to define. But the
fact is, we all have a preferred way to communicate with others, and
doing this with strategic intent and a solid grasp of context can mean
the difference between success and failure in your communication and
leadership style.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of having an executive voice
relates to being a strategic leader. I frequently hear from top
executives that they would like to promote one of their high-potential
leaders but feel the person is not strategic enough to advance. When I
hear managers say this, I try to gently push back and suggest that maybe
the problem isn’t the candidate’s lack of strategic leadership
potential; perhaps they are failing to tap into their abilities as a
strategic leader.</p>
<p>Whether you have someone on your team who you think lacks strategic
readiness or you’re worried that you might be a leader with untapped
strategic potential due to an undeveloped executive voice, read on.
Below are some coaching strategies that I use frequently with both male
and female executives to help them add a more strategic executive voice
to their leadership tool kit.</p>
<p>Understand the context. How often do you find yourself throwing out
an unformed idea in a meeting, not speaking up when people are looking
for your ideas, or saying something that doesn’t quite fit the agenda
and suddenly getting that “deer in the headlights” feeling? If these
situations sound familiar, what is it that went wrong? In short, these
types of tactical errors come down to failing to understand the context
of the call, meeting, or discussion that you are in.</p>
<p>For example, if you are the primary authority on a topic, then it’s
likely that the context would require you to lead the meeting and make
any final decisions. But if you are one of several executives who might
have input, then sharing your view and connecting the dots with others
(rather than stealing the spotlight with your great ideas) would be your
role. If you are in learning mode and are not asked to present at a
meeting, then your role when it comes to communication would be to
observe and listen. Knowing or finding out in advance what your expected
role is in a group forum or event can guide you in determining the kind
of voice you need for that particular venue and can help ensure that you
understand the context before you speak up.</p>
<p>Be a visionary. Sometimes we fail to tap into an executive voice
because we focus too much on our own function or role. Strategic leaders
are more visionary than that, taking an enterprise view that focuses
less on themselves and more on the wider organization. Another part of
being visionary is developing the ability to articulate aspirations for
the future and a rationale for transformation.</p>
<p>This type of executive vision helps guide decisions around individual
and corporate action. You should work toward connecting the dots with
your recommendations to show how your decisions affect others around the
table, including your staff and the organization as a whole.</p>
<p>Cultivate strategic relationships. One of the best ways to build your
strategic thinking is by leveraging relationships more intentionally,
with specific business goals in mind. This calls for having senior
leaders and executives who bring a strategic perspective of the
organization’s goals, changes, and top priorities that we may normally
not have access to. When you cultivate and invest in broad strategic
relationships, it helps you avoid getting caught up in day-to-day
minutiae.</p>
<p>It’s easy to lose sight of the significance of cultivating new and
diverse relationships when you already have a full plate, but part of
being able to access a strong executive voice is expanding your
knowledge beyond your specific position, department, or area of
expertise. To develop your executive voice, take time to reach out to at
least one person each week outside of your immediate team or functional
area. Try to learn:</p>
<p>How they fit into the business as a whole</p>
<p>Their goals and challenges</p>
<p>Ways you might support them as a strategic business partner</p>
<p>Bring solutions, not just problems. While coaching a wide range of
executives, I’ve seen firsthand that most feel frustrated when people
point out challenges but don’t offer any resolutions. Leading
strategically with a strong executive voice involves problem solving,
not just finger-pointing at difficult issues.</p>
<p>You can show up more strategically by doing your homework and taking
the lead in analyzing situations. Brainstorm fresh ideas that go beyond
the obvious. Even if you don’t have the perfect answer, you can
demonstrate your ability to come up with clever solutions.</p>
<p>Stay calm in the pressure cooker. People with an effective executive
voice aren’t easily rattled. Can you provide levelheaded leadership even
when—in fact, particularly when—everyone around you is losing their
composure? When you can stick with facts instead of getting swept into
an emotional tailspin no matter how stressed you feel, you’ll be able to
lead with a more powerful executive voice.</p>
<p>It can be uncomfortable to recognize and admit personal challenges
regarding your executive voice, and at first you may get pushback when
making suggestions to improve the executive voice of those on your team.
But once you overcome this initial resistance, whether in yourself or
others, you’ll find it’s worth the up-front effort to investigate how to
contribute most effectively to important meetings and other
communications. By making the necessary adjustments to your approach to
participation, you can avoid flying blind and start showing up more
strategically in every setting.</p>
