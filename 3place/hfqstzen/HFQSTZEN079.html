<h4 id="six-ways-to-look-more-confident-during-a-presentation">7 Six
Ways to Look More Confident During a Presentation</h4>
<p>By Kasia Wezowski</p>
<p>Several years ago, colleagues and I were invited to predict the
results of a startup pitch contest in Vienna, where 2,500 tech
entrepreneurs were competing to win thousands of euros in funds. We
observed the presentations, but rather than paying attention to the
ideas the entrepreneurs were pitching, we were watching the body
language and microexpressions of the judges as they listened.</p>
<p>We gave our prediction of who would win before the winners were
announced and, as we and the audience soon learned, we were spot on. We
had spoiled the surprise.</p>
<p>Two years later, we were invited back to the same event, but this
time, instead of watching the judges, we observed the contestants. Our
task was not to guess the winners, but to determine how presenters’
nonverbal communication contributed to their success or failure.</p>
<p>We evaluated each would-be entrepreneur on a scale from 0 to 15.
People scored points for each sign of positive, confident body language,
such as smiling, maintaining eye contact, and persuasive gesturing. They
lost points for each negative signal, such as fidge ting, stiff hand
movements, and averted eyes. We found that contestants whose pitches
were rated in the top eight by competition judges scored an average of
8.3 on our 15-point scale, while those who did not place in that top
tier had an average score of 5.5. Positive body language was strongly
correlated with more successful outcomes.</p>
<p>We’ve found similar correlations in the political realm. During the
2012 U.S. Presidential election, we conducted an online study in which
1,000 participants—both Democrats and Republicans—watched two-minute
video clips featuring Barack Obama and Mitt Romney at campaign events
delivering both neutral and emotional content. Web-cams recorded the
viewers’ facial expressions, and our team analyzed them for six key
emotions identified in psychology research: happy, surprised, afraid,
disgusted, angry, and sad. We coded for the tenor of the emotion
(positive or negative) and how strongly it seemed to be expressed. This
analysis showed that Obama sparked stronger emotional responses and
fewer negative ones. Even a significant number of
Republicans—16%—reacted negatively to Romney. And when we analyzed the
candidates’ body language, we found that the president’s resembled those
of our pitch contest winners. He displayed primarily open, positive,
confident positions congruent with his speech. Romney, by contrast,
often gave out negative signals, diminishing his message with
contradictory and distracting facial expressions and movement.</p>
<p>Of course, the election didn’t hinge on body language. Nor did the
results of the startup competition. But the right kinds of nonverbal
communication did correlate with success.</p>
<p>How can you send out the same signals—and hopefully generate the same
success? At the Center for Body Language, we’ve studied successful
leaders across a range of fields and identified several positions which
are indicators of effective, persuasive body language.</p>
<p>The box</p>
<p>Early in Bill Clinton’s political career, he would punctuate his
speeches with big, wide gestures that made him appear untrustworthy. To
help him keep his body language under control, his advisers taught him
to imagine a box in front of his chest and belly and contain his hand
movements within it. Since then, “the Clinton box” has become a popular
term in the field.</p>
<p>The box: Trustworthy, truthful</p>

<hr />
<p>Holding the ball: Commanding, dominant</p>
<p>Source: Center for Body Language.</p>
<hr />
<p>Holding the ball</p>
<p>Gesturing as if you were holding a basketball between your hands is
an indicator of confidence and control, as if you almost literally have
the facts at your fingertips. Steve Jobs frequently used this position
in his speeches.</p>
<p>Pyramid hands: Self-assured, relaxed</p>
<p>Source: Center for Body Language.</p>
<hr />
<p>Pyramid hands</p>
<p>When people are nervous, their hands often flit about and fidget.
When they’re confident, they are still. One way to accomplish that is to
clasp both hands together in a relaxed pyramid. Many business executives
employ this gesture, though beware of overuse or pairing it with
domineering or arrogant facial expressions. The idea is to show you’re
relaxed, not smug.</p>
<p>Wide stance: Confident, in control</p>
<p>Source: Center for Body Language.</p>
<hr />
<p>Wide stance</p>
<p>How people stand is a strong indicator of their mindset. When you
stand in this strong and steady position, with your feet about a
shoulder width apart, it signals that you feel in control.</p>
<p>Palms up: Honest, accepting</p>
<p>Source: Center for Body Language.</p>
<hr />
<p>Palms up</p>
<p>This gesture indicates openness and honesty. Oprah makes strong use
of this during her speeches. She is a powerful, influential figure, but
also appears willing to connect sincerely with the people she is
speaking to, be it one person or a crowd of thousands.</p>
<p>Palms down: Strong, assertive</p>
<p>Source: Center for Body Language.</p>
<hr />
<p>Palms down</p>
<p>The opposite movement can be viewed positively too—as a sign of
strength, authority and assertiveness. Barack Obama has often used it to
calm a crowd right after moments of rousing oration.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next time you give a presentation, try to have it recorded, then
review the video with the sound off, watching only your body language.
How did you stand and gesture? Did you use any of these positions? If
not, think about how you might do so the next time you’re in front of an
audience, or even just speaking to your boss or a big client. Practice
in front of a mirror, then with friends, until these positions feel
natural.</p>
<p>Nonverbal communication won’t necessarily make or break you as a
leader, but it might help you achieve more successful outcomes.</p>
