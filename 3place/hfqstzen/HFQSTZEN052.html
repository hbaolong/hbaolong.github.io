<h4 id="how-to-deal-with-a-mean-colleague">4 How to Deal with a Mean
Colleague</h4>
<p>By Amy Gallo</p>
<p>When a colleague is mean to you, it can be hard to know how to
respond. Some people are tempted to let aggressive behavior slide in the
hopes that the person will stop. Others find themselves fighting back.
When you’re being treated poorly by a coworker, how can you change the
dynamic? And if the behavior persists or worsens, how do you know when
you’re dealing with a true bully?</p>
<p>What the experts say</p>
<p>“When it comes to bad behavior at work, there’s a broad spectrum,”
with outright bullies on one end and people who are simply rude on the
other, says Michele Woodward, an executive coach and host of HBR’s
webinar “Bullies, Jerks, and Other Annoyances: Identify and Defuse the
Difficult People at Work.” You may not know which end of the spectrum
you’re dealing with until you actually address the behavior. If it’s a
bully, it can be difficult—if not impossible—to get the person to
change, says Gary Namie, founder of the Workplace Bullying Institute and
author of The Bully at Work. But in most cases, you can—and should—take
action. “Know that you have a solution, you’re not powerless,” says
Woodward. Here are some tactics to consider when dealing with an
aggressive colleague.</p>
<p>Understand why</p>
<p>The first step is to understand what’s causing the behavior. Research
from Nathanael Fast, an assistant professor at the University of
Southern California’s Marshall School of Business, proves a commonly
held idea: People act out when their ego is threatened. “We often see
powerful people behave aggressively toward less powerful people when
their competence is questioned,” he says. Namie agrees: “People who are
skilled and well-liked are the most frequent targets precisely because
they pose a threat.” So it may help to stroke the aggressor’s ego. “In
our study, we saw that if the subordinate offered gratitude to the boss,
it wiped out the effect,” Fast explains. Even a small gesture, such as
ending an email with “Thanks so much for your help” or complimenting the
person on something you genuinely admire, can help.1</p>
<p>Look at what you’re doing</p>
<p>These situations also require introspection. “It’s very easy to say,
‘Oh, that person is a jerk,’” Woodward says. But perhaps you work in a
highly competitive culture or one that doesn’t prioritize politeness.
Consider whether you might be misinterpreting the behavior or
overreacting to it or whether you’ve unknowingly contributed to the
problem. Have you in any way caused the person to feel threatened or to
see you as disloyal? Self-evaluation can be tough, so get a second
opinion from someone you trust, who will tell you the truth, not just
what you want to hear. Don’t put too much of the blame on yourself,
however. “It’s important to balance not being threatening with not being
a doormat, which just invites more aggression,” Fast says. “Targets
regularly assume it’s their fault,” when it’s not, Namie agrees.</p>
<p>Stand up for yourself</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to call out the bad behavior when it happens. “I
believe very strongly in making immediate corrections,” says Woodward.
“If someone calls you ‘Honey’ in a meeting, say right then: ‘I don’t
like being called that. Please use my name,’” she says. If you’re
uncomfortable with an immediate, public response, Woodward advises
saying something as soon as you’re able. After the meeting, you could
say, “I didn’t like being called ‘Honey.’ It demeans me.” Show that
there is no reward for treating you that way. “The message should be:
Don’t mess with me; it won’t be worth your effort,” Namie says.</p>
<p>Enlist help</p>
<p>“Everybody should have alliances at work—peers and people above and
below, who can be your advocates and champions,” says Woodward. Talk to
those supporters and see what they can do to help, whether it’s simply
confirming your perspective or speaking on your behalf. Of course, you
may need to escalate the situation to someone more senior or to HR. But
before that, “you owe it to the relationship to try to solve it
informally,” says Woodward.</p>
<p>Demonstrate the cost to the business</p>
<p>If you do need to take formal action, start with your boss (assuming
he isn’t the aggressor). But you may need to take the issue higher up
the hierarchy. When you have someone’s ear, Namie recommends focusing
the conversation on how the person’s behavior is hurting the business.
“Talk about how it’s affecting morale and performance,” says Fast.
Personal pleas rarely work and too often degenerate into he said-she
said type arguments. “Don’t tell a story of emotional wounds,” Namie
advises. “Make an argument that the person is costing the organization
money.”</p>
<p>Know the limitations</p>
<p>When none of the above works you have to consider: Is this uncivil,
mean behavior, or am I being bullied? If you are in an abusive situation
(not just a tough one), Namie and Woodward agree that chances of change
are low. “The only time I’ve seen a bully change is when they are
publicly fired. Sanctions don’t work,” says Woodward. Instead, you need
to take action to protect yourself. Of course, in an ideal world, senior
leaders would immediately fire people who are toxic to a workplace. But
both Namie and Woodward agree that it rarely happens. “Even though the
statistics are clear on the impact [of bullying] on morale, retention,
and performance, it’s very hard for organizations to take action,”
Woodward says. If you’re in an abusive situation at work, the most
tenable solution may be to leave—if that’s a possibility. The Workplace
Bullying Institute has done online surveys that show more people stay in
a bullying situation because of pride (40% of respondents) than because
of economics (38%). If you’re worried about letting the bully win, Namie
says, you’re better off worrying about your own well-being.2</p>
<p>Principles to remember</p>
<p>Do:</p>
<p>Know that most people act aggressively at work because they feel
threatened.</p>
<p>Ask yourself whether you’re being overly sensitive or misinterpreting
the situation.</p>
<p>Call out the inappropriate behavior in the moment.</p>
<p>Don’t:</p>
<p>Take the blame. Many bullies pick targets that are highly skilled and
well-liked.</p>
<p>Escalate the situation until you’ve tried to solve it informally and
with the help of your allies.</p>
<p>Suffer unnecessarily. If the situation persists and you can leave, do
it.</p>
<p>Case study #1: Don’t stay and suffer</p>
<p>Eleven years ago Heather Reynolds took a new position at a veterinary
clinic owned by another veterinarian named Adam with the intention of
buying into the practice (names and details in these case studies have
been changed). At first, Adam seemed thrilled about Heather coming to
work with him. “He was positive, supportive, and encouraging. He was
over the moon about me joining,” she says. After several months, she
bought half of the firm and became Adam’s business partner.</p>
<p>Things continued to go well until a year later when, after what
seemed like a minor disagreement, Adam stopped speaking to Heather for
six weeks. When she confronted him, he told her he was considering
dropping her as a partner. Heather was shocked. She had taken out a loan
to buy into the firm and felt stuck.</p>
<p>Eventually they got back on track, but Heather soon learned that this
was a pattern of behavior. Any time there was conflict, Adam reacted the
same way. “If I disagreed, he would ice me out. If I confronted him,
he’d ice me out longer,” she says. She eventually figured out that
stroking his ego was more effective. “You could flatter him, tell him
how great he was, how he did well in a case, and he’d be back on your
side. I learned to do this sort of dance in order to survive.”</p>
<p>But Adam’s harsh behavior took its toll on Heather. Last year, things
got so bad that he didn’t speak to her for three months. Heather sought
the advice of a professional coach, who helped her see that Adam was a
narcissist and a bully who was threatened by her skills. Late last year,
she told him she was looking for someone to buy out her part of the
business and he offered to do it. “It was the best thing I could’ve
done,” she says. “I wished I’d left when he first showed me who he truly
was.”</p>
<p>Case study #2: Call out the bad behavior</p>
<p>Christine Johnson was excited about her new role as deputy editor at
a San Francisco–based media company. The position had just been created,
so she would be managing a team of existing staff, and every one
welcomed her except for one person, Terry. “What I didn’t know and I
learned later was that he wanted the role and was angry that he didn’t
get it,” she says.</p>
<p>During her first weeks on the job, Terry was aggressive. “I was
constantly fending off little attacks from him,” she remembers. He kept
asking her how she wanted to supervise their work, what processes she
wanted to put in place, how he should interact with her about his
projects. Looking back, Heather realizes these were all questions
designed to make her look unprepared and incompetent. “And I was too
green to say I didn’t know yet,” she says.</p>
<p>Terry started sending Christine 50 emails with return receipt before
9:00 a.m. When she hadn’t responded by 11:00 a.m., he would start
emailing her to ask if she’d seen his emails. “He was constantly
badgering me. I actually considered quitting. I didn’t feel like I had
any allies and wasn’t sure this was the job I wanted,” she says. After
five weeks of this abuse, Christine stood up to Terry in a staff
meeting. “He kept asking me questions over and over, and I just lost my
cool,” she says. She snapped at Terry and said, “I’m sick of you asking
me so many unnecessary questions. Can you please stop?” Terry backed
down.</p>
<p>Christine was embarrassed by her behavior, but later, when she was in
her office, people began stopping by to thank her for standing up to
Terry. “Once I had a small amount of reinforcement from my peers, I knew
I could take him on,” she says. And once he saw that she wasn’t willing
to take his abuse, he stood down. “It got better and we were cordial,
but it was an awful start,” she says.</p>
