<h4 id="connect-then-lead">4 Connect, Then Lead</h4>
<p>By Amy J. C. Cuddy, Matthew Kohut, and John Neffinger</p>
<p>Is it better to be loved or feared?</p>
<p>Niccolò Machiavelli pondered that timeless conundrum 500 years ago
and hedged his bets. “It may be answered that one should wish to be
both,” he acknowledged, “but because it is difficult to unite them in
one person, it is much safer to be feared than loved.”</p>
<p>Now behavioral science is weighing in with research showing that
Machiavelli had it partly right. When we judge others—especially our
leaders—we look first at two characteristics: how lovable they are
(their warmth, communion, or trustworthiness) and how fearsome they are
(their strength, agency, or competence). Although there is some
disagreement about the proper labels for the traits, researchers agree
that they are the two primary dimensions of social judgment.</p>
<p>Why are these traits so important? Because they answer two critical
questions: “What are this person’s intentions toward me?” and “Is he or
she capable of acting on those intentions?” Together, these assessments
underlie our emotional and behavioral reactions to other people, groups,
and even brands and companies.1 Research by one of us, Amy Cuddy, and
colleagues Susan Fiske of Princeton and Peter Glick of Lawrence
University, shows that people judged to be competent but lacking in
warmth often elicit envy in others, an emotion involving both respect
and resentment that cuts both ways. When we respect someone, we want to
cooperate or affiliate ourselves with him or her, but resentment can
make that person vulnerable to harsh reprisal (think of disgraced Tyco
CEO Dennis Kozlowski, whose extravagance made him an unsympathetic
public figure). On the other hand, people judged as warm but incompetent
tend to elicit pity, which also involves a mix of emotions: Compassion
moves us to help those we pity, but our lack of respect leads us
ultimately to neglect them (think of workers who become marginalized as
they near retirement or of an employee with outmoded skills in a rapidly
evolving industry).</p>
<p>To be sure, we notice plenty of other traits in people, but they’re
nowhere near as influential as warmth and strength. Indeed, insights
from the field of psychology show that these two dimensions account for
more than 90% of the variance in our positive or negative impressions we
form of the people around us.</p>
<p>So which is better, being lovable or being strong? Most leaders today
tend to emphasize their strength, competence, and credentials in the
workplace, but that is exactly the wrong approach. Leaders who project
strength before establishing trust run the risk of eliciting fear, and
along with it, a host of dysfunctional behaviors. Fear can undermine
cognitive potential, creativity, and problem solving, and cause
employees to get stuck and even disengage. It’s a “hot” emotion, with
long-lasting effects. It burns into our memory in a way that cooler
emotions don’t. Research by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman drives this
point home: In a study of 51,836 leaders, only 27 of them were rated in
the bottom quartile in terms of likability and in the top quartile in
terms of overall leadership effectiveness—in other words, the chances
that a manager who is strongly disliked will be considered a good leader
are only about one in 2,000.</p>
<p>A growing body of research suggests that the way to influence—and to
lead—is to begin with warmth. Warmth is the conduit of influence: It
facilitates trust and the communication and absorption of ideas. Even a
few small nonverbal signals—a nod, a smile, an open gesture—can show
people that you’re pleased to be in their company and attentive to their
concerns. Prioritizing warmth helps you connect immediately with those
around you, demonstrating that you hear them, understand them, and can
be trusted by them.</p>
<p>When strength comes first</p>
<p>Most of us work hard to demonstrate our competence. We want to see
ourselves as strong—and want others to see us the same way. We focus on
warding off challenges to our strength and providing abundant evidence
of competence. We feel compelled to demonstrate that we’re up to the
job, by striving to present the most innovative ideas in meetings, being
the first to tackle a challenge, and working the longest hours. We’re
sure of our own intentions and thus don’t feel the need to prove that
we’re trustworthy, despite the fact that evidence of trustworthiness is
the first thing we look for in others.</p>
<p>Organizational psychologists Andrea Abele of the University of
Erlangen-Nuremberg and Bogdan Wojciszke of the University of Gdańsk have
documented this phenomenon across a variety of settings. In one
experiment, when asked to choose between training programs focusing on
competence-related skills (such as time management) and warmth-related
ones (providing social support, for instance), most participants opted
for competence-based training for themselves but soft-skills training
for others. In another experiment, in which participants were asked to
describe an event that shaped their self-image, most told stories about
themselves that emphasized their own competence and self-determination
(“I passed my pilot’s license test on the first try”), whereas when they
described a similar event for someone else, they focused on that
person’s warmth and generosity (“My friend tutored his neighbor’s child
in math and refused to accept any payment”).</p>
<p>But putting competence first undermines leadership: Without a
foundation of trust, people in the organization may comply outwardly
with a leader’s wishes, but they’re much less likely to conform
privately—to adopt the values, culture, and mission of the organization
in a sincere, lasting way. Workplaces lacking in trust often have a
culture of “every employee for himself,” in which people feel that they
must be vigilant about protecting their interests. Employees can become
reluctant to help others because they’re unsure of whether their efforts
will be reciprocated or recognized. The result: Shared organizational
resources fall victim to the tragedy of the commons.</p>
<p>When warmth comes first</p>
<p>Although most of us strive to demonstrate our strength, warmth
contributes significantly more to others’ evaluations of us, and it’s
judged before competence. Princeton social psychologist Alex Todorov and
colleagues study the cognitive and neural mechanisms that drive our
“spontaneous trait inferences”—the snap judgments we make when briefly
looking at faces. Their research shows that when making those judgments,
people consistently pick up on warmth faster than on competence. This
preference for warmth holds true in other areas as well. In a study led
by Oscar Ybarra of the University of Michigan, participants playing a
word game identified warmth-related words (such as “friendly”)
significantly faster than competence-related ones (such as
“skillful”).</p>
<p>Behavioral economists, for their part, have shown that judgments of
trustworthiness generally lead to significantly higher economic gains.
For example, Mascha van ’t Wout of Brown University and Alan Sanfey of
the University of Arizona asked subjects to determine how an endowment
should be allocated. Players invested more money, with no guarantee of
return, in partners whom they perceived to be more trustworthy on the
basis of a glance at their faces.2</p>
<p>In management settings, trust increases information sharing,
openness, fluidity, and cooperation. If coworkers can be trusted to do
the right thing and live up to their commitments, planning,
coordination, and execution are much easier. Trust also facilitates the
exchange and acceptance of ideas—it allows people to hear others’
messages—and boosts the quantity and quality of the ideas that are
produced within an organization. Most important, trust provides the
opportunity to change people’s attitudes and beliefs, not just their
outward behavior. That’s the sweet spot when it comes to influence and
the ability to get people to fully accept your message.</p>
<p>The happy warrior</p>
<p>The best way to gain influence is to combine warmth and strength—as
difficult as Machiavelli says that may be to do. The traits can actually
be mutually reinforcing: Feeling a sense of personal strength helps us
to be more open, less threatened, and less threatening in stressful
situations. When we feel confident and calm, we project authenticity and
warmth.</p>
<p>HOW WILL PEOPLE REACT TO YOUR STYLE?</p>
<p>Research by Amy Cuddy, Susan Fiske, and Peter Glick suggests that the
way others perceive your levels of warmth and competence determines the
emotions you’ll elicit and your ability to influence a situation. For
example, if you’re highly competent but show only moderate warmth,
you’ll get people to go along with you, but you won’t earn their true
engagement and support. And if you show no warmth, beware of those who
may try to derail your efforts—and maybe your career.</p>
<p>Understanding a little bit about our chemical makeup can shed some
light on how this works. The neuropeptides oxytocin and arginine
vasopressin, for instance, have been linked to our ability to form human
attachments, to feel and express warmth, and to behave altruistically.
Recent research also suggests that, across the animal kingdom, feelings
of strength and power have close ties to two hormones: testosterone
(associated with assertiveness, reduced fear, and willingness to compete
and take risks) and cortisol (associated with stress and stress
reactivity).</p>
<p>One study, by Jennifer Lerner, Gary Sherman, Amy Cuddy, and
colleagues, brought hundreds of people participating in Harvard
executive-education programs into the lab and compared their levels of
cortisol with the average levels of the general population. The leaders
reported less stress and anxiety than did the general population, and
their physiology backed that up: Their cortisol levels were
significantly lower. Moreover, the higher their rank and the more sub
ordinates they managed, the lower their cortisol lev els. Why? Most
likely because the leaders had a heightened sense of control—a
psychological factor known to have a powerful stress-buffering effect.
According to research by Pranjal Mehta of the University of Oregon and
Robert Josephs of the University of Texas, the most effective leaders,
regardless of gender, have a unique physiological profile, with
relatively high testosterone and relatively low cortisol.</p>
<p>Such leaders face troubles without being troubled. Their behavior is
not relaxed, but they are relaxed emotionally. They’re often viewed as
“happy warriors,” and the effect of their demeanor on those around them
is compelling. Happy warriors reassure us that whatever challenges we
may face, things will work out in the end. Ann Richards, the former
governor of Texas, played the happy warrior by pairing her assertiveness
and authority with a big smile and a quick wit that made it clear she
did not let the rough-and-tumble world of politics get her down.</p>
<p>During crises, these are the people who are able to keep that
influence conduit open and may even expand it. Most people hate
uncertainty, but they tolerate it much better when they can look to a
leader who they believe has their back and is calm, clearheaded, and
courageous. These are the people we trust. These are the people we
listen to.</p>
<p>There are physical exercises that can help to summon
self-confidence—and even alter your body’s chemistry to be more like
that of a happy warrior. Dana Carney, Amy Cuddy, and Andy Yap suggest
that people adopt “power poses” associated with dominance and strength
across the animal kingdom. These postures are open, expansive, and
space-occupying (imagine Wonder Woman and Superman standing tall with
their hands on their hips and feet spread apart). By adopting these
postures for just two minutes before social encounters, their research
shows, participants significantly increased their testosterone and
decreased their cortisol levels.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the signals we send can be ambiguous—we can see
someone’s reaction to our presence, but we may not be sure exactly what
the person is reacting to. We may feel a leader’s warmth but remain
unsure whether it is directed at us; we sense her strength but need
reassurance that it is squarely aimed at the shared challenge we face.
And, as we noted earlier, judgments are often made quickly, on the basis
of nonverbal cues. Especially when facing a high-pressure situation, it
is useful for leaders to go through a brief warm-up routine beforehand
to get in the right state of mind, practicing and adopting an attitude
that will help them project positive nonverbal signals. We refer to this
approach as “inside out,” in contrast to the “outside-in” strategy of
trying to consciously execute specific nonverbal behaviors in the
moment. Think of the difference between method acting and classical
acting: In method acting, the actor experiences the emotions of the
character and naturally produces an authentic performance, whereas in
classical acting, actors learn to exercise precise control of their
nonverbal signals. Generally speaking, an inside-out approach is more
effective.</p>
<p>There are many tactics for projecting warmth and competence, and
these can be dialed up or down as needed. Two of us, John Neffinger and
Matt Kohut, work with leaders from many walks of life in mastering both
nonverbal and verbal cues. Let’s look now at some best practices.</p>
<p>WHY WARMTH TRUMPS STRENGTH</p>
<p>The primacy of warmth manifests in many interrelated ways that
powerfully underscore the importance of connecting with people before
trying to lead them.</p>
<p>The Need to Affiliate</p>
<p>People have a need to be included, to feel a sense of belonging. In
fact, some psychologists would argue that the drive to affiliate ranks
among our primary needs as humans. Experiments by neuroscientist Naomi
Eisenberger and colleagues suggest that the need is so strong that when
we are ostracized—even by virtual strangers—we experience pain that is
akin to strong physical pain.</p>
<p>“Us” Versus “Them”</p>
<p>In recent decades, few areas have received as much attention from
social psychology researchers as group dynamics, and for good reason:
The preference for the groups to which one belongs is so strong that
even under extreme conditions—such as knowing that membership in a group
was randomly assigned and that the groups themselves are
arbitrary—people consistently prefer fellow group members to nonmembers.
As a leader, you must make sure you’re a part of the key groups in your
organization. In fact, you want to be the aspirational member of the
group, the chosen representative of the group. As soon as you become one
of “them”—the management, the leadership—you begin to lose people.</p>
<p>The Desire to Be Understood</p>
<p>People deeply desire to be heard and seen. Sadly, as important as
perspective taking is to good leadership, being in a position of power
decreases people’s understanding of others’ points of view. When we have
power over others, our ability to see them as individuals diminishes. So
leaders need to consciously and consistently make the effort to imagine
walking in the shoes of the people they are leading.</p>
<p>How to project warmth</p>
<p>Efforts to appear warm and trustworthy by consciously controlling
your nonverbal signals can back-fire: All too often, you’ll come off as
wooden and inauthentic instead. Here are ways to avoid that trap.</p>
<p>Find the right level</p>
<p>When people want to project warmth, they sometimes amp up the
enthusiasm in their voice, increasing their volume and dynamic range to
convey delight. That can be effective in the right setting, but if those
around you have done nothing in particular to earn your adulation,
they’ll assume either that you’re faking it or that you fawn over
everyone indiscriminately.</p>
<p>A better way to create vocal warmth is to speak with lower pitch and
volume, as you would if you were comforting a friend. Aim for a tone
that suggests that you’re leveling with people—that you’re sharing the
straight scoop, with no pretense or emotional adornment. In doing so,
you signal that you trust those you’re talking with to handle things the
right way. You might even occasionally share a personal story—one that
feels private but not inappropriate—in a confiding tone of voice to
demonstrate that you’re being forthcoming and open. Suppose, for
instance, that you want to establish a bond with new employees you’re
meeting for the first time. You might offer something personal right off
the bat, such as recalling how you felt at a similar point in your
career. That’s often enough to set a congenial tone.</p>
<p>Validate feelings</p>
<p>Before people decide what they think of your message, they decide
what they think of you. If you show your employees that you hold roughly
the same worldview they do, you demonstrate not only empathy but, in
their eyes, common sense—the ultimate qualification for being listened
to. So if you want colleagues to listen and agree with you, first agree
with them.</p>
<p>Imagine, for instance, that your company is undergoing a major
reorganization and your group is feeling deep anxiety over what the
change could mean—for quality, innovation, job security. Acknowledge
people’s fear and concerns when you speak to them, whether in formal
meetings or during water-cooler chats. Look them in the eye and say, “I
know everybody’s feeling a lot of uncertainty right now, and it’s
unsettling.” People will respect you for addressing the elephant in the
room, and will be more open to hearing what you have to say.</p>
<p>ARE YOU PROJECTING WARMTH?</p>
<p>How you present yourself in workplace settings matters a great deal
to how you’re perceived by others. Even if you’re not feeling
particularly warm, practicing these approaches and using them in formal
and informal situations can help clear your path to influence.</p>
<p>Warm</p>
<p>When standing, balance your weight primarily on one hip to avoid
appearing rigid or tense.</p>
<p>Tilt your head slightly and keep your hands open and welcoming.</p>
<p>Cold</p>
<p>Avoid standing with your chin pointed down.</p>
<p>Don’t pivot your body away from the person you’re engaging with.</p>
<p>Avoid closed-hand positions and cutting motions.</p>
<p>Warm</p>
<p>Lean inward in a nonaggressive manner to signal interest and
engagement.</p>
<p>Place your hands comfortably on your knees or rest them on the
table.</p>
<p>Aim for body language that feels professional but relaxed.</p>
<p>Cold</p>
<p>Try not to angle your body away from the person you’re engaging.</p>
<p>Crossing your arms indicates coldness and a lack of receptivity.</p>
<p>Avoid sitting “at attention” or in an aggressive posture.</p>
<p>Illustration: Colin Hayes</p>
<p>Smile—and mean it</p>
<p>When we smile sincerely, the warmth becomes self-reinforcing: Feeling
happy makes us smile, and smiling makes us happy. This facial feedback
is also contagious. We tend to mirror one another’s nonverbal
expressions and emotions, so when we see someone beaming and emanating
genuine warmth, we can’t resist smiling ourselves.</p>
<p>Warmth is not easy to fake, of course, and a polite smile fools no
one. To project warmth, you have to genuinely feel it. A natural smile,
for instance, involves not only the muscles around the mouth but also
those around the eyes—the crow’s feet.</p>
<p>So how do you produce a natural smile? Find some reason to feel happy
wherever you may be, even if you have to resort to laughing at your
predicament. Introverts in social settings can single out one person to
focus on. This can help you channel the sense of comfort you feel with
close friends or family.</p>
<p>For example, KNP Communications worked with a manager who was having
trouble connecting with her employees. Having come up through the ranks
as a highly analytic engineer, she projected competence and
determination, but not much warmth. We noticed, however, that when she
talked about where she grew up and what she learned about life from the
tight-knit community in her neighborhood, her demeanor relaxed and she
smiled broadly. By including a brief anecdote about her upbringing when
she kicked off a meeting or made a presentation, she was able to show
her colleagues a warm and relatable side of herself.</p>
<p>One thing to avoid: smiling with your eyebrows raised at anyone over
the age of five. This suggests that you are overly eager to please and
be liked. It also signals anxiety, which, like warmth, is contagious. It
will cost you much more in strength than you will gain in warmth.</p>
<p>How to project strength</p>
<p>Strength or competence can be established by virtue of the position
you hold, your reputation, and your actual performance. But your
presence, or demeanor, always counts, too. The way you carry yourself
doesn’t establish your skill level, of course, but it is taken as strong
evidence of your attitude—how serious you are and how determined to
tackle a challenge—and that is an important component of overall
strength. The trick is to cultivate a demeanor of strength without
seeming menacing.</p>
<p>Feel in command</p>
<p>Warmth may be harder to fake, but confidence is harder to talk
yourself into. Feeling like an impostor—that you don’t belong in the
position you’re in and are going to be “found out”—is very common. But
self-doubt completely undermines your ability to project confidence,
enthusiasm, and passion, the qualities that make up presence. In fact,
if you see yourself as an impostor, others will, too. Feeling in command
and confident is about connecting with yourself. And when we are
connected with ourselves, it is much easier to connect with others.</p>
<p>Holding your body in certain ways, as we discussed previously, can
help. Although we refer to these postures as power poses, they don’t
increase your dominance over others. They’re about personal power—your
agency and ability to self-regulate. Recent research led by Dacher
Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley, shows that feeling
powerful in this way allows you to shed the fears and inhibitions that
can prevent you from bringing your fullest, most authentic and
enthusiastic self to a high-stakes professional situation, such as a
pitch to investors or a speech to an influential audience.</p>
<p>Stand up straight</p>
<p>It is hard to overstate the importance of good posture in projecting
authority and an intention to be taken seriously. As Maya Angelou wrote,
“Stand up straight and realize who you are, that you tower over your
circumstances.” Good posture does not mean the exaggerated chest-out
pose known in the military as standing at attention, or raising one’s
chin up high. It just means reaching your full height, using your
muscles to straighten the S-curve in your spine rather than slouching.
It sounds trivial, but maximizing the physical space your body takes up
makes a substantial difference in how your audience reacts to you,
regardless of your height.</p>
<p>Get ahold of yourself</p>
<p>When you move, move deliberately and precisely to a specific spot
rather than casting your limbs about loose-jointedly. And when you are
finished moving, be still. Twitching, fidgeting, or other visual static
sends the signal that you’re not in control. Stillness demonstrates
calm. Combine that with good posture, and you’ll achieve what’s known as
poise, which telegraphs equilibrium and stability, important aspects of
credible leadership presence.</p>
<p>Standing tall is an especially good way to project strength because
it doesn’t interfere with warmth in the way that other signals of
strength—cutting gestures, a furrowed brow, an elevated chin—often do.
People who instruct their children to stand up straight and smile are on
to something: This simple combination is perhaps the best way to project
strength and warmth simultaneously. If you want to effectively lead
others, you have to get the warmth-competence dynamic right. Projecting
both traits at once is difficult, but the two can be mutually
reinforcing—and the rewards substantial. Earning the trust and
appreciation of those around you feels good. Feeling in command of a
situation does, too. Doing both lets you influence people more
effectively.</p>
<p>The strategies we suggest may seem awkward at first, but they will
soon create a positive feedback loop. Being calm and confident creates
space to be warm, open, and appreciative, to choose to act in ways that
reflect and express your values and priorities. Once you establish your
warmth, your strength is received as a welcome reassurance. Your
leadership becomes not a threat but a gift.</p>
