to Find Meaning in a Job That Isn’t Your True Calling</h4>
<p>By Emily Esfahani Smith</p>
<p>Why do so few people find fulfillment in their work?</p>
<p>A few years ago I posed this question to Amy Wrzesniewski, a Yale
School of Management professor who studies these issues, and she offered
an explanation that made a lot of sense. Students, she told me, “think
their calling is under a rock, and if they turn over enough rocks, they
will find it.”</p>
<p>Surveys confirm that meaning is the top thing millennials say they
want from a job. And yet her research shows that less than 50% of people
see their work as a calling. So many of her students are left feeling
anxious and frustrated and completely unsatisfied by the good jobs and
careers they do secure.1</p>
<p>What they—and many of us, I think—fail to realize is that work can be
meaningful even if you don’t think of it as a calling. The four most
common occupations in America are retail salesperson, cashier, food
preparer or server, and office clerk—jobs that aren’t typically
associated with meaning.2 But all have something in common with roles
that are considered meaningful, such as clergy, teachers, and doctors:
They exist to help others. And as Adam Grant, an organizational
psychologist and professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton
School, has shown, people who see their work as a form of giving
consistently rank their jobs as more meaningful.3</p>
<p>That means you can find meaning in nearly any role in nearly any
organization. After all, most companies create products or services to
fill a need in the world, and all employees contribute in their own way.
The key is to become more conscious about the service you’re
providing—as a whole and personally.</p>
<p>How? One way is to connect with the end user or beneficiary. In one
study, Grant and his colleagues found that fundraisers in a university
call center who’d been introduced to a student whose education was being
paid for by the money raised spent 142% more time on the phone with
potential donors and raised 171% more cash than peers who hadn’t met
those scholarship recipients. Whether your customers are external or
internal, an increased focus on them, and how you help them live their
lives or do their jobs, can help you find more meaning in yours.</p>
<p>Another strategy is to constantly remind yourself of your
organization’s overarching goal. There’s a great story about a janitor
that John F. Kennedy ran into at NASA in 1962. When the president asked
him what he was doing, the man said, “I’m helping put a man on the
moon.” Life is Good is an apparel company best known for colorful
T-shirts with stick-figure designs, but its mission is to spread
optimism and hope throughout the world, and that’s something that even
the company’s warehouse employees under stand. If you work for an
accounting firm, you’re helping people or companies with the unpleasant
task of doing their taxes. If you’re a fast-food cook, you’re providing
a family with a cheap and delicious meal. Each of these jobs serves a
purpose in the world.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t get excited about your company’s mission or
customers, you can still adopt a service mindset by thinking about how
your work helps those you love. Consider a study of women working in a
coupon-processing factory in Mexico. Researchers led by Jochen Menges, a
professor of leadership and organizational behavior at WHU–Otto Beisheim
School of Management, found that those who described the work as dull
were generally less productive than those who said it was rewarding. But
the effects went away for those in the former group who saw the work
(however tedious) as a way to support their families. With that
attitude, they were just as productive and energized as the coupon
processors who didn’t mind the task. Many people understand the purpose
of their jobs in a similar manner. The work they do helps them pay their
mortgage, go on vacation—or even support a hobby that gives meaning to
their lives, like volunteer tutoring, gardening, or woodworking.</p>
<p>Not everyone finds their one true calling. But that doesn’t mean
we’re doomed to work meaningless jobs. If we reframe our tasks as
opportunities to help others, any occupation can feel more
significant.</p>

meaning in local communities.</p>
