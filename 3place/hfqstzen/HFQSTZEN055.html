<h4 id="how-to-manage-someone-who-thinks-everything-is-urgent">7 How to
Manage Someone Who Thinks Everything Is Urgent</h4>
<p>By Liz Kislik</p>
<p>We’ve all been in situations where we couldn’t wait for a slow-moving
or overly cautious employee to take action. But at the other extreme,
some employees have such a deep need to get things resolved that they
move too quickly, or too intensely, and make a mess. They may make a bad
deal just to say they’ve made it or issue a directive without thinking
through the ramifications just to say they’ve handled a problem
decisively.</p>
<p>The problem is that these employees may have been praised in the past
for this very behavior, even when it results in mistakes that they can
then heroically “save.” And when urgency is a part of the organizational
culture, it may feel like a requirement to move fast, whether you’re a
leader or a frontline employee. At a basic level, because urgency
generates so much activity, it can be hard to recognize it as an
organizational problem. But it’s a significant one. Executives report
that thousands of dollars are lost every business day when decisions are
rote or arbitrary because of pro forma, nonstrategic decision
making.</p>
<p>And yet, despite the damage that unaddressed urgency can do, urgent
employees are usually some of the most committed and are often very
productive. Here are steps you can take to mitigate the negative impact
of their urgency, to help them focus their intensity on the right
targets, and to ensure they make better long-term decisions before
taking action.</p>
<p>Help them recognize their impact on others. Show your urgent
employees how collaboration pays off for every one—including them. One
assistant VP I worked with was correct about what needed to be
accomplished, but he was driven to get it over with and put it behind
him and often operated unilaterally to get things done. Because he was
only urgent about his own goals and tasks, he was perceived as a bad
partner and not a team player. I encouraged his manager to affirm the
importance of collaboration and to ask him to prepare the equivalent of
“impact statements” as a way to force interaction and cooperation with
other parties. His manager also learned to stop praising him for every
accomplishment and to praise him instead for the process: joint
planning, coordination, and interdepartmental success.</p>
<p>Encourage them to identify all the consequences of their actions.
It’s typical for urgent employees to see only the upside of acting
quickly, not the negative effects of acting too quickly. A VP at a
nonprofit client had a history of making decisions hastily and without
sufficient data. These decisions led to some unfortunate employee
layoffs, even though she had been asked to consult with others and weigh
such decisions carefully. After we had her rehearse termination
conversations with the employees she had just hired, we dramatized the
impact the firings would have on them as individuals and on their
families. The exposure to the pain she was causing finally got her
attention.</p>
<p>Pair them with long-term thinkers. Effective interventions let urgent
employees actually experience the success that comes from a more
deliberate, thoughtful approach. A senior sales specialist brought in
many deals because he was both diligent and intense. But he was so eager
to get the deals that as soon as a prospect indicated even a tentative
yes, he would offer anything they seemed to want to close their initial
order rather than strengthening his own presentation to get better
value. After he brought in several new accounts that were significantly
smaller than potential or that had too many strings attached, his
management paired him with a more cerebral colleague who excelled in
research and planning. The combination of high energy and careful
planning increased the number and size of deals.</p>
<p>Coach them to separate urgency from what actually needs to be done.
Addressing underlying concerns often mitigates the apparent need for
urgency. During a period of organizational growth, a previously solid
team leader made people nuts because he seemed to not take others’
input, needed to manage everything himself, and didn’t share enough
information or decision making with his team. His team’s growth and
development was suppressed, and he was almost always overwhelmed and
holding up progress. We discussed various aspects of project management
so that he could see he had all the elements under control, and then I
asked, “What’s the actual pressure?” After some discussion, it became
clear that the pressure wasn’t from the work itself so much as from
feeling alone with the awesome responsibility of handling it all. We
used mindfulness techniques to help him cope with the feeling and
various other techniques for engaging his team so that they understood
the ramifications, how to anticipate, how to shoulder more
responsibility, and how to warn him if anything was going off
course.</p>
<p>Employees who are driven by excessive urgency often act like they’re
scratching an itch rather than making intentional efforts to accomplish
and grow as much as they can, either for themselves or their
organizations. Once they realize that additional reflection and
deliberation can generate significantly better results, they can learn
to corral their urgency in service of being a better leader and
achieving better performance.</p>
<p>LIZ KISLIK has helped organizations from the Fortune 500 to national
nonprofits and family-run businesses—such as American Express, the
American Red Cross, Staples, and Highlights for Children—solve their
biggest challenges in organizational performance, talent management, and
leadership development while strengthening their top and bottom lines in
the process. She has served as adjunct faculty at Hofstra University and
New York University, and speaks frequently on the topics of
collaboration, managing teams, developing leaders, and improving
customer loyalty.</p>
