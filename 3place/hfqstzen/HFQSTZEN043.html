It’s Harder to Empathize with People If You’ve Been in Their Shoes</h4>
<p>By Rachel Ruttan, Mary-Hunter McDonnell, and Loran Nordgren</p>
<p>Imagine that you have just become a new parent. Overwhelmed and
exhausted, your performance at work is suffering. You desperately want
to work from home part time to devote more attention to your family. One
of your supervisors has had children while climbing the corporate
ladder, while the other hasn’t. Which supervisor is more likely to
embrace your request?</p>
<p>Most people would recommend approaching the supervisor who has
children, drawing on the intuition that shared experience breeds
empathy. After all, she has “been there” and thus would seem best placed
to understand your situation.</p>
<p>Our recent research suggests that this instinct is very often
wrong.1</p>
<p>In a series of recent experiments, we found that people who have
endured challenges in the past (like divorce or being skipped over for a
promotion) were less likely to show compassion for someone facing the
same struggle, compared with people with no experience in that
particular situation.</p>
<p>In the first experiment, we surveyed people participating in a “polar
plunge”: a jump into a very icy Lake Michigan in March. All participants
read a story about a man named Pat who intended to complete the plunge
but chickened out and withdrew from the event at the last minute.
Critically, participants read about Pat either before they had completed
the plunge themselves or one week after. We found that polar plungers
who had successfully completed the plunge were less compassionate and
more contemptuous of Pat than were those who had not yet completed the
plunge.</p>
<p>In another study, we looked at compassion toward an individual
struggling with unemployment. More than 200 people read a story about a
man who—despite his best efforts—is unable to find a job. Struggling to
make ends meet, the man ultimately stoops to selling drugs in order to
earn money. We found that people who had overcome a period of
unemployment in the past were less compassionate and more judgmental of
the man than people who were currently unemployed or had never been
involuntarily unemployed.</p>
<p>A third study examined compassion toward a bullied teenager.
Participants were told either that the teen was successfully coping with
the bullying or that he failed to cope by lashing out violently.
Compared with participants who had no experience with bullying,
participants who reported having been bullied in the past themselves
were more compassionate toward the teen who was appropriately coping
with the experience. But, as in our earlier studies, participants who
were bullied in the past were the least compassionate toward the teen
who failed to successfully cope with the bullying.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that people who have endured a
difficult experience are particularly likely to penalize those who
struggle to cope with a similar ordeal.</p>
<p>But why does this occur? We suggest that this phenomenon is rooted in
two psychological truths.</p>
<p>First, people generally have difficulty accurately recalling just how
difficult a past aversive experience was. Though we may remember that a
past experience was painful, stressful, or emotionally trying, we tend
to underestimate just how painful that experience felt in the moment.
This phenomenon is called an “empathy gap.”2</p>
<p>Second, people who have previously overcome an aversive experience
know that they were able to successfully overcome it, which makes them
feel especially confident about their understanding of just how
difficult the situation is. The combined experience of “I can’t recall
how difficult it was” and “I know that I got through it myself” creates
the perception that the event can be readily conquered, reducing empathy
toward others struggling with the event.</p>
<p>This finding seems to run counter to our intuitions. When we asked
participants to predict who would show the most compassion for the
bullied teenager, for instance—a teacher who’d endured bullying himself
or one who never had—an overwhelming 99 out of the 112 people chose the
teacher who had been bullied. This means that many people may be
instinctively seeking compassion from the very people who are least
likely to provide it.</p>
<p>This clearly has implications for peer-to-peer office communication
(choose the person you vent to carefully). And mentorship programs,
which often pair people from similar backgrounds or experiences, may
need to be reexamined. But there are also important lessons for leaders.
When approached by employees in distress, leaders may believe that their
own emotional reaction to the issue should guide their response. For
example, an executive who broke the glass ceiling may focus on her own
success when considering an employee’s concerns about discrimination.
Similarly, managers in overworked industries such as consulting and
banking may respond to employees’ concerns about burnout and fatigue
with comments such as, “I had to work those hours, so why are you
complaining?” (And in fact, there is some evidence that this mechanism
is at play when older workers push back on reforms designed to help cut
down on overwork.)3</p>
<p>Simply put, leaders need to get outside of their own heads—to place
less emphasis, not more, on their own past challenges. To bridge the
empathy gap, leaders may be best served by focusing on how upset the
other person seems to be or by reminding themselves that many others
struggle with the same challenge. Returning to the opening example, the
supervisor approached by an exhausted new parent could instead think
about the countless other new parents who struggle to find work-life
balance, many of whom are ultimately pushed out of the workplace.</p>
<p>When we’re trying to encourage someone to be more empathetic, we
often say something like, “walk a mile in his shoes.” As it turns out,
that may be exactly the wrong thing to say to people who have worn those
shoes themselves.</p>
