<h4 id="the-first-component-of-emotional-intelligence">1 The First
Component of Emotional Intelligence</h4>
<p>By Daniel Goleman</p>
<p>Self-awareness is the first component of emotional intelligence—which
makes sense when one considers that the Delphic oracle gave the advice
to “know thyself” thousands of years ago. Self-awareness means having a
deep understanding of one’s emotions, strengths, weaknesses, needs, and
drives. People with strong self-awareness are neither overly critical
nor unrealistically hopeful. Rather, they are honest—with themselves and
with others.</p>
<p>People who have a high degree of self-awareness recognize how their
feelings affect them, other people, and their job performance. Thus, a
self-aware person who knows that tight deadlines bring out the worst in
him plans his time carefully and gets his work done well in advance.
Another person with high self-awareness will be able to work with a
demanding client. She will understand the client’s impact on her moods
and the deeper reasons for her frustration. “Their trivial demands take
us away from the real work that needs to be done,” she might explain.
And she will go one step further and turn her anger into something
constructive.</p>
<p>Self-awareness extends to a person’s understanding of his or her
values and goals. Someone who is highly self-aware knows where he is
headed and why; so, for example, he will be able to be firm in turning
down a job offer that is tempting financially but does not fit with his
principles or long-term goals. A person who lacks self-awareness is apt
to make decisions that bring on inner turmoil by treading on buried
values. “The money looked good so I signed on,” someone might say two
years into a job, “but the work means so little to me that I’m
constantly bored.” The decisions of self-aware people mesh with their
values; consequently, they often find work to be energizing.</p>
<p>How can one recognize self-awareness? First and foremost, it shows
itself as candor and an ability to assess oneself realistically. People
with high self-awareness are able to speak accurately and
openly—although not necessarily effusively or confessionally—about their
emotions and the impact they have on their work. For instance, one
manager I know of was skeptical about a new personal-shopper service
that her company, a major department-store chain, was about to
introduce. Without prompting from her team or her boss, she offered them
an explanation: “It’s hard for me to get behind the rollout of this
service,” she admitted, “because I really wanted to run the project, but
I wasn’t selected. Bear with me while I deal with that.” The manager did
indeed examine her feelings; a week later, she was supporting the
project fully.</p>
<p>Such self-knowledge often shows itself in the hiring process. Ask a
candidate to describe a time he got carried away by his feelings and did
something he later regretted. Self-aware candidates will be frank in
admitting to failure—and will often tell their tales with a smile. One
of the hallmarks of self-awareness is a self-deprecating sense of
humor.</p>
<p>Self-awareness can also be identified during performance reviews.
Self-aware people know—and are comfortable talking about—their
limitations and strengths, and they often demonstrate a thirst for
constructive criticism. By contrast, people with low self-awareness
interpret the message that they need to improve as a threat or a sign of
failure.</p>
<p>Self-aware people can also be recognized by their self-confidence.
They have a firm grasp of their capabilities and are less likely to set
themselves up to fail by, for example, overstretching on assignments.
They know, too, when to ask for help. And the risks they take on the job
are calculated. They won’t ask for a challenge that they know they can’t
handle alone. They’ll play to their strengths.</p>
<p>Consider the actions of a midlevel employee who was invited to sit in
on a strategy meeting with her company’s top executives. Although she
was the most junior person in the room, she did not sit there quietly,
listening in awestruck or fearful silence. She knew she had a head for
clear logic and the skill to present ideas persuasively, and she offered
cogent suggestions about the company’s strategy. At the same time, her
self-awareness stopped her from wandering into territory where she knew
she was weak.</p>
<p>Despite the value of having self-aware people in the workplace, my
research indicates that senior executives don’t often give
self-awareness the credit it deserves when they look for potential
leaders. Many executives mistake candor about feelings for “wimpiness”
and fail to give due respect to employees who openly acknowledge their
shortcomings. Such people are too readily dismissed as “not tough
enough” to lead others.</p>
<p>WHAT MAKES A LEADER?</p>
<p>What distinguishes great leaders from merely good ones? It isn’t IQ
or technical skills, says Daniel Goleman. It’s emotional intelligence: a
group of five skills that enable the best leaders to maximize their own
and their followers’ performance. When senior managers at one company
had a critical mass of emotional intelligence (EI) capabilities, their
divisions outperformed yearly earnings goals by 20%.</p>
<p>The EI skills are:</p>
<p>Self-awareness: knowing one’s strengths, weaknesses, drives, values,
and impact on others</p>
<p>Self-regulation: controlling or redirecting disruptive impulses and
moods</p>
<p>Motivation: relishing achievement for its own sake</p>
<p>Empathy: understanding other people’s emotional makeup</p>
<p>Social skill: building rapport with others to move them in desired
directions</p>
<p>We’re each born with certain levels of EI skills. But we can
strengthen these abilities through persistence, practice, and feedback
from colleagues or coaches.</p>
<p>In fact, the opposite is true. In the first place, people generally
admire and respect candor. Further more, leaders are constantly required
to make judgment calls that require a candid assessment of
capabilities—their own and those of others. Do we have the management
expertise to acquire a competitor? Can we launch a new product within
six months? People who assess themselves honestly—that is, self-aware
people—are well suited to do the same for the organizations they
run.</p>
