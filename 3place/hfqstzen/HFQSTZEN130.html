<h4 id="how-to-think-about-building-your-legacy">12 How to Think About
Building Your Legacy</h4>
<p>By Kimberly Wade-Benzoni</p>
<p>As a leader, leaving a great legacy is arguably the most powerful
thing you can do in your career and life because it enables you to have
influence well into the future—even after you are out of the picture
yourself. It’s key to optimizing your impact on your organization and
its people. Legacy building in business contexts can take the form of
working to ensure the long-term viability of the organization and
leaving it stronger, more productive, and more valuable than it was
before. Or, in more dramatic scenarios led by entrepreneurs, creating an
entirely new organization. Thinking about your legacy is also a great
way to ensure that you are taking into account the long-term perspective
of your organization and resisting the temptation to make myopic
decisions that are overly focused on short-term gain.</p>
<p>So then, how can you keep your legacy in mind as you go about your
everyday decisions? Fortunately, more than a decade of research on how
people make decisions that involve future generations provides some
specific strategies for helping you to keep legacy building in mind and
leverage those thoughts to maximize your impact on the world.1</p>
<p>Think about what the previous generation did for you</p>
<p>Recall your predecessors and how their actions affected you. What
resources did they leave behind for you and your contemporaries? How did
they change the organization to provide you with opportunities? How did
they shape your organization’s culture?</p>
<p>While you can’t always reciprocate the deeds of prior generations
because they are no longer part of the organization, you can pay it
forward by behaving similarly to the next generation of organizational
actors. When you take the long-term perspective and think about your
organization in terms of multiple generations, reciprocity is not
direct, but rather it takes on a more generalized form. Research shows
that when we know we have benefited from the legacy of the prior
generation, that gets us thinking about the positive legacy we want to
leave for future generations and we tend to make better
long-term-oriented decisions.2</p>
<p>Focus on the burdens rather than the benefits</p>
<p>When making decisions about the future, leaders may be allocating
desirable benefits such as profit or natural resources or they may be
distributing burdens that they and others wish to avoid, such as debt or
hazardous waste. Research shows that whether a resource is a benefit or
a burden matters when it comes to allocation decisions and legacies.3
People are more concerned with avoiding leaving a negative legacy than
with creating a positive one. Compared to leaving benefits to future
others, leaving burdens leads individuals to feel a greater sense of
responsibility toward and affinity with those in the future as well as
more moral emotions, such as shame and guilt.</p>
<p>Highlighting the burdensome aspects of long-range decisions can help
leaders to recognize the negative legacies that such choices can create.
Further, it is strategic for organizations to intentionally connect
decisions about benefits and burdens so that managers must make them
simultaneously. The increased focus on ethical considerations that
accompanies the allocation of burdens can help attenuate the
shortsighted and self-interested behavior that often guides the
allocation of benefits.</p>
<p>Consider the responsibility that comes with your power</p>
<p>Most research on power suggests that the experience of power tends to
make people more self-focused and self-interested. This research
primarily considers the effect of power in limited time frames. However,
recent research on intergenerational decisions involving longer time
frames reveals that power can lead decision makers to be more concerned
with the interests of others in the future.4 When intergenerational
decisions are combined with an enhanced experience of power, people feel
more social responsibility and are more focused on their legacy,
compared to when their power is not prominent. The result is that they
are more generous to future generations, which naturally helps them to
build a positive legacy. When it is clear that we are in a position to
determine outcomes for powerless and voiceless others, our decisions are
ethically charged and we consider the moral implications of our actions
more seriously.</p>
<p>Remember that you will die someday</p>
<p>One day in 1888, a wealthy and successful man was reading what was
supposed to be his brother’s obituary in a French newspaper. As he read,
he realized that the editor had confused the two brothers and had
written an obituary for him instead. The headline proclaimed, “The
merchant of death is dead,” and then described a man who had gained his
wealth by helping people to kill one another. Not surprisingly, he was
deeply troubled by this glimpse of what his legacy might have been had
he actually died on that day. It is believed that this incident was
pivotal in motivating him to leave nearly his entire fortune following
his actual death eight years later to fund awards each year to give to
those whose work most benefited humanity. This is, of course, the true
story of Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite and the founder of the
Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Yes, we all die. When we are reminded of our deaths, we remember that
we don’t want to die—we want to live! But we understand death’s
inevitability, and that fact creates an existential dilemma in light of
our deeply rooted survival instinct. One of the most effective things we
can do to buffer our anxiety about death is to attempt to transcend
death by finding meaning in our lives. Central to this meaning is that
we have impact that persists beyond our physical existence.</p>
<p>Research shows that reminding people of death motivates them to
consider their legacy and causes them to act in ways that benefit future
generations, thus improving the overall quality of their long-term
decisions.5 People feel better in the face of death if they are a part
of something that will live on after them. Having a positive impact on
future generations can help fulfill that need. Nobel lives on through
his legacy, and receiving a shocking reminder of the inevitability of
his death helped him to get there. His story also illustrates how
avoiding a negative legacy can be more motivating than simply wanting to
build a positive one.</p>
<p>In sum, the epitome of power is to leave a great legacy that lives on
after you are gone. This is how you can maximize your influence and
ensure you are keeping the long-term success of the organization in
mind. And as a bonus you get a little bit of (symbolic) immortality.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your legacy is all you’ve got. Think about how you want
to be remembered by other people and act on those thoughts. Give the
grim reaper a run for his money by creating something meaningful that
will outlive you.</p>
