<h4 id="mindfulness-in-the-age-of-complexity">1 Mindfulness in the Age
of Complexity</h4>
<p>An interview with Ellen Langer by Alison Beard</p>
<p>Over nearly four decades, Ellen Langer’s research on mindfulness has
greatly influenced thinking across a range of fields, from behavioral
economics to positive psychology. It reveals that by paying attention to
what’s going on around us, instead of operating on autopilot, we can
reduce stress, unlock creativity, and boost performance. Her “counter
clockwise” experiments, for example, demonstrated that elderly men could
improve their health by simply acting as if it were 20 years earlier. In
this interview with senior editor Alison Beard, Langer applies her
thinking to leadership and management in an age of increasing chaos.</p>
<p>HBR: Let’s start with the basics. What, exactly, is mindfulness? How
do you define it?</p>
<p>Langer: Mindfulness is the process of actively noticing new things.
When you do that, it puts you in the present. It makes you more
sensitive to context and perspective. It’s the essence of engagement.
And it’s energy-begetting, not energy-consuming. The mistake most people
make is to assume it’s stressful and exhausting—all this thinking. But
what’s stressful is all the mindless negative evaluations we make and
the worry that we’ll find problems and not be able to solve them.</p>
<p>We all seek stability. We want to hold things still, thinking that if
we do, we can control them. But since everything is always changing,
that doesn’t work. Actually, it causes you to lose control.</p>
<p>Take work processes. When people say, “This is the way to do it,”
that’s not true. There are always many ways, and the way you choose
should depend on the current context. You can’t solve today’s problems
with yesterday’s solutions. So when someone says, “Learn this so it’s
second nature,” let a bell go off in your head, because that means
mindlessness. The rules you were given were the rules that worked for
the person who created them, and the more different you are from that
person, the worse they’re going to work for you. When you’re mindful,
rules, routines, and goals guide you; they don’t govern you.</p>
<p>What are some of the specific benefits of being more mindful,
according to your research?</p>
<p>Better performance, for one. We did a study with symphony musicians,
who, it turns out, are bored to death. They’re playing the same pieces
over and over again, and yet it’s a high-status job that they can’t
easily walk away from. So we had groups of them perform. Some were told
to replicate a previous performance they’d liked—that is, to play pretty
mindlessly. Others were told to make their individual performance new in
subtle ways—to play mindfully. Remember: This wasn’t jazz, so the
changes were very subtle indeed. But when we played recordings of the
symphonies for people who knew nothing about the study, they
overwhelmingly preferred the mindfully played pieces. So here we had a
group performance where everybody was doing their own thing, and it was
better. There’s this view that if you let every one do their own thing,
chaos will reign. When people are doing their own thing in a rebellious
way, yes, it might. But if every one is working in the same context and
is fully present, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t get a superior
coordinated performance.</p>
<p>There are many other advantages to mindfulness. It’s easier to pay
attention. You remember more of what you’ve done. You’re more creative.
You’re able to take advantage of opportunities when they present
themselves. You avert the danger not yet arisen. You like people better,
and people like you better, because you’re less evaluative. You’re more
charismatic.</p>
<p>The idea of procrastination and regret can go away, because if you
know why you’re doing something, you don’t take yourself to task for not
doing something else. If you’re fully present when you decide to
prioritize this task or work at this firm or create this product or
pursue this strategy, why would you regret it?</p>
<p>I’ve been studying this for nearly 40 years, and for almost any
measure, we find that mindfulness generates a more positive result. That
makes sense when you realize it’s a superordinate variable. No matter
what you’re doing—eating a sandwich, doing an interview, working on some
gizmo, writing a report—you’re doing it mindfully or mindlessly. When
it’s the former, it leaves an imprint on what you do. At the very
highest levels of any field—Fortune 50 CEOs, the most impressive artists
and musicians, the top athletes, the best teachers and mechanics—you’ll
find mindful people, because that’s the only way to get there.</p>
<p>How have you shown a link between mindfulness and innovation?</p>
<p>With Gabriel Hammond, a graduate student, I ran a study where we
asked participants to come up with new uses for products that had
failed. We primed one group for mindlessness by telling them how the
product had fallen short of its original intended use—to cite a famous
example from 3M, a failed glue. We primed the other for mindfulness by
simply describing the product’s properties—a substance that adheres for
only a short amount of time. Of course, the most creative ideas for new
uses came from the second group.</p>
<p>I’m an artist as well as a researcher, writer, and consultant—each
activity informs the others for me—and I got the idea to study
mindfulness and mistakes when I was painting. I looked up and saw I was
using ocher when I’d meant to use magenta, so I started trying to fix
it. But then I realized I’d made the decision to use magenta only
seconds before. People do this all the time. You start with uncertainty,
you make a decision, and if you make a mistake, it’s a calamity. But the
path you were following was just a decision. You can change it at any
time, and maybe an alternative will turn out better. When you’re
mindful, mistakes become friends.</p>
<p>How does being mindful make someone more charismatic?</p>
<p>We’ve shown this in a few studies. An early one was with magazine
salespeople: The mindful ones sold more and were rated as more likable
by buyers. More recently, we’ve looked at the bind that women executives
face: If they act in strong, stereotypically masculine ways, they’re
seen as bitchy, but if they act feminine, they’re seen as weak and not
leadership material. So we asked two groups of women to give persuasive
speeches. One group was told to act masculine, the other to act
feminine. Then half of each group was instructed to give their speech
mindfully, and we found that audiences preferred the mindful speakers,
regardless of what gender role they were playing out.</p>
<p>And mindfulness also makes you less judgmental about others?</p>
<p>Yes. We all have a tendency to mindlessly pigeonhole people: He’s
rigid. She’s impulsive. But when you freeze someone in that way, you
don’t get the chance to enjoy a relationship with them or use their
talents. Mindfulness helps you to appreciate why people behave the way
they do. It makes sense to them at the time, or else they wouldn’t do
it.</p>
<p>We did a study in which we asked people to rate their own character
traits—the things they would most like to change and the things they
most valued about themselves—and we found a big irony. The traits that
people valued tended to be positive versions of the ones they wanted to
change. So the reason I personally can’t stop being impulsive is that I
value being spontaneous. That means if you want to change my behavior,
you’ll have to persuade me not to like spontaneity. But chances are that
when you see me from this proper perspective—spontaneous rather than
impulsive—you won’t want to change me.</p>
<p>Mindful management</p>
<p>What else can managers do to be more mindful?</p>
<p>One tactic is to imagine that your thoughts are totally transparent.
If they were, you wouldn’t think awful things about other people. You’d
find a way to understand their perspective.</p>
<p>And when you’re upset about something—maybe someone turned in an
assignment late or didn’t do it the way you wanted—ask yourself, “Is it
a tragedy or an inconvenience?” It’s probably the latter. Most of the
things that get us upset are.</p>
<p>I also tell people to think about work/life integration, not balance.
“Balance” suggests that the two are opposite and have nothing in common.
But that’s not true. They’re both mostly about people. There are
stresses in both. There are schedules to be met. If you keep them
separate, you don’t learn to transfer what you do successfully in one
domain to the other. When we’re mindful, we realize that categories are
person constructed and don’t limit us.</p>
<p>Remember, too, that stress is not a function of events; it’s a
function of the view you take of events. You think a particular thing is
going to happen and that when it does, it’s going to be awful. But
prediction is an illusion. We can’t know what’s going to happen. So give
yourself five reasons you won’t lose the job. Then think of five reasons
why, if you did, it would be an advantage—new opportunities, more time
with family, et cetera. Now you’ve gone from thinking it’s definitely
going to happen to thinking maybe it will and even if it does, you’ll be
OK.</p>
<p>If you feel overwhelmed by your responsibilities, use the same
approach. Question the belief that you’re the only one who can do it,
that there’s only one way to do it, and that the company will collapse
if you don’t do it. When you open your views to be mindful, the stress
just dissipates.</p>
<p>Mindfulness helps you realize that there are no positive or negative
outcomes. There’s A, B, C, D, and more, each with its challenges and
opportunities.</p>
<p>Give me some scenarios, and I’ll explain how mindfulness helps.</p>
<p>I’m the leader of a team in dissent. People are arguing vehemently
for different strategies, and I have to decide on one.</p>
<p>There’s an old story about two people coming before a judge. One guy
tells his side of the story, and the judge says, “That’s right.” The
other guy tells his side of the story, and the judge says, “That’s
right.” They say, “We can’t both be right.” And the judge says, “That’s
right.” We have this mindless notion to settle disputes with a choice
between this way or that way, or a compromise. But win-win solutions can
almost always be sought. Instead of letting people lock into their
positions, go back and open it up. Have opponents play the debate from
the other side so that they realize there are good arguments either way.
Then find a way for both of them to be right.</p>
<p>I’m an executive with lots of commitments who’s facing a personal
crisis.</p>
<p>If I couldn’t do this interview because I was having a problem at
home, I would say, “Alison, I hope you’ll forgive me, but my mind is
elsewhere right now because I’m having this crisis.” And you might say,
“Oh, no, I had a crisis last week. It’s OK. I understand.” And then,
when the crisis was over, we could come back to what we were doing, but
with a whole new relationship, which would set us up for all sorts of
good things in the future.</p>
<p>I’m a boss giving a review to an underperforming employee.</p>
<p>Make clear that the evaluation is your perspective, not a universal
one, which opens up the dialogue. Let’s say a student or a worker adds
one and one and gets one. The teacher or employer can just say “Wrong,”
or he can try to figure out how the person got to one. Then the worker
says, “If you add one wad of chewing gum to another wad, one plus one
equals one.” Now the boss has learned something.</p>
<p>As a leader, you can walk around as if you’re God and get everybody
to quiver. But then you’re not going to learn anything, because they’re
not going to tell you, and you’re going to be lonely and unhappy. It
doesn’t have to be lonely at the top. You can be there and be open.</p>
<p>How do you create a more mindful organization?</p>
<p>When I’m doing consulting work with companies, I usually start by
showing every one how mindless they are and what they’re missing as a
result. You can be mindless only if two conditions are met: You’ve found
the very best way of doing things, and nothing changes. Of course, those
conditions can’t be met. So if you’re going to work, you should be there
and notice things. Then I explain that there are alternative ways of
getting anywhere, and in fact, you can’t even be sure that the
destination you’ve chosen is ultimately where you’ll want to be.
Everything looks different from different perspectives.</p>
<p>I tell leaders they should make not knowing OK—I don’t know, you
don’t know, nobody knows—rather than acting like they know, so every one
else pretends they know, which leads to all sorts of discomfort and
anxiety. Eliminate zero-accident policies. If you have a zero-accident
policy, you’re going to have a maximum-lying policy. Get people to ask,
“Why? What are the benefits of doing it this way versus another way?”
When you do that, every one relaxes a little, and you’re all better able
to see and take advantage of opportunities.</p>
<p>I was working with a nursing home years ago, and a nurse walked in,
complaining that one of the residents didn’t want to go to the dining
room. She wanted to stay in her room and eat peanut butter. So I butted
in and said, “What’s wrong with that?” Her answer was “What if everybody
wants to do it?” And I said, “Well, if everybody did it, you’d save a
lot of money on food. But, more seriously, it would tell you something
about how the food is being prepared or served. If it’s only one person
occasionally, what’s the big deal? If it happens all the time, there’s
an opportunity here.”</p>
<p>I imagine you don’t like checklists?</p>
<p>The first time you go through a checklist, it’s fine. But after that,
most people tend to do it mindlessly. So in aviation you have flaps up,
throttle open, anti-ice off. But if snow is coming and the anti-ice is
off, the plane crashes.</p>
<p>Checklists aren’t bad if they require qualitative information to be
obtained in that moment. For example, “Please note the weather
conditions. Based on these conditions, should the anti-ice be on or
off?” or “How is the patient’s skin color different from yesterday?” If
you ask questions that encourage mindfulness, you bring people into the
present and you’re more likely to avoid an accident.</p>
<p>Mindful, qualitative comments help in interpersonal relationships,
too, by the way. If you’re giving a compliment, “You look great” is not
nearly as effective as something like “Your eyes are sparkling today.”
To say that, you have to be there, and people will recognize and
appreciate it.</p>
<p>Mindfulness and focus</p>
<p>The business environment has changed a lot since you began studying
mindfulness. It’s more complex and uncertain. We have new data and
analysis coming at us all the time. So mindfulness becomes more
important for navigating the chaos—but the chaos makes it a lot harder
to be mindful.</p>
<p>I think chaos is a perception. People say that there’s too much
information, and I would say that there’s no more information now than
there was before. The difference is that people believe they have to
know it—that the more information they have, the better the product is
going to be and the more money the company is going to make. I don’t
think it depends as much on the amount of information someone has as on
the way it’s taken in. And that needs to be mindfully.</p>
<p>How has technology changed our ability to be mindful? Is it a help or
a hindrance?</p>
<p>Again, one can bring mindfulness to anything. We’ve studied
multitasking and found that if you’re open and keep the boundaries
loose, it can be an advantage. The information from one thing can help
you with another. I think what we should do is learn from the way
technology is fun and compelling and build that into our work.</p>
<p>HBR recently published an article on the importance of focus in which
the author, Daniel Goleman, talks about the need for both exploration
and exploitation. How do you balance mindfulness—constantly looking for
the new—with the ability to buckle down and get things done?</p>
<p>Vigilance, or very focused attention, is probably mindless. If I’m
racing through the woods on horseback, watching the branches so that I
don’t get hit in the face, I might miss the boulder on the ground, so
then my horse stumbles and I’m thrown off. But I don’t think that’s what
Dan means by focus. What you want is a soft openness—to be attentive to
the things you’re doing but not single-minded, because then you’re
missing other opportunities.</p>
<p>We hear the management community talking more about mindfulness now.
When did you realize that the ideas you’ve been studying for decades had
become mainstream?</p>
<p>I was at a party, and two different people came up to me and said,
“Your mindfulness is everywhere.” Of course, I just saw a new film that
starts with someone going around Harvard Square asking people what
mindfulness is, and nobody knows. So there’s still a lot of work to
do.</p>
<p>What are you working on next?</p>
<p>The Langer Mindfulness Institute works in three arenas: health,
aging, and the workplace. In health we want to see just how far we can
push the mind-body notion. Years ago we did studies on chambermaids (who
lost weight after being told their work was exercise) and vision (where
people did better on eye tests that had them work up from large letters
at the bottom to small ones at the top, creating the expectation that
they would be able to read them). Now we’re trying a mindfulness cure on
many diseases that people think are uncontrollable to see if we can at
least ameliorate the symptoms. We’re also doing counter clockwise
retreats around the world, starting in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico,
using research-proven techniques to help people live boldly. And we’re
doing conferences and consulting on work/life integration, mindful
leadership and strategy processes, stress reduction, and innovation,
with companies such as Thorlo and Santander and NGOs such as CARE and
Vermont’s Energy Action Network.</p>
<p>I’m told that I drive my students crazy because I’m always coming up
with new ideas. I’m thinking about maybe a mindfulness camp for
children. One exercise might be to take a group of 20 kids and keep
dividing them into subsets—male/female, younger/older, dark hair/light
hair, wearing black/not wearing black—until they realize that every one
is unique. As I’ve said for 30 years, the best way to decrease prejudice
is to increase discrimination. We would also play games and midway
through mix up the teams. Or maybe we’d give each child a chance to
rewrite the rules of the game, so it becomes clear that performance is
only a reflection of one’s ability under certain circumstances. You
know, if they allowed three serves in tennis, I would be a much better
player.</p>
<p>What’s the one thing about mindfulness you’d like every executive to
remember?</p>
<p>It’s going to sound corny, but I believe it fully: Life consists only
of moments, nothing more than that. So if you make the moment matter, it
all matters. You can be mindful, you can be mindless. You can win, you
can lose. The worst case is to be mindless and lose. So when you’re
doing anything, be mindful, notice new things, make it meaningful to
you, and you’ll prosper.</p>
