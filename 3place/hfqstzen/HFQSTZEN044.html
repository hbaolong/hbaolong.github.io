<h4 id="becoming-powerful-makes-you-less-empathetic">6 Becoming Powerful
Makes You Less Empathetic</h4>
<p>By Lou Solomon</p>
<p>Last year, I worked with a senior executive—let’s call him Steve—who
had received feedback from his boss that he was wearing the power of his
new title in an off-putting way. Steve’s boss told him that he had
developed a subtle way of being right in meetings that sucked all the
oxygen out of the room. No one wanted to offer ideas once Steve had
declared the right answer. Since his promotion, Steve had become less of
a team player and more of a superior who knew better than others. In
short, he had lost his empathy.</p>
<p>Why does this sort of shift in behavior happen to so many people when
they’re promoted to the ranks of management? Research shows that
personal power actually interferes with our ability to empathize. Dacher
Keltner, an author and social psychologist at the University of
California, Berkeley, has conducted empirical studies showing that
people who have power suffer deficits in empathy, the ability to read
emotions, and the ability to adapt behaviors to other people. In fact,
power can actually change how the brain functions, according to research
from Sukhvinder Obhi, a neuroscientist at Wilfrid Laurier University in
Ontario, Canada.1</p>
<p>The most common leadership failures don’t involve fraud, the
embezzlement of funds, or sex scandals. It’s more common to see leaders
fail in the area of every day self-management—and the use of power in a
way that is motivated by ego and self-interest.</p>
<p>How does it happen? Slowly, and then suddenly. It happens with bad
mini choices, made perhaps on an unconscious level. It might show up as
the subtle act of throwing one’s weight around. Demands for special
treatment, isolated decision making, and getting one’s way. Leaders who
are pulled over by the police for speeding or driving drunk become
indignant and rail, “Do you know who I am?” Suddenly the story hits
social media, and we change our minds about the once-revered
personality.</p>
<p>This points to a bigger story about power and fame. How do people
start out in pursuit of a dream and wind up aggrandizing themselves
instead? They reach a choke point, where they cross over from being
generous with their power to using their power for their own
benefit.</p>
<p>Take the case of former Charlotte, North Carolina, mayor Patrick
Cannon. Cannon came from nothing. He overcame poverty and the violent
loss of his father at the age of 5. He earned a degree from North
Carolina AandandandandT State University and entered public service at
the age of 26, becoming the youngest council member in Charlotte
history. He was known for being completely committed to serving the
public and generous with the time he spent as a role model for young
people.</p>
<p>But in 2014, Cannon, then 47, pleaded guilty to accepting 0,000 in
bribes while in office.2 As he entered the city’s federal courthouse, he
tripped and fell. The media was there to capture the fall, which was
symbolic of the much bigger fall of an elected leader and small business
owner who once embodied the very essence of personal achievement against
staggering odds. Cannon now has the distinction of being the first mayor
in the city’s history to be sent to prison. Insiders say he was a good
man but all too human, and he seemed vulnerable as he became isolated in
his decision making. And while a local minister argued that Cannon’s one
lapse in judgment should not define the man and his career of
exceptional public service, he is now judged only by his weakness: his
dramatic move from humility and generosity to corruption. And that image
of Cannon tripping on his way into court is now the image that people
associate with him.</p>
<p>What can leaders do if they fear that they might be crossing the line
from power to abuse of power? First, you must invite other people in.
You must be willing to risk vulnerability and ask for feedback. A good
executive coach can help you return to a state of empathy and
value-driven decisions. However, be sure to ask for feedback from a wide
variety of people. Dispense with the softball questions (How am I
doing?) and ask the tough ones (How does my style and focus affect my
employees?).</p>
<p>Preventive maintenance begins with self-awareness and a daring
self-inventory. Here are some important questions to ask yourself:</p>
<p>Do you have a support network of friends, family, and colleagues who
care about you without the title and can help you stay
down-to-earth?</p>
<p>Do you have an executive coach, mentor, or confidant?</p>
<p>What feedback have you gotten about not walking the talk?</p>
<p>Do you demand privileges?</p>
<p>Are you keeping the small, inconvenient promises that fall outside of
the spotlight?</p>
<p>Do you invite others into the spotlight?</p>
<p>Do you isolate yourself in the decision-making process? Do the
decisions you’re making reflect what you truly value?</p>
<p>Do you admit your mistakes?</p>
<p>Are you the same person at work, at home, and in the spotlight?</p>
<p>Do you tell yourself there are exceptions or different rules for
people like you?</p>
<p>If a leader earns our trust, we hold them to nonnegotiable standards.
Nothing will blow up more dramatically than a failure to walk the talk
or the selfish abuse of power. We all want our leaders to be highly
competent, visionary, take-charge people. However, empathy,
authenticity, and generosity are what distinguish competence and
greatness. The most self-aware leaders recognize the signals of abuse of
power and correct course before it’s too late.</p>
