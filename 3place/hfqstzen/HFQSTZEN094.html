Defusing an Emotionally Charged Conversation with a Colleague</h4>
<p>By Ron Friedman</p>
<p>Work with anyone long enough and you’re bound to encounter a
difference of opinion. Most of the time, these disagreements are
resolved amicably. But if you’re like most people, every now and then
you find yourself immersed in a conversation so emotionally charged it
seems to have nothing to do with the issues you’re supposedly
discussing.</p>
<p>What do you do when a conversation is spiraling out of control? When
you’ve tried all the patient listening you can muster, and the other
person still won’t budge? How do you get the conversation back on
track?</p>
<p>Anthony Suchman has invested a good portion of his career in
searching for an answer. A charming physician with a profound intellect,
Suchman has been studying the dynamics of human relationships for more
than three decades and has published his results in some of the world’s
leading medical journals.1</p>
<p>According to Suchman, every workplace conversation operates on two
levels: a task channel and a relationship channel. Occasionally the two
get fused, which is when disagreements intensify and collaborations
break down.</p>
<p>Here’s what he means: Suppose you and I are working together on a
project. Along the way, we have a difference of opinion about our next
steps. Perhaps I think we should use PowerPoint to deliver an important
presentation, and you see Power-Point as a poor communication tool. When
I express a point of view that’s different from yours, you may take our
disagreement at face value by saying, “Hmm, I guess Ron sees it
differently.” But if we’re new to working together, or if we’ve had a
few run-ins in the past, you’re likely to read beyond my suggestion and
use it to draw inferences about our relationship. For instance, you may
misinterpret my suggestion as a lack of trust, a sign of disrespect, or
even proof of competition.</p>
<p>It’s at this point, Suchman argues, that our task-focused
disagreement becomes contaminated with concerns about our relationship.
And when that happens, things escalate. Fast.</p>
<p>Neurologically, what Suchman is describing is the activation of a
fear response. When we perceive danger, our hypothalamus sends a signal
that releases adrenaline and cortisol into the bloodstream. That
triggers a fight-or-flight response that sends our bodies into
overdrive, short-circuiting our ability to concentrate or think
creatively. We experience tunnel vision.</p>
<p>In the evolutionary past, having an automatic reaction to fear was
quite useful. It helped protect us from oncoming predators and kept us
alive long enough to reproduce. But in today’s workplace, an involuntary
fear response can interfere with our ability to work collaboratively
with others. It’s one reason why the greater the emotional charge, the
harder it is to get either side to listen.</p>
<p>To defuse an emotionally volatile situation like this, Suchman
believes the first step is to disentangle the task and relational
channels. “When people disagree, it’s often because one party
misinterprets the feedback they’ve received as a personal attack,” he
says. “So it becomes: ‘If you like my idea, you like me,’ and ‘If you
don’t like my idea, you don’t like me.’ That puts a huge encumbrance on
the task channel and makes it really hard to speak openly.”</p>
<p>Our mental capacity is limited, Suchman points out, which means we
can attend to either the task channel or the relationship channel. It’s
when we get the two channels crossed that our ability to collaborate
constructively suffers. One approach to reducing tensions during
disagreements involves deliberately attending to the relational channel
and reaffirming your commitment to the relationship. This way there’s no
confusion about what the argument is really about. By momentarily
focusing on the relationship, you disentangle the personal from the
business.</p>
<p>Suchman recommends using a specific series of relationship-building
statements to make the conversation more productive, which are
represented in the acronym PEARLS:</p>
<p>Partnership</p>
<p>“I really want to work on this with you.”</p>
<p>“I bet we can figure this out together.”</p>
<h1 id="empathy">Empathy</h1>
<p>“I can feel your enthusiasm as you talk.”</p>
<p>“I can hear your concern.”</p>
<p>Acknowledgment</p>
<p>“You clearly put a lot of work into this.”</p>
<p>“You invested in this, and it shows.”</p>
<p>Respect</p>
<p>“I’ve always appreciated your creativity.”</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt you know a lot about this.”</p>
<p>Legitimation</p>
<p>“This would be hard for anyone.”</p>
<p>“Who wouldn’t be worried about something like this?”</p>
<p>Support</p>
<p>“I’d like to help you with this.”</p>
<p>“I want to see you succeed.”</p>
<p>Using relationship-building statements can feel unnatural at first,
especially when you’re not accustomed to complimenting others. I know
they did for me when I first started using them in workplace
conversations. The key, I’ve discovered, is to employ them sparingly at
first and to only say the ones that genuinely reflect how you feel.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, you’ll notice that inserting a well-timed PEARLS
statement can dramatically alter the tenor of a conversation. Because no
matter how far up we climb on an organizational ladder, we are still
stuck using an emotionally driven brain. When fear enters the equation,
it’s impossible to get people to do their best work, which is why
restoring confidence in the relationship can be a powerful tool.</p>
<p>The value of relationship-building statements extends far beyond the
workplace. They’re as effective with spouses, children, and friends as
they are with colleagues. The reason is simple: Anytime you attend to
people’s psychological need for connection, you have the potential to
improve the quality of an exchange. The more heated the argument, the
more vital the statements become.</p>
