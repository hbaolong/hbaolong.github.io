To Create Change, Leadership Is More Important Than Authority</h4>
<p>By Greg Satell</p>
<p>Aspiring junior executives dream of climbing the ladder to gain more
authority. Then they can make things happen and create the change that
they believe in. Senior executives, on the other hand, are often
frustrated by how little power they actually have.</p>
<p>The problem is that, while authority can compel action, it does
little to inspire belief. It’s not enough to get people to do what you
want, they also have to want what you want—or any change is bound to be
short-lived.</p>
<p>That’s why change management efforts commonly fail. All too often,
they are designed to carry out initiatives that come from the top. When
you get right down to it, that’s really just the same thing as telling
people to do what you want, albeit in slightly more artful way. To make
change really happen, it doesn’t need to be managed, but empowered.
That’s the difference between authority and leadership.</p>
<p>In the 1850s, Ignaz Semmelweis was the head physician at the
obstetric ward of a small hospital in Pest, Hungary. Having done
extensive research into how sanitary conditions could limit infections,
he instituted a strict regime of hand washing and virtually eliminated
the childbed fever that was endemic at the time.</p>
<p>In 2005, John Antioco was the eminently successful CEO of
Blockbuster, the 800-pound gorilla of the video rental industry. Yet,
despite the firm’s dominance, he saw a mortal threat coming in the form
of online streaming video and nimble competitors like Netflix. He
initiated an aggressive program to cancel late fees and invest in an
online platform.</p>
<p>Things ended poorly for both men. Semmelweis was castigated by the
medical community and died in an insane asylum, ironically of an
infection he contracted while under medical care. Antioco was fired by
his company’s board, and his successor reversed his reforms. Blockbuster
filed for bankruptcy in 2010.</p>
<p>While today the insights of Semmelweis and Antioco seem obvious, they
did not at the time. In the former case, it was believed that illness
was caused by an imbalance of humors, and in the latter, the threat of
online video seemed too distant to justify forsaking short-term profits.
Even given their positions of authority, neither was able to overcome
the majority view.</p>
<p>We tend to overestimate the power of influence. It always seems that
if we had a little bit more authority, had more data to back us up, or
were able to make our case more forcefully, we could drive our ideas
forward. Yet Semmelweis and Antioco not only had authority, but also had
the facts on their side and were willing to risk their careers. They
failed nonetheless.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, the eminent psychologist Solomon Asch performed a
series of famous experiments that help explain why. He showed the
following chart to a group of people and asked which line on the right
matched the line on the left.</p>
<p>It seems like a fairly simple task, and it should be, but Asch,
renowned for his ingenuity, added a twist. All of the people in the
room, except one, were confederates who gave the wrong answer. By the
time he got to the last person, who was the true subject, almost
everyone who participated conformed to the majority view, even though it
was obviously wrong.</p>
<p>While we like to think of ourselves as independent and freethinking,
the truth is that we are greatly affected by the views of those around
us. If you are in an office where people watch silly cat videos, you’ll
find yourself doing the same and laughing along. Yet often you’ll find
that they’re not nearly as funny when viewed in different company.</p>
<p>Conformity is never absolute. Even in Asch’s experiments, there were
some who held out, much like Semmelweis and Antioco. We all have our
points of conviction on which we are unlikely to be swayed, other areas
in which we need more convincing, and still others that we really don’t
care enough about to form much of an opinion at all.</p>
<p>That essentially is what the threshold model of collective behavior
predicts: Ideas take hold in small local majorities; many stop there and
never go any further, but some saturate those local clusters and move on
to more reluctant groups through weak ties. Eventually, a cascading
effect ensues.</p>
<p>The best-known example of the threshold model at work is the
diffusion of innovations model developed by Everett Rogers, in which a
small group of innovators gets hold of an idea and indoctrinates a
somewhat more reluctant group of early adopters to form local
majorities. The reticent denizens of those clusters find themselves
outnumbered and begin to conform, just as in Asch’s study. Before long,
the new converts find themselves passing the idea on to other social
groups they belong to. The process continues until the idea has grown
far beyond its original niche. Eventually, even the most skeptical
laggards join in.</p>
<p>Now we can see the failure of Semmelweis and Antioco—and the folly of
so many aspiring executives—for what it is. Rather than seeking to lead
a passionate band of willing innovators and build a movement, they
leaned on their authority to create wholesale change by forcing the
unconvinced against their will. Instead of painstakingly building local
majorities, they attempted to compel entire populations.</p>
<p>Control is an illusion and always has been an illusion. It is a
Hobbesian paradox that we cannot enforce change unless change has
already occurred. Higher status—or even a persuasive presentation full
of facts—is of limited utility. The lunatics run the asylum; the best we
can do as leaders is empower them to run it right.</p>
<p>And that’s why change always requires leadership rather than
authority. Respectable people always prefer incumbency to disruption.
Only misfits are threatened by the status quo. So if you want to create
real change, it is not power and influence that you need, but those who
seek to overthrow them.</p>
