<h4 id="the-power-of-listening-in-helping-people-change">9 The Power of
Listening in Helping People Change</h4>
<p>By Guy Itzchakov and Avraham N. (Avi) Kluger</p>
<p>Giving performance feedback is one of the most common ways managers
help their subordinates learn and improve. Yet research has revealed
that feedback can actually hurt performance: More than 20 years ago, one
of us (Avraham) analyzed 607 experiments on feedback effectiveness and
found that feedback caused performance to decline in 38% of cases.1 This
happened with both positive and negative feedback, mostly when the
feedback threatened how people saw themselves.</p>
<p>One reason that giving feedback (even when it’s positive) often
backfires is that it signals that the boss is in charge and the boss is
judgmental. This can make employees stressed and defensive, which makes
it harder for them to see another person’s perspective. For example,
employees can handle negative feedback by downplaying the importance of
the person providing the feedback or the feedback itself. People may
even reshape their social networks to avoid the feedback source in order
to restore their self-esteem.2 In other words, they defend themselves by
bolstering their attitudes against the person giving feedback.</p>
<p>We wanted to explore whether a more subtle intervention, namely
asking questions and listening, could prevent these consequences.
Whereas feedback is about telling employees that they need to change,
listening to employees and asking them questions might make them want to
change. In a recent paper, we consistently demonstrated that
experiencing high-quality (attentive, empathic, and nonjudgmental)
listening can positively shape speakers’ emotions and attitudes.3</p>
<p>WHAT MAKES LISTENING POWERFUL?</p>
<p>Listening as an avenue for self-change was advocated by the
psychologist Carl Rogers in a classic 1952 HBR article, “Barriers and
Gateways to Communication.” Rogers theorized that when speakers feel
that listeners are being empathic, attentive, and nonjudgmental, they
relax and share their inner feelings and thoughts without worrying about
what listeners will think of them. This safe state enables speakers to
delve deeper into their consciousness and discover new insights about
themselves—even those that may challenge previously held beliefs and
perceptions.</p>
<p>For example, consider an employee who believes that she always
respects her colleagues’ and customers’ feelings. If someone tells her
this isn’t true, it will likely lead her to protect her view of herself
by doubling down on her belief and discounting the other person’s
judgment. By contrast, if someone asks her to describe her interactions
with other people at work and listens attentively while encouraging her
to occasionally elaborate, she is likely to feel more secure with the
listener and open up in ways she might not otherwise. She might remember
incidents where she was disrespectful to customers or got angry at her
colleagues and be more open to discussing them and ways to change.</p>
<p>For example, in one laboratory experiment, we assigned 112
undergraduate students to serve as either a speaker or a listener and
paired them up, sitting face-to-face. We asked speakers to talk for 10
minutes about their attitudes toward a proposal for universal basic
income or a possible requirement that all university students must also
volunteer. We instructed the listeners to “listen as you listen when you
are at your best.” But we randomly distracted half of the listeners by
sending them text messages (such as “What event irritated you the most
recently?”) and instructed them to answer briefly (so the speakers saw
that they were distracted). Afterward, we asked the speakers questions
about whether they were worried about what their partner thought of
them, whether they acquired any insight while talking, and whether they
were confident in their beliefs.</p>
<p>We found that speakers paired with good listeners (versus those
paired with distracted listeners) felt less anxious and more self-aware
and reported higher clarity about their attitudes on the topics.
Speakers paired with undistracted listeners also reported wanting to
share their attitude with other people more compared with speakers
paired with distracted listeners.</p>
<p>Another benefit of high-quality listening is that it helps speakers
see both sides of an argument (what we call “attitude complexity”). In
another paper we found that speakers who conversed with a good listener
reported attitudes that were more complex and less extreme—in other
words, not one-sided.4</p>
<p>In a lab experiment we instructed 114 undergraduates at a business
school to talk for 12 minutes about their fitness to become a manager in
the future. We randomly assigned these speakers to one of three
listening groups (good, moderate, and poor). Speakers in the good
listening condition talked to a trained listener, who was either a
certified management coach or a trained social work student. We asked
these trained listeners to use all their listening skills, such as
asking questions and reflecting. Speakers in the moderate listening
condition talked to another undergraduate at the business school who was
instructed to listen as he or she usually does. Speakers in the poor
listening condition talked with a student from the theatre department
who was instructed to act distracted (such as by looking aside and
playing with their smartphone).</p>
<p>After the conversation, we asked the speakers to indicate separately
the extent to which they thought they were suitable for becoming
managers. Based on these answers, we calculated their attitude
complexity (whether they saw both strengths and weaknesses that would
affect their ability to be a manager) and extremity (whether they saw
only one side). We found that speakers who talked to a good listener saw
both strengths and weaknesses more than those in the other conditions.
Speakers who talked to a distracted listener mostly described their
strengths and barely acknowledged their weaknesses. Interestingly, the
speakers in the poor listening condition were those that, on average,
reported feeling the most suitable for becoming a manager.</p>
<p>We tested the relevance of these lab findings in three field studies
conducted among city hall employees, high-tech workers, and teachers
(180 workers, in total).5 In these studies, we asked employees to talk
about their colleagues, their supervisor, or about a meaningful
experience at work, before and after participating in a listening
intervention known as a listening circle. In the listening circle,
employees are invited to talk openly and honestly about an issue, like a
meaningful experience they had at work. They’re trained to listen
without interrupting, and only one person talks at a time.</p>
<p>We replicated all of our lab findings. Namely, employees who
participated in the listening circles reported lower social anxiety,
higher attitude complexity, and lower attitude extremity regarding
various work-related topics (such as attitude toward a manager) by
comparison with employees who participated in one of the control
conditions that did not involve trained listeners.</p>
<p>In concert, our findings suggest that listening seems to make an
employee more relaxed, more self-aware of his or her strengths and
weaknesses, and more willing to reflect in a nondefensive manner. This
can make employees more likely to cooperate (versus compete) with other
colleagues—as they become more interested in sharing their attitudes but
not necessarily in trying to persuade others to adopt them—and more open
to considering other points of view.</p>
<p>Going back to giving feedback, of course we do not claim that
listening must replace feedback. Rather, it seems that listening to
employees talk about their own experiences first can make giving
feedback more productive by helping them feel psychologically safe and
less defensive.6</p>
<p>Listening has its enemies</p>
<p>Our findings support existing evidence that managers who listen well
are perceived as people leaders, generate more trust, instill higher job
satisfaction, and increase their team’s creativity.7 Yet if listening is
so beneficial for employees and for organizations, why is it not more
prevalent in the workplace? Why are most employees not listened to in
the way they want? Research shows that a few barriers often stand in the
way.</p>
<p>Loss of power. Research from our team has shown that some managers
may feel that if they listen to their employees they are going to be
looked upon as weak.8 But at the same time, it’s been shown that being a
good listener means gaining prestige. So it seems managers must make a
trade-off between attaining status based on intimidation and getting
status based on admiration.</p>
<p>Listening consumes time and effort. In many instances, managers
listen to employees under time pressure or while they’re distracted by
other thoughts or work. So listening is an investment decision: Managers
must put in the time to listen in order to see the future benefits.</p>
<p>Fear of change. High-quality listening can be risky because it
entails entering a speaker’s perspective without trying to make
judgments. This process could potentially change the listener’s
attitudes and perceptions. We observed several times that when we
trained managers to truly listen, they gained crucial insights about
their employees; they were stunned to learn how little they knew about
the lives of people they’d worked with for many years.</p>
<p>For example, several managers reported that when they tried listening
to employees whom they’d confronted about poor attendance, they learned
that these employees were struggling with supporting a family member (a
wife dying of cancer, a sibling with a mental disability). This
realization threatened managers’ attitudes and views about themselves—an
experience called cognitive dissonance that can be difficult.</p>
<p>Tips for becoming a better listener</p>
<p>Listening resembles a muscle. It requires training, persistence,
effort, and, most important, the intention to become a good listener. It
requires clearing your mind from internal and external noise—and if
that’s not possible, postponing the conversation for when you can truly
listen without being distracted. Here are some best practices.</p>
<p>Give 100% of your attention, or do not listen. Put aside your
smartphone, tablet, or laptop, and look at the speaker, even if they do
not look back at you. In an ordinary conversation, a speaker looks at
you occasionally to see that you’re still listening. Constant eye
contact lets the speaker feel that you are listening.</p>
<p>Do not interrupt. Resist the urge to interrupt before the speaker
indicates that they are done for the moment. In our workshop, we give
managers the following instruction: “Go to someone at your work who
makes listening very hard on you. Let them know that you are learning
and practicing listening and that today, you will only listen for ___
minutes (where the blank could be 3, 5, or even 10 minutes), and delay
responding until the predetermined listening time is up or even until
the following day.”</p>
<p>Managers are often amazed at their discoveries. One shared, “In six
minutes, we completed a transaction that otherwise would have taken more
than an hour.” Another told us, “The other person shared things with me
that I had prevented her from saying for 18 years.”</p>
<p>Do not judge or evaluate. Listen without jumping to conclusions and
interpreting what you hear. You may notice your judgmental thoughts, but
push them aside. If you notice that you’ve lost track of the
conversation due to your judgments, apologize and explain to the speaker
that your mind was distracted, and ask them to repeat. Don’t pretend to
listen.</p>
<p>Don’t impose your solutions. The role of the listener is to help the
speaker draw up a solution on their own. Therefore, when listening to a
fellow colleague or subordinate, refrain from suggesting solutions. If
you believe you have a good solution and feel an urge to share it, frame
it as a question, such as “I wonder what will happen if you choose to do
X?”</p>
<p>Ask more (good) questions. Listeners shape conversations by asking
questions that benefit the speaker.9 Good listening requires being
thoughtful about what the speaker needs help with most and crafting a
question that would lead the speaker to search for an answer. Ask
questions to help someone delve deeper into their thoughts and
experiences.</p>
<p>Before you ask a question, ask yourself, “Is this question intended
to benefit the speaker or satisfy my curiosity?” Of course, there is
room for both, but a good listener prioritizes the needs of the other.
One of the best questions you can ask is “Is there anything else?” This
often exposes novel information and unexpected opportunities.</p>
<p>Reflect. When you finish a conversation, reflect on your listening,
and think about missed opportunities—moments in which you ignored
potential leads or remained silent when you could have asked questions.
When you feel that you were an excellent listener, consider what you
gained and how you can apply this type of listening in more challenging
circumstances.</p>
