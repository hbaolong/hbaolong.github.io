<h4 id="knut-the-great-and-the-north-sea-empire">104. Knut the Great and
the North Sea Empire</h4>
<p>Knýtlinga saga (The Story of the Family of Knut) records the exploits
of Knut (also Cnut/Canute) the Great, a son of Svein Forkbeard and a
grandson of Harald Bluetooth. Knut was born in the 990s and was a
participant in his father’s expedition to England in 1013, which ousted
King Athelred and won Svein the kingship of England. Svein died mere
months later, in February 1014, and a power struggle ensued between Knut
and the English, led once again by Athelred. By the end of 1016 both
Athelred and his son Edmund were dead, the English had been defeated,
and Knut had been chosen as king. He added the title king of Denmark in
1019 (his brother had assumed power there on the death of Svein), and in
Norway he expelled King Olaf Haraldsson (later Saint Olaf) in 1025. Olaf
was slain on his return in 1030 at the battle of Stiklestad near
Trondheim. Knut’s shrewdness in marrying Athelred’s widow, Queen Emma,
in 1017, his enthusiastic support of the English church, his long and
fairly peaceful reign, and his interactions with other European rulers
have won him a favorable reputation as a ruler: in the judgment of the
great Anglo-Saxonist Sir Frank Stenton, Knut was “the first Viking
leader to be admitted into the civilized fraternity of Christian kings.”
His so-called North Sea Empire did not survive his death in 1035, aged
only about 40 years.</p>
<p>Source: Knýtlinga saga, in Danakonunga sögur, ed. Bjarni Guðnason,
Íslenzk fornrit XXXV (Reykjavík, 1982), pp. 99–127.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>After King Svein’s death, Danish chieftains held on to the part of
England they had conquered. Then fighting started again because, as soon
as King Svein died, Athelred [King Athelred the Unready, ca 968–1016]
came back and re-entered his kingdom with the support of Saint Olaf
[king of Norway]. This is recounted in Saint Olaf’s saga in the words of
Ottar the Black Poet, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p>Lord, you gave back his land</p>
<p>to Athelred; the people’s prince</p>
<p>profited from your power;</p>
<p>strong, you strengthened his kingdom.</p>
<p>A fierce fight brought</p>
<p>the kin of King Edmund back</p>
<p>to their hereditary home,</p>
<p>long ruled by their line.</p>
<p>At this time, the Danes established the housekarls [king’s bodyguard]
in England. These mercenaries, who were exceptionally brave, did much of
the fighting against the English.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Knut, son of Svein Forkbeard, was ten years old when his father
died. Since Harald, his brother, was already dead, he was made king over
Denmark and the whole Danish empire. The Danish chiefs who occupied the
English territory won by Svein sent word to Denmark that King Knut
should come west with a Danish army as reinforcement against the
English. However, since Knut was still a child without experience of
command, his friends suggested that he should send the army to England,
appointing others to command it, and not go himself until he was older.
And so that’s how it came about that he stayed in Denmark for three
years after coming to the throne.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the three years were over, he levied an army for overseas. At
the same time, he sent word to his brother-in-law, Earl Eirik, in
Norway, asking him to muster an army and travel to England with him, for
Earl Eirik was highly regarded for his courage and skill in warfare. He
had been victorious in the two most famous battles ever fought in the
Northlands. One of these was Svold [1000] where he, King Svein
Forkbeard, and King Olaf of Norway had fought against Olaf Tryggvason
and the other was at Hjorungafjord [988] where he and his father, Earl
Hakon, defeated the Jomsvikings. Knut headed west to England with a huge
force, as Ottar the Black relates in Knútsdrápa [Knut’s Praise
Poem]:</p>
<p>While yet young,</p>
<p>king, conqueror of fleets,</p>
<p>you launched longships. No younger</p>
<p>prince ever departed his homeland.</p>
<p>You readied ships, bows bound</p>
<p>in iron, prince. You faced perils</p>
<p>And with murderous mind,</p>
<p>Raised red shields against England.</p>
<p>He says too:</p>
<p>Generous prince, the Jutes</p>
<p>followed you fearlessly.</p>
<p>And you, sea-king, mustered soldiers</p>
<p>from Skaney for the sea-voyage.</p>
<p>Above you sails swelled;</p>
<p>you steered your ships west.</p>
<p>Your name will be known,</p>
<p>prince, for this sea-passage.</p>
<p>Many chiefs followed Knut to England. The most outstanding was Earl
Ulf Sprakaleggsson [Strut-Leg’s Son], his brother-in-law, who was
married to Astrid, daughter of Svein and sister of King Knut. Also there
were the brothers Heming and Thorkel the Tall, the sons of Strut-Harald
as well as many other chiefs. King Knut reached England and sailed into
the mouth of the Humber, as they call it. Hallvard Hareksblesi recounts
this in Knútsdrápa:</p>
<p>Keen for the conflict,</p>
<p>the sword-warrior set sail.</p>
<p>Knut, you steered iron-stemmed</p>
<p>ships forward to Fljóta.</p>
<p>Overseas in England</p>
<p>you moored in Humber-mouth,</p>
<p>gratifying the gluttony</p>
<p>of battle’s bird, the raven.</p>
<p>As soon as Knut reached England, he went ashore and began plundering,
killing the people and burning their houses, as Ottar the Black
relates:</p>
<p>Great king, you gained power</p>
<p>with your war-shield;</p>
<p>no pleasure for you, prince,</p>
<p>in the leisurely life;</p>
<p>Jutes’ general, you destroyed</p>
<p>Edgar’s line on that expedition.</p>
<p>King’s kin, your</p>
<p>stubborn strength crushed them.</p>
<p>He says this too:</p>
<p>Prince, while yet a youth</p>
<p>you set farms aflame,</p>
<p>and the fire forced men</p>
<p>into the ways of war.</p>
<p>The local inhabitants assembled an army, marched on the Danes and
engaged them in battle, as Thord Kolbeinsson says:</p>
<p>The raven-rewarders [Danes],</p>
<p>long loathed in the land,</p>
<p>came ashore early from their ships,</p>
<p>entered England.</p>
<p>The farmers raised a force</p>
<p>to defend their dwellings;</p>
<p>the soldiers of the sword-prince [Knut]</p>
<p>braved them in battle.</p>
<p>Lindsey was the site of King Knut’s first battle in England and there
was great slaughter. Then Knut captured Hemingborough and, again, many
people were killed. Ottar says:</p>
<p>In Lindsey’s green fields you gave</p>
<p>battle, brave prince.</p>
<p>Danes did as they pleased</p>
<p>with the conquered country.</p>
<p>Slayer of Swedes,</p>
<p>you made the English endure</p>
<p>much misery in Hemingborough</p>
<p>out to the west of the Ouse.</p>
<p>After that, he fought major battles in Northumberland near the Tees.
Many people died there, and some escaped only to perish in the nearby
fens and ditches. Then King Knut marched his army further south and was
victorious wherever he went.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>In the same summer or autumn as King Knut invaded England, King
Athelred fell ill and died, having been king of England for thirty-eight
years. His wife, Queen Emma, got ready to leave the country as soon as
Athelred died, intending to travel west to France to meet her brothers,
William and Robert, who were both earls there. Their father was Richard
Richardsson, earl of Rouen, who was the son of William Longspear. He was
the son of Gongu-Hrolf, who conquered Normandy; and Gongu-Hrolf was the
son of Rognvald, earl of Møre in Norway.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, King Knut’s men got to hear about Queen Emma’s journey and
when she and her men were about to put to sea, Knut’s men turned up and
seized the ship with everything in it. Queen Emma was brought before
King Knut, and the king and his chiefs decided that he should marry her.
And that is what happened.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>After King Athelred’s death, his sons by Queen Emma were chosen as
his successors. Edmund the Strong was the eldest, second came Edgar,
third was Edvig, and fourth was Edward the Good [the Confessor].</li>
</ol>
<p>King Edmund now assembled a large army and moved against King Knut.
They met at a place called Sherston where they fought the most famous
battle of the day with terrible slaughter on both sides. King Edmund
rode right into the middle of the Danish army, coming close enough to
his stepfather, King Knut, to strike him with a sword. Knut thrust his
shield forward over his horse’s neck, but the blow from the sword was so
powerful that it cut right through the shield a little below the
hand-grip and sliced into the horse’s shoulders just in front of the
saddle. The Danes then attacked King Edmund so furiously that he had to
retreat toward his own side, but not before he had killed many Danes,
though he himself was wounded only slightly, if at all. However, when
King Edmund had ridden so far ahead of his men that they had lost sight
of him and thought that he must be dead, the army began to run away,
and, though some of his men saw him riding back from the Danes, they all
fled, including those who had seen him. The king shouted loudly to his
army and ordered them to turn and fight, but they acted as though they
hadn’t heard him. The whole army ran for it and there followed a most
awful slaughter, with the Danes hunting the routed army till nightfall.
Thus says Ottar the Black:</p>
<p>Young prince, you felled</p>
<p>English troops by the Tees.</p>
<p>A deep ditch was choked with the dead,</p>
<p>clogged with Northumbrian corpses.</p>
<p>In the south, the inciter of strife</p>
<p>disturbed the dark raven’s dream.</p>
<p>Svein’s brave son</p>
<p>brought the battle to Sherston.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>As usual, Earl Ulf was in the front rank of King Knut’s soldiers and
he followed the fugitives furthest. He came to a forest so thick that
for the whole night he couldn’t find his way out until daylight
appeared. Then, before him, on some open ground he saw a young man in
his prime herding some sheep. Earl Ulf approached the young man, greeted
him, and asked his name.</li>
</ol>
<p>“I’m called Godwin,” the youth answered. “Are you one of Knut’s
men?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m one of his soldiers,” replied Ulf. “How far is it to our
ships from here?”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that you Danes can expect much help from us,” said the
young man. “In fact, you may get something quite different.”</p>
<p>“At the moment, young man, I’d be happy if you’d just point me in the
direction of our ships,” replied Earl Ulf.</p>
<p>“You’ve been heading in the wrong direction entirely,” said the
youth. “Instead of making for the ships, you’ve been going inland
through dense forest. And, in this area, Knut’s men aren’t too popular
with the locals, which is understandable since they’ve just heard about
yesterday’s massacre at Sherston. If the farmers catch you, neither you
nor any other of Knut’s men can expect quarter, and the same goes for
anyone who helps you. But it seems to me that there might be some profit
to be made from you, for I don’t think you’re the man you say you
are.”</p>
<p>Then Earl Ulf removed a gold ring from his arm and said, “I’ll give
you this ring if you’ll guide me to my men.”</p>
<p>Godwin looked at him for a while and then said slowly, “I won’t
accept your ring, but I will try to bring you to your men. If I do
manage to help you, I would rather you were under an obligation to me;
if I can’t help you, there is no need for a reward. But first, you must
come home with me to meet my father.” And that is what they did.</p>
<p>When they came to the farm, they went into a small living room where
Godwin had a table set and good drink served. Earl Ulf observed that
this was a fine, well-furnished farm. Then the farmer and his wife came
in. They were good-looking, well-dressed people who gave their guest a
warm welcome. He stayed there all day enjoying excellent hospitality,
and toward night two good horses were saddled up with the finest
harness. Then the farmer and his wife spoke to Ulf.</p>
<p>“I’ll say farewell and place my only son in your hands,” said the
farmer, whose name was Ulfnoth. “If you reach your king and your word
counts for anything, I’d ask you to find a position for Godwin; for,
however I manage, he can’t stay on here in case our countrymen find out
that he has helped you to escape.” Ulf promised that Godwin could join
his comrades, for he was a handsome, well-spoken young man.</p>
<p>Earl Ulf and Godwin rode all night and arrived at Knut’s ships just
after daybreak. Some of the men were ashore and when they recognized
Ulf, they all crowded around and gave him a welcome fit for a man who
seemed to have been recalled from the dead, for he was so popular that
everyone loved him wholeheartedly. For the first time, Godwin realized
who his companion was.</p>
<p>The earl had Godwin sit next to him on the high seat and treated him
exactly as he himself or his own son was treated. To put it briefly, Ulf
gave Godwin his sister, Gytha, in marriage, and Ulf’s strong support
persuaded his brother-in-law, Knut, to bestow an earldom upon Godwin.
The sons of Godwin and Gytha were Harold, king of England and the earls
Tosti (called Longspear), Morkar, Waltheow, and Svein. Their descendants
include many great men in England, Denmark, Sweden, and to the east in
Russia, as well as the royal house of Denmark. Earl Godwin’s son, King
Harold, had a daughter called Gytha, who married King Valdamar of
Novgorod, and their son King Harold had two daughters who will be
mentioned later.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>King Knut fought and won another major battle, this time at a town
named Brentford. Athelred’s sons fled, losing a large army and the Danes
demolished the town, as Ottar the Black says:</li>
</ol>
<p>Prince, breaker of peace and shields,</p>
<p>feller of Frisians,</p>
<p>you brought ruin to Brentford,</p>
<p>destroyed the dwellings.</p>
<p>King Edmund’s noble kinsman</p>
<p>suffered savage wounds and</p>
<p>Danish soldiers showered spears</p>
<p>as the English forces fled.</p>
<p>King Knut fought the third major battle against the sons of Athelred
at a place known as Ashton, to the north of the Danewoods. Ottar
says:</p>
<p>Shield-bearing Scyld’s son,</p>
<p>you wrought war’s works at Ashton,</p>
<p>where the bird of battle feasted</p>
<p>on men’s bloody meat.</p>
<p>With sword strokes,</p>
<p>prince, you won a worthy</p>
<p>name, north of Daneswood,</p>
<p>when you massacred many.</p>
<p>King Knut’s fourth battle against Edmund and his brothers was fought
at Norwich. It was another major battle and many men died. King Knut was
the victor and the sons of Athelred were put to flight. Ottar the Black
says the following:</p>
<p>Generous gift-giver, who</p>
<p>made mail-shirts bloody in Norwich,</p>
<p>you will lose life before you</p>
<p>lose courage, lord.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>Next, King Knut led his army to the Thames, for he had heard that
King Edmund and his brothers had fled to London. When he arrived at the
Thames Estuary, Earl Eirik, his brother-in-law, sailed in from the sea
and they advanced together up the river with their forces. Thord
Kolbeinsson says in Eiríksdrápa [Eirik’s Praise-Poem]:</li>
</ol>
<p>The kinship of earl and king</p>
<p>prospered on the path to battle;</p>
<p>ships of many sizes sailed</p>
<p>up the estuary;</p>
<p>Earl Eirik, kinsman of kings,</p>
<p>steered his ships, dark serpents</p>
<p>of the sea, so close to land that the</p>
<p>fields of England were in full view.</p>
<p>And he composed this too:</p>
<p>Onward pressed the Danish prince,</p>
<p>ploughed through the sea paths,</p>
<p>sent his longships speeding</p>
<p>to the shoals at the shore;</p>
<p>the helmeted earl and Knut the king</p>
<p>met joyfully that morning,</p>
<p>with both men bent</p>
<p>on sailing the sea ways.</p>
<p>In the middle of the Thames, a large fort had been built and
garrisoned to defend the land against ship-borne armies coming up river.
King Knut sailed up the Thames and attacked the fort, but an English
fleet sailed down river from London and joined battle with the Danes.
Ottar the Black says:</p>
<p>Bows sang loud, swords bit,</p>
<p>your attack went well against</p>
<p>weapon-bearing warriors</p>
<p>when your forces assaulted the fort.</p>
<p>The wolf’s teeth well know,</p>
<p>sailor of the dark ships,</p>
<p>that you gained no less glory</p>
<p>in the shallows and shoals of the Thames.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>King Knut led his whole army to London and, having set up camp, made
an assault on the town, but the townsmen defended it, as is related in
this poem composed by the Danish soldiers who were present:</li>
</ol>
<p>Day after day, on the banks</p>
<p>of the Thames, the triumphing Valkyrie sees</p>
<p>flesh-tearing swords stained with blood,</p>
<p>and the hanged god’s ravens replete;</p>
<p>sees the victory-seeking</p>
<p>prince pursuing brave townsmen,</p>
<p>and bloodied swords, bright as ice,</p>
<p>beating against British armor.</p>
<p>And this too:</p>
<p>For this day’s dueling,</p>
<p>many an eager man</p>
<p>puts on the rusty, old ring-mail</p>
<p>we’ve been born and bred to;</p>
<p>still, we feed Odin’s fowl,</p>
<p>the raven, with red English blood;</p>
<p>the skald slips swiftly</p>
<p>into his hammered mail-shirt.</p>
<p>King Knut fought many battles there, but he failed to take the
town.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>Earl Eirik led part of the army and some of the housekarls inland
against the English army commanded by a great chieftain, Ulfkell
Snilling. In the battle that followed, Eirik won and Ulfkell fled. Thord
Kolbeinsson says in Eiríksdrápa:</li>
</ol>
<p>The Gold-giver got ready</p>
<p>for war, west of London;</p>
<p>the famous sea-farer</p>
<p>fought fiercely for land;</p>
<p>blue-edged blades shivered</p>
<p>over the housekarls’ heads</p>
<p>when Ulfkell endured</p>
<p>a staggering stroke.</p>
<p>Earl Eirik fought another battle against the English at Ringmere. As
Thord Kolbeinsson says:</p>

<p>soldiers’ limbs with the sword edge,</p>
<p>glutted grim ravens</p>

<p>to the English, bold Eirik</p>
<p>dealt death,</p>
<p>reducing their ranks,</p>
<p>and reddening Ringmere Heath.</p>
<p>Earl Eirik won this battle. Thord Kolbeinsson says more about his
campaign in Eiríksdrápa:</p>
<p>The raven-rewarders [Danes],</p>
<p>long loathed in the land,</p>
<p>came ashore early from their ships,</p>
<p>entered England.</p>
<p>The farmers raised a force</p>
<p>to defend their dwellings;</p>
<p>the soldiers of the sword-prince [Knut]</p>
<p>braved them in battle.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>King Knut besieged London. King Emund and his brothers defended it
while messengers went to and fro between them. King Knut had married
their mother, Queen Emma, and so hostages were exchanged and a truce was
called to allow for discussion and the negotiation of a more permanent
treaty. In the consultations that followed, an agreement was reached to
the effect that the kingdom would be divided in two and that each of
them would have half as long as they were both alive, but if one of them
died childless, the survivor would inherit the whole kingdom unopposed.
This treaty was confirmed by oaths.</li>
</ol>
<p>King Knut paid a powerful man called Eadric Strjona to betray King
Edmund and murder him, and that was how he died, even though Eadric was
his foster-father and was trusted by King Edmund as he trusted himself.
Afterwards, King Knut drove all the sons of King Athelred out of
England. Many battles were fought because of this, but they could never
raise a strong enough force to resist King Knut after the death of King
Edmund. Sigvat the skald says in Knútsdrápa:</p>
<p>Soon King Knut</p>
<p>struck at the sons</p>
<p>of Athelred,</p>
<p>ousting them from England.</p>
<p>Then the sons of Athelred went to France and stayed in Normandy for a
long time with their uncles Robert and William, as the saga of Saint
Olaf recounts.</p>
<p>Earl Eirik, son of Hakon, died in England just when he was on the
point of making a pilgrimage to Rome. He died when his uvula was removed
and the bleeding could not be stopped.</p>
<p>King Knut and Queen Emma had three children. Harald was the eldest,
second was Harda-Knut, and their daughter was Gunnhild, who later
married the emperor Henry the Gentle, the third of his line with that
name. King Knut’s third son was called Svein, but his mother was Alfifa
the Wealthy, the daughter of Earl Alfrun.</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>In the days when King Knut ruled England and Denmark, Olaf
Haraldsson [later Saint Olaf] was king of Norway. When Olaf came to the
throne, Earl Svein, son of Hakon, and Earl Hakon Eiriksson, Knut’s
nephew, fled the country. Earl Hakon Eiriksson traveled to England and
visited his uncle, King Knut, who received him warmly. Later,
hostilities broke out between King Olaf and King Knut, and Knut and Earl
Hakon invaded Norway with an overwhelming force; this happened near the
end of King Olaf’s life. They subdued the whole country and King Knut
installed his nephew, Hakon, as ruler of Norway, while he himself
returned to Denmark.</li>
</ol>
<p>When King Olaf fled Norway, he went east to Russia. Two years later,
he returned to Norway and fought a terrible battle at Stiklastad [1030],
against the landowners, who had broken faith with him and become his
enemies. As most people know, King Olaf died there and is now
sanctified; he lies in a shrine at Nidaros.</p>
<p>The year before the death of the king, Saint Olaf, Earl Hakon
Eiriksson died in the English Sea [North Sea]. Then Svein, the son of
King Knut and Alfifa, went to Norway and was appointed king of the whole
country by order of his father. King Knut, also made his son,
Harda-Knut, king of the Danish empire, and appointed his son, Harald,
king of his considerable territories in Scotland. Knut himself, however,
was over-king and was called Knut the Great, or Knut the Old. Of all the
Scandinavian kings, Knut was the most powerful and had the most
extensive lands.</p>
<p>King Knut traveled abroad on a pilgrimage to Rome and his expenditure
on the journey was so vast that no one could calculate the cost in
marks, and only with difficulty in pounds. As well as bringing money
from his own kingdom, he also made use of the emperor’s property freely
wherever he wished. While King Knut was on his pilgrimage to Rome, no
one who met him needed to beg for his food, for he gave everyone so much
money to spend. King Knut traveled on foot from Flanders to Rome, as
Sigvat the skald says:</p>
<p>Few gold-givers</p>
<p>will set out for the south,</p>
<p>fare on foot like you,</p>
<p>peerless prince.</p>
<p>King Knut founded a hostel where any Danish-speaker who turned up
could get food and lodging for the night and, wherever he went, he
distributed large amounts of money to monasteries and other important
religious establishments.</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li><p>When he returned to his kingdom in England, he came down with an
illness, which showed up first as jaundice. He lay ill for a long time
during the summer and in the autumn he died on 13 November [1035] in the
great city of Winchester, where he is buried. He was thirty-seven years
old and had been king of Denmark for twenty-seven years, England for
twenty-four, and Norway for seven. It is generally agreed that Knut had
more power and more extensive territories than any other Scandinavian
king.</p></li>
<li><p>Knut was the most open-handed of all northern kings for, in
truth, not only was he more generous than other kings in the gifts he
showered on his friends every year, but also he received much more
annually in taxes and dues from three kingdoms than anyone who ruled
only one kingdom. Added to that, England was the richest kingdom in the
Northlands.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>An example of his generosity was the case of the Icelander, Thorarin
Loftunga [Praise-Tongue]. He was an excellent skald who had been in the
service of kings and other great men for much of his long life. When he
was an old man, he went to see King Knut because he had composed a poem
about him. He came before the king, paid his respects, and asked the
king if he would listen to a poem composed in his honor. It so happened
that the king was seated at table after dinner, and several men were
standing in front of the table presenting their suits. The king listened
to them first, and when they had finished talking, Thorarin said his
piece, for he was not overawed by kings and had often spoken before
great men.</p>
<p>“My lord,” he said, “I’m asking you again to listen to my poem; it
won’t take long for there aren’t many stanzas.”</p>
<p>Knut looked at him rather angrily and answered, “No one but you has
ever insulted me by composing a ‘drápling’ [little drápa] about me. Now
get this clear: at breakfast time tomorrow, you will come here and
recite a drápa [praise-poem of 30 stanzas or more] in praise of me. You
will compose it in the time I have allowed you, or you’re dead.”</p>
<p>Thorarin went away and started working on a drápa about King Knut,
salvaging whatever he could from the poem he had brought with him; the
drápa is called Head-Ransom. Next morning, he recited the poem before
the king and it went over very well. The king rewarded him for the poem
with a gift of fifty marks of pure silver. Afterwards, Thorarin composed
another drápa, called Togdrápa, for King Knut. Part of it went like
this:</p>
<p>I have richly</p>
<p>repaid</p>
<p>the fifty marks I got</p>
<p>from war’s master,</p>
<p>which he gave,</p>
<p>—Great bringer of death—</p>
<p>for my poem,</p>
<p>when I visited the prince.</p>
<p>King Knut presented two gold arm-rings, each weighing a mark, and a
gold-mounted sword to Bersi, son of the Skald-woman, Torfa. Sigvat the
skald puts it thus:</p>
<p>Bersi, King Knut,</p>
<p>so distinguished in deeds,</p>
<p>enriched our arms splendidly</p>
<p>when we met the great man;</p>
<p>in his wisdom, he awarded you</p>
<p>a gold mark or more, and a sharp sword;</p>
<p>there was half a mark for me;</p>
<p>great God himself rules all.</p>
<p>When King Knut died in England, there died with him the liberality of
generations of Danish kings, each of whom had a more extensive kingdom
than his father.</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>Knut was extremely tall and strong. He was an outstandingly handsome
man, except for his nose, which was thin, high-set, and slightly
crooked. He had a fair complexion and thick blond hair. His eyes were
more beautiful than other people’s and his eyesight was keener. He was a
generous man and a great soldier; he was gallant, victorious, and
exceptionally fortunate in everything concerning power and wealth. But
he was not a very reflective man, and the same is true of Svein, Harald,
and Gorm before him. None of them were great thinkers.</li>
