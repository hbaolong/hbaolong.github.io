<h4 id="c-the-saga-of-the-people-of-eyri">(c) The Saga of the People of
Eyri</h4>
<p>The Saga of the People of Eyri [Eyrbyggja saga] tells how Bjorn, son
of Ketil Flatnose, settles in Iceland. Like many of the early settlers,
Bjorn did not migrate directly to Iceland, but went there only after a
stay in the British Isles (see doc. 20).</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Eyrbyggja saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit IV (Reykjavík, 1935),
pp. 5–11.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Bjorn, the son of Ketil Flatnose, lived in Jämtland until Earl
Kjallak, his foster-father, died. He married the earl’s daughter,
Gjaflaug. Later, he traveled west across the Kiolen Mountains, arriving
first at Trondheim and then going south. He took over the lands his
father owned and drove away the stewards who had been put in charge of
the property by King Harald. The king was in the Vik when he heard about
this. Thereupon, he left for Trondheim, taking the inland route north.
When he arrived at Trondheim, he summoned a Thing from eight districts
at which he outlawed Bjorn Ketilsson in Norway and declared that he
might be killed or seized wherever he turned up. After that, the king
dispatched Hauk Habrok [High-Breeches] and others of his warriors to
kill Bjorn wherever they could find him.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the king’s men came south to Stad, Bjorn’s friends got to hear
about their approach and passed on the information to him. Then Bjorn
hurried aboard a small ship that he had, taking his household and
portable property with him. He sailed south, hugging the coast because
it was the depth of winter and he didn’t dare head for the open sea.
Bjorn kept going until he reached the island called Most, which lies off
South Hordaland. There he was welcomed by a man called Hrolf, the son of
Ornolf the Whale-Driver. Bjorn stayed there secretly for the winter. The
king’s men turned back when they had taken over Bjorn’s properties and
placed men in charge of them.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Hrolf was a great chieftain and a very open-handed man. He looked
after the temple of Thor on the island, and was a great friend of Thor.
For that reason, he was called Thorolf. He was a tall, strong, handsome
man with a big beard, on account of which he was called Most-Beard. He
was the noblest man on the island.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the spring, Thorolf gave Bjorn a ship manned by good men, and sent
his son, Hallstein, to accompany him. They sailed west across the sea to
visit Bjorn’s relatives. When King Harald heard that Thorolf Most-Beard
had sheltered Bjorn Ketilsson, his outlaw, he sent men to him and
ordered him off his lands to wander as an outlaw, like his friend Bjorn,
unless he came and placed his case in the king’s hands. This was ten
years after Ingolf Arnarson had gone out to settle in Iceland. His
journey had become very famous because the men who came from Iceland
said that there was a good choice of land out there….</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Now the story says of Bjorn, the son of Ketil Flatnose, that he
sailed west across the sea after he and Thorolf Most-Beard had parted,
as was mentioned earlier. He made for the Hebrides and, when he arrived
in the west, his father had already died, but he met his brother, Helgi,
and his sisters. They offered him a good living with them, but Bjorn
became aware that they had adopted a new faith. It seemed mean-spirited
to him that they had abandoned the ancient faith their ancestors had
followed, so he had no desire to stay, and had no intention of
establishing a permanent residence there. However, he stayed for the
winter with his sister, Aud [Unn; see doc. 28c], and her son, Thorstein,
but when they discovered that he meant to turn a deaf ear to his
relatives, they called him Bjorn the Easterner. They took it badly that
he did not want to stay there permanently.</p></li>
<li><p>Bjorn stayed for two years in the Hebrides before he got ready to
travel to Iceland. Hallstein Thorolfsson accompanied him. They landed in
Breidafjord and, with Thorolf’s advice, Bjorn claimed land between the
Staf river and Hraunsfjord. Bjorn lived at Borgarholt in Bjorn’s Harbor.
He was the noblest of men.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Hallstein Thorolfsson thought it was unmanly to accept land from his
father, so he traveled west across Breidafjord and took land there. He
lived at Hallsteinsness. A few years later, Aud the Deep-Minded came out
to Iceland. For the first winter, she stayed with Bjorn, her brother,
and later took all the Dales district in Breidafjord, between the
Skraumuhlaups River and the Dogurdar River. She lived at Hvamm. In these
days, the whole of Breidafjord was settled, but there is no need to
mention the landtakes of men who don’t come into this story.</p>
