<h4 id="b-children-mimic-adults-aaaaaaaa">(b) Children Mimic Adults
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Viking children, like their modern counterparts, acquired much of
their learning by imitating their elders. In Brennu-Njáls saga, two
young boys take on the roles of Mord and his son-in-law, Hrut, and act
out the shameful incident where Mord refuses to fight Hrut, thus failing
to secure his divorced daughter’s dowry. (In doc. 83f, adults perform
similar dramatic parodies of legal procedings.)</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk Fornrit XIV (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 28–29.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>….Then Mord declared that he would not fight Hrut. At the law rock,
a huge whoop went up; there was a lot of shouting, and Mord was utterly
shamed. Afterwards, everyone rode home from the Thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>The brothers, Hoskuld and Hrut, rode west to Reykjadale and put up at
Lund, the home of Thjostolf, son of Bjorn Gullbera. There had been a
great deal of rain during the day; people had got very wet, and fires
had been lit. Thjostolf the householder sat between Hoskuld and Hrut.
Two boys were playing on the floor; both were dependents of Thjostolf,
and there was a girl playing with them. They were chattering on as
children do when they don’t know any better.</p>
<p>One of the boys said to the other, “I’ll be Mord and summon you to
give up your wife on the grounds that you’ve never screwed her.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be Hrut,” the other replied, “and I’ll insist that you give up
your claims to her property unless you fight me.”</p>
<p>They repeated these remarks several times causing uproarious laughter
among the people of the household. Hoskuld was furious and struck the
boy playing Mord with a switch; it caught him in the face and broke the
skin.</p>
<p>“Get out of here, and don’t make fools of us,” he said to the
boy.</p>
<p>Hrut said, “Come over here to me,” and the boy did so. Hrut drew a
gold ring from his arm and gave it to the boy.</p>
<p>“Go now,” he said, “and don’t offend like that ever again.”</p>
<p>“Your generous behavior will be an example to me forever,” replied
the boy as he left.</p>
<p>Hrut was much praised for his behavior. They traveled west on their
way home, and the quarrels with Mord and his family were now over.</p>
<ol start="3" type="a">
<li>The Child Is Mother of the Woman</li>
</ol>
<p>In all of these passages, children are a disturbing presence on the
edge of the adult world. The young Hallgerd’s eyes betray the disastrous
effect she will have on all around her in the later parts of the
saga.</p>
<p>Source: Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól. Sveinsson, Íslenzk Fornrit
XIV (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 6–7.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>…On one occasion, Hoskuld held a feast. His brother Hrut was there
and was seated next to him. Hoskuld had a daughter called Hallgerd, and
she was playing on the floor with some other girls. She was tall and
beautiful with fine silken hair that fell to her waist.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Come over here to me,” Hoskuld called out to her.</p>
<p>She did so, and Hoskuld took her by the chin and kissed her. After
she had gone away again, Hoskuld said to Hrut, “How does the girl strike
you? Don’t you think she’s beautiful?”</p>
<p>Hrut sat in silence, and Hoskuld asked his question again.</p>
<p>This time, Hrut answered. “Certainly the girl is beautiful, and many
men will pay for it, but I don’t know how thief’s eyes got into our
family.”</p>
<p>Hoskuld was furious and the brothers had little to do with one
another for a while.</p>
