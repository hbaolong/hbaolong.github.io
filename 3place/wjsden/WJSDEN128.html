<h4 id="olaf-tryggvason-and-the-conversion-of-norway-aaaaaaaa">90. Olaf
Tryggvason and the Conversion of Norway AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Olaf Tryggvason’s reign (995–1000) was brief but eventful. His
conversion of Norway to Christianity was undertaken for both political
and religious reasons, and however pious Olaf himself may have been, he
was inflexible in the mercilessness with which he carried out his
attempt to recall Norwegians to Christianity. Nonetheless, the old gods
still haunted Norway and sometimes attempted to win back the men who had
deserted them.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A. A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Óláfs saga
Tryggvasonar, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 1, pp. 302–23.</p>
<ol start="53" type="1">
<li>When King Harald Gormsson, king of Denmark, adopted Christianity, he
sent word throughout his entire kingdom that everyone should be baptized
and turn to the true faith. He himself backed the order by authorizing
force and punishment when nothing else worked. He also sent two earls to
Norway with a large army. They were to proclaim Christianity in Norway.
This was successful in the Vik, which was under Harald’s authority, and
much of the population was baptized.</li>
</ol>
<p>After Harald’s death, his son, Svein Forkbeard, went raiding both in
Saxony and Frisia, and finally in England. In his absence, the
Norwegians who had accepted baptism went back to making heathen
sacrifices as they had done before, and as was the practice in the north
of the country. When Olaf Tryggvason became king of Norway, he stayed in
the Vik for much of the summer, and many of his relatives and in-laws
joined him there. Many of them had been great friends of his father, and
they gave him a very warm welcome.</p>
<p>Then Olaf summoned his maternal uncles, his step-father, Lodin, and
his kinsmen Thorgeir and Hyrning. He suggested to them very earnestly
that they should join him and give him their full support in
establishing Christianity throughout his kingdom. He said that he would
bring about the Christianization of Norway or die in the attempt.</p>
<p>“I shall make you important and powerful men,” said Olaf, “for I have
the greatest trust in you because of our kinship and our other ties.”
They all agreed that they—and everyone willing to follow their
advice—would do whatever he asked and support him in whatever he
proposed. Olaf immediately informed all his people that he would impose
Christianity on everyone in his kingdom. Those who had been Christians
before were the first to accept the king’s bidding. They were also the
most powerful of those present, and everyone followed their example.</p>
<p>When everyone in the eastern part of the Vik was baptized, King Olaf
moved to the northern part and ordered the population there to accept
Christianity. He inflicted terrible punishments on those who opposed
him: some were killed, some were mutilated, and others were driven from
the country. So it came about, as King Olaf had ordered, that
Christianity was accepted by all the people throughout the territory
formerly ruled by his father, King Tryggvi, and also in the territory of
his kinsman, Harald Grenski. Thus, in the course of that summer and the
following winter, everyone in the Vik was converted to Christianity.</p>
<ol start="54" type="1">
<li>In early spring, King Olaf set out from the Vik with a large army
and headed west to Agder. Wherever he held a meeting with the farmers,
he gave orders for everyone to be baptized. The people submitted to
Christianity because none of the farmers dared rebel against King Olaf
and so, wherever he went, everyone was baptized.</li>
</ol>
<p>In Hordaland, there were many noble men descended from Horda-Kari. He
had four sons: first was Thorleif Spaki [the Wise]; second came Ogmund,
the father of Thorolf Skjalg [the Squinter] who was the father of Erling
from Soli; the third son was Thord, the father of Klypp the Hersir
[local chieftain, lord] who killed Sigurd the Snake, the son of
Gunnhild; the fourth was Olmod, the father of Askel, the father of Aslak
Fitjaskalli. This family was the greatest and noblest in Hordaland in
those days.</p>
<p>Now, when these kinsmen heard the troubling news—that the king was
making his way through the country from the east with a large army,
abolishing the old laws, and that everyone who resisted him had to
endure punishment and harsh treatment—then they set up a meeting to work
out their strategy, because they knew that the king would soon be upon
them. They agreed among themselves that they should all go in a great
body to the Gulathing and that they should arrange to meet King Olaf
Tryggvason there.</p>
<ol start="55" type="1">
<li>As soon as he arrived in Rogaland, King Olaf called an assembly and,
when the farmers received the summons, they gathered fully armed and in
great numbers to discuss what to do. They designated the three most
eloquent men of their number to speak against King Olaf at the assembly
and tell him that they would not submit to injustice even if the king
ordered them to do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the farmers had assembled and the meeting had begun, King Olaf
stood up and at first spoke graciously to them. However, it was clear
from his speech that he intended to make them Christians. He began by
asking them pleasantly, but concluded by saying that anyone who opposed
him and refused to submit to his commands would incur his anger and
suffer punishment and harsh treatment, wherever he could lay hands on
them.</p>
<p>After King Olaf had finished speaking, the most eloquent of the
farmers chosen to answer him stood up. However, when he tried to speak,
he began to cough and became so choked up that he could not get a word
out, so he sat down again. Then the second farmer stood up, determined
not to make a mess of his answer, even though the first man had not done
too well. But when he began his speech, he stammered so much that he
could not get a word out. Everyone who heard him started to laugh, and
so the farmer sat down. Then the third man stood up to oppose King Olaf,
but when he began speaking he was so hoarse and husky that no one could
hear what he was saying, and so he, too, sat down. Then there was no one
to speak out against the king, and when there was no opposition from the
farmers, there was no uprising against him. In the event, everyone
obeyed the king’s orders and they were all baptized before the king went
on his way.</p>
<ol start="56" type="1">
<li>King Olaf summoned his troops to the Gulathing because the farmers
had sent word to him that they would respond to his demands there. But
when both sides arrived at the assembly, King Olaf expressed a wish to
confer with the chieftains first. When they had all assembled, King Olaf
stated his purpose and required them to be baptized as he had ordered.
Then Olmod the Old replied.</li>
</ol>
<p>“We kinsmen have discussed this matter among ourselves,” he said,
“and we have all agreed on the same course of action. If it’s your
intention, king, to compel us to violate our laws and to force us into
submission, we will oppose you with all our strength, and let fate award
the victory. If, however, you are willing to do something to further our
interests, then you will succeed in winning us over to your side and
we’ll be your faithful subjects.”</p>
<p>“What are you demanding of me in return for a complete
reconciliation?” asked the king.</p>
<p>“First, that you give your sister, Astrid, in marriage to our
kinsman, Erling Skjalgsson, whom we regard as the most promising young
man in Norway,” replied Olmod. King Olaf replied that the marriage would
probably be a good one since Erling was well-born and likely to
distinguish himself, but said that the decision would be up to Astrid.
Later, the king discussed the affair with his sister.</p>
<p>“There’s not much advantage for me in being the daughter of a king
and the sister of a king,” she said, “if I’m to be given in marriage to
a commoner. I would rather wait a few years for another offer.” With
that, they ended the conversation.</p>
<ol start="57" type="1">
<li>King Olaf had one of Astrid’s hawks stolen. Then he had its feathers
plucked and sent it back to her.</li>
</ol>
<p>“My brother is angry now,” said Astrid. So she rose and went to see
the king, who greeted her affectionately. Astrid said that she would
like the king to make the decision on her behalf as he thought best.</p>
<p>“I would have thought,” said the king, “that in this land I had the
power to raise any man I wanted to the nobility.” The king summoned
Olmod, Erling, and all their kinsmen for a discussion. They talked over
the marriage offer and, as a result, Astrid was engaged to Erling. Then
the king called the assembly together and ordered the farmers to adopt
Christianity. Olmod, Erling, and their kinsmen were prominent in
supporting the king’s cause and no one had the confidence to oppose
them, so the whole population was baptized and converted to
Christianity….</p>
<ol start="59" type="1">
<li><p>Then King Olaf went to North Møre with his army and converted
that district to Christianity. Afterwards, he sailed into Hlad where he
had the temple demolished. He removed all the treasure and ornaments
from the temple and from the god; from the temple door, he took down the
great gold ring which had been made on Earl Hakon’s orders. Then King
Olaf had the temple burned down….</p></li>
<li><p>King Olaf went to Tunsberg and convened an assembly at which he
decreed that all men who were sorcerers and were known to be guilty of
practicing witchcraft and magic had to leave the country. Then the king
had the neighboring settlements searched for such men and summoned them
all before him. Among those who came was a man called Eyvind Kelda. He
was the grandson of Rognvald Rettilbein [Straight-Leg] who was the son
of Harald Finehair. Eyvind was a sorcerer and very knowledgeable about
magic.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>King Olaf had all these men put in one room which had been made ready
for them. He had a feast prepared for them and they were given strong
drink. When they were drunk, Olaf had the building set alight and the
room was destroyed by the fire along with everyone inside, except for
Eyvind Kelda, who got out through the smoke-hole and escaped. When he
had gone a good distance, he met some men who were on their way to see
King Olaf. He told them to let the king know that Eyvind Kelda had
escaped from the fire and that he would never again fall into the hands
of King Olaf. Moreover, as regards his magical lore, he would behave
exactly as he had done before. When these men met King Olaf, they told
him what Eyvind had asked them to say. The king was very annoyed that
Eyvind was not dead.</p>
<ol start="63" type="1">
<li>In the spring, King Olaf traveled out along the Vik and was
entertained at his large estates in the area. He sent word throughout
the Vik that he intended to call out an army in the summer and travel to
the north of the country. Afterwards, he went west to Agder. When Lent
was almost over, King Olaf went north to Rogaland and on Easter-eve he
arrived at Ogvaldsness on Kormt Island where an Easter feast was
prepared for him. He was accompanied by almost three hundred men. That
same night, Eyvind Kelda came to the island in a longship manned
entirely by sorcerers and other kinds of magicians. Eyvind and his men
went ashore and began using their magic spells. Eyvind covered them in
darkness with a fog so thick that the king and his men would not be able
to see them, but when they came close to the dwelling at Ogvaldsness, it
became as bright as day. Then things turned out very differently from
what Eyvind had intended. The darkness which he had created by magic
descended on Eyvind and his men so that they could see no more with
their eyes than they could with the backs of their heads and went round
and round in circles.</li>
</ol>
<p>The king’s watchmen saw them, but did not know who they were. The
king was told and he and all his companions rose and got dressed. When
the king saw Eyvind and the others wandering around, he ordered his men
to arm themselves and go to find out who these people were. The king’s
men recognized Eyvind, so they seized him and all the others and led
them before the king. Eyvind gave him an account of everything that had
happened on his journey. Then the king had them all taken to a skerry
which was covered by the sea at high tide and had them tied up there.
That is how Eyvind and his men lost their lives and, ever since, the
skerry has been called Sorcerers’ Skerry.</p>
<ol start="64" type="1">
<li>The story goes that while King Olaf was being entertained at
Ogvaldsness, an old man arrived there one evening. He wore a hood pulled
down low over his face and had only one eye. He spoke very wisely and
had something to say about every land. When he started talking, the king
found his conversation most entertaining and questioned his guest
extensively. The old man had an answer for every question, and King Olaf
sat up late into the evening with him.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then the king asked if he knew anything about that Ogvald after whom
the headland and the farm had been named. The guest replied that Ogvald
had been a great king and warrior and that he had worshipped a certain
cow more than anything else. He used to take this cow with him wherever
he went because he thought that drinking her milk every day was good for
him.</p>
<p>“King Ogvald fought against a king called Varin and fell in the
battle,” continued the guest. “He was then placed in a mound here close
to his farm, and stone monuments were erected, which are still standing.
The cow was placed in another mound nearby.” Such tales he told, and
many others about kings and events from the past.</p>
<p>When they had sat long into the night, the bishop reminded the king
that it was high time to go to bed. The king did so. But after he had
undressed and got into bed, the guest sat on the footboard and again
talked for a long time. It seemed to the king that as soon as one word
had been spoken, he was anxious to hear the next. Then the bishop said
to the king that it was time to sleep. The king did so, and the guest
left. A little later, the king woke up and inquired about his guest. He
gave orders for him to be called to his presence, but the guest was
nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Next morning, the king summoned his cook and the man who was in
charge of the drink and asked them if they had seen any stranger. They
replied that, while they were preparing the meal, a man came in and said
that they were cooking very poor meat for the king’s table. Then he gave
them two thick, fat sides of beef that they cooked along with the other
meat. King Olaf said that all the food must be destroyed because his
guest was probably not a human being, but must have been Odin, whom
heathens had worshipped for a long time. Odin, he said, would not manage
to deceive them….</p>
<ol start="67" type="1">
<li>King Olaf anchored his fleet in the river Nid. He had thirty ships
and a fine, large army; the king himself spent much of his time at Hlad
with his retinue. When the time was approaching for the sacrifice at
Maeren, King Olaf prepared a great feast at Hlad and sent invitations to
Skind, and up to Gaulardal, and out to Orkadal inviting the chiefs and
other great men to come and visit him. On the first evening, when the
guests had arrived, there was a splendid feast with plenty to eat and
drink. People got very drunk, and afterwards everyone slept peacefully
through the night. Next morning, the king dressed and heard mass, after
which he had the horns blown to summon everyone to a meeting. All his
men came ashore from the ships and made their way to the meeting and
when everything was ready, the king stood up and spoke.</li>
</ol>
<p>“We held an assembly at Frosta where I invited the farmers to have
themselves baptized,” said King Olaf, “but, in response, they invited me
to sacrifice with them, just as King Hakon, Athelstan’s foster-son, used
to do. So we agreed to meet at Maeren and offer up a great sacrifice
there. But if I am to hold a sacrifice with you, I will make it the most
important kind of sacrifice that is ever offered: I will sacrifice men.
Moreover, I am not going to pick slaves or villains. I will choose the
noblest men as gifts for the gods. To this end, I nominate Orm Lygra
from Medalhus, Styrkar of Gimsar, Kar from Gryting, Asbjorn, Thorberg
from Ornes, Orm from Lyxa, and Halldor from Skerdingstead.”</p>
<p>He named five more of the noblest men and said that he would
sacrifice them too for a good year and peace; then he had the men seized
on the spot. The farmers realized that they did not have the forces to
oppose the king, so they asked for peace, and offered to submit to him.
It was agreed among them that all the farmers who had come to Hlad would
be baptized and would promise on oath to observe the true faith and give
up making sacrifices. The king kept all these men at his banquet until
they had surrendered their sons, or brothers, or other close relatives
as hostages.</p>
<ol start="68" type="1">
<li>King Olaf advanced with his army further into the Trondheim area. By
the time he arrived at Maeren, all the chiefs from the Trondelag who
were most firmly opposed to Christianity had gathered there. With them
were all the important farmers who had formerly offered up sacrifices in
that place. There was just as big a crowd here as at the meeting in
Frosta. Then the king called for an assembly, and both sides attended
fully armed. When the meeting got under way, the king spoke and asked
them to adopt Christianity. Jarnskeggi answered the king’s speech on
behalf of the farmers, saying that the farmers’ wishes were still the
same and they did not want the king to overturn their laws.</li>
</ol>
<p>“We want you to sacrifice here, king,” said Jarnskeggi, “just as
other kings have done before you.” The farmers cheered his speech loudly
and declared that what Skeggi had said was what they wanted. The king
replied that he would enter the temple to see how they performed their
sacrifices. The farmers were pleased, and both sides entered the
temple.</p>
<ol start="69" type="1">
<li><p>King Olaf went into the temple with a few of his men and some of
the farmers. He came to where the gods were sitting, and saw Thor, the
most honored of them all, adorned with gold and silver. King Olaf raised
a gold-mounted staff he was carrying and struck Thor so that he fell
from his pedestal. Then the king’s men rushed forward and knocked all
the gods down from their pedestals. While the king was in the temple,
Jarnskeggi was killed outside the temple doors by the king’s men. When
the king rejoined his troops, he offered the farmers two choices: to
become Christian, or to fight him. After the death of Jarnskeggi, the
farmers had no leader to raise their standard against King Olaf, so they
made the choice to go to the king and do his bidding. Then King Olaf had
everyone who was there baptized and took hostages from the farmers to
ensure that they would stay Christian. After that, King Olaf sent his
men all over the Trondheim district. No one opposed Christianity and
everyone in the area was baptized.</p></li>
<li><p>Harek from Thjota left town [Nidaros] at the first opportunity,
but Hauk and Sigurd stayed with the king and were both baptized. Harek
went on his way until he arrived back home in Thjota. He sent word to
his friend, Eyvind Kinnrifa, that Harek from Thjota had met King Olaf
but hadn’t allowed himself to be bullied into becoming Christian. He
also informed him that King Olaf intended to lead an army against them
in the summer. Harek advised that they should be on their guard against
Olaf and urged Eyvind to join him as soon as possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When he received these messages, Eyvind realized that the most
pressing business was to work out how they could avoid falling into King
Olaf’s clutches. So he set off hurriedly in a light boat with only a few
men aboard. When he reached Thjota, Harek welcomed him warmly and
immediately afterwards they left the farmhouse by another way and had a
talk together. But they hadn’t been talking for long when King Olaf’s
men—the ones who had accompanied Harek to the north—seized Eyvind, led
him to their ships, and sailed off with him.</p>
<p>They did not interrupt their journey until they reached Trondheim and
found King Olaf in Nidaros. There Eyvind was brought before the king,
who urged him to be baptized like other men, but Eyvind refused. The
king and the bishop both spoke to him courteously and tried to persuade
him to accept Christianity, giving him many good reasons for doing so,
but Eyvind would not be moved. Then the king offered him gifts and great
revenues, but Eyvind refused them all. At length, the king threatened
him with torture and death, but still Eyvind would not be moved. So the
king had a basin full of red-hot embers brought in and placed on
Eyvind’s stomach. Soon his stomach burst open.</p>
<p>“Take the basin away,” said Eyvind. “I want to say a few words before
I die.”</p>
<p>This was done, and the king asked, “Now will you have faith in
Christ, Eyvind?”</p>
<p>“No, I cannot accept baptism,” replied Eyvind, “for I am a spirit,
given human life and shape by the magic of the Finns. Before then, my
father and mother could not have a child.” Then Eyvind died; he had been
a great sorcerer.</p>
