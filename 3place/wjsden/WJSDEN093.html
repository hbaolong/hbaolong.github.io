<h4 id="the-islands-in-the-northern-ocean-ca-825-aaaaaaaa">68. The
Islands in the Northern Ocean, ca 825 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Irish monk and scholar Dicuil wrote the important geographical
work Liber de Mensura Orbis Terrae [The Book on the Measurement of the
Earth] around 825. This work includes a discussion of the islands in the
northern ocean, some of which Dicuil says he had visited himself, while
for others he had his information from priests who had visited them.
Dicuil’s work thus seems to demonstrate that Irish hermits had visited
and seasonally inhabited the Faeroe Islands as well as Iceland. Thule is
generally regarded as Iceland; the modern name Faeroe Islands derives
from Faereyjar, “Sheep Islands.”</p>
<p>Source: ed. and trans. J.J. Tierney, Dicuili Liber de Mensura Orbis
Terrae (Dublin: Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1967), pp. 73,
75, 77.</p>
<p>7.6. We do not read of islands being found in the sea west or north
of Spain. There are islands around our own island Hibernia, some small
and some very small. Near the island Britannia are many islands, some
large, some small, and some medium-sized. Some are in the sea to her
south, and some in the sea to her west, but they abound mostly to the
north-west and north. Among these I have lived in some, and have visited
others; some I have only glimpsed, while others I have read about.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>Plinius Secundus [Pliny the Elder, d. 79 CE] in his fourth book
informs us that Pytheas of Marseilles states that Thule lies six days’
sail to the north of Britain.</p></li>
<li><p>About the same island, which was always uninhabited, Isidorus
[Isidore of Seville, d. 636] says in the same fourteenth book of his
Etymologiae: Thule is the farthest island of the ocean, and coming to
Thule, which shines both by day and by night under the rays of the sun,
when he ascends in his chariot to the axes of the zodiac, lighting up
the north, with his torch….</p></li>
<li><p>It is now thirty years since clerics, who had lived on the island
[Thule] from the first of February to the first of August, told me that
not only at the summer solstice, but in the days round about it, the sun
setting in the evening hides itself as though behind a small hill in
such a way that there was no darkness in that very small space of time,
and a man could do whatever he wished as though the sun were there, even
remove lice from his shirt, and if they had been on a mountain-top
perhaps the sun would never have been hidden from them….</p></li>
<li><p>There are many other islands in the ocean to the north of Britain
which can be reached from the northern islands of Britain in a direct
voyage of two days and nights with sails filled with a continuously
favorable wind. A devout priest told me that in two summer days and the
intervening night he sailed in a two-benched boat and entered one of
them.</p></li>
<li><p>There is another set of small islands, nearly separated by narrow
stretches of water; in these for nearly a hundred years hermits sailing
from our country, Ireland, have lived. But just as they were always
deserted from the beginning of the world, so now because of the Northman
pirates they are emptied of anchorites, and are filled with countless
sheep and very many diverse kinds of seabirds. I have never found these
islands mentioned in the authorities.</p></li>
