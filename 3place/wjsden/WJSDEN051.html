<h4 id="c-sigmund-sigurd-and-the-sword-gram">(c) Sigmund, Sigurd, and
the Sword Gram</h4>
<p>The Saga of the Volsungs is a prose version of the history of the
Volsung family, the descendants of King Volsung, the legendary
great-grandson of Odin. The saga includes the legends of Sigurd,
Brunhild, and the Nibelungs. The tale of the Nibelung family is the
focus of Richard Wagner’s operatic cycle The Ring of the Nibelungs. This
excerpt culminates in the slaying of Fafnir by Sigurd.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Völsunga saga, in Fornaldarsögur
Norðurlanda, ed. Guðni Jónsson, 4 vols. (Reykjavík, 1959), vol. 1,
pp. 113, 135–47, 150–56.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Once there was a king called Siggeir who ruled over Gothland in
Sweden. He was a powerful king with a large following. He went to visit
King Volsung and asked for the hand of his daughter, Signy. The king and
his sons were pleased by the proposal, but Signy was reluctant, though
she asked her father to decide this matter as he did everything else
that concerned her. The king thought that it was expedient to give her
in marriage, so she was betrothed to King Siggeir. King Siggeir was to
come to King Volsung’s court for the wedding banquet and the wedding
itself. King Volsung put his best efforts into preparing for the banquet
and, when everything was ready, King Volsung’s guests and King Siggeir’s
guests arrived on the appointed day; many noble men accompanied King
Siggeir.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is said that many large fires were lit all along the hall, and in
the middle stood the great tree, as has been mentioned already. The
story tells that when people were sitting at the fires in the evening, a
solitary man whom no one recognized walked into the hall. The man wore a
spotted coat with a hood, his feet were bare, and his legs were covered
by linen breeches. He had a sword in his hand, a wide hat on his head,
and he approached the tree in the middle of the hall. He was tall, old,
and one-eyed. He drew the sword and thrust it into the tree trunk so
that it sank in all the way to the hilt. No one offered any greeting to
the man. However, he began to address them.</p>
<p>“The man who draws this sword from the tree will receive it as a gift
from me and he will find truly that he has never had a better sword than
this in his hand.” After that, the old man left the hall, and no one
knew who he was or where he went.</p>
<p>Then they got up, and there was no hesitation about trying to take
the sword because they thought that whoever tried first would win. The
noblest men went up to the tree first, and then the others, one after
another. No one who approached the tree won the sword, for it didn’t
give an inch when they laid hold of it. Then Sigmund, the son of King
Volsung, seized the sword and drew it from the tree trunk as though he
had found it loose. The weapon seemed so excellent to everyone that they
thought they had never seen its equal. Siggeir offered three times its
weight in gold for the sword, but Sigmund replied, “You could have taken
the sword from its place just as I did, if it had been fitting for you
to carry it, but you will never do that now that the sword has come into
my possession, even if you offer all the gold you possess.”…</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Once there was a king called Eylimi, a ruler both powerful and
noble. His daughter, Hjordis, was the most beautiful and wisest of
women. King Sigmund heard that she was a match for him, if anyone was,
so he went to the home of King Eylimi who wished to honor Sigmund with a
feast, provided that he was not coming to make war. Messages passed
between them, and it was established that Sigmund’s journey was peaceful
and that he had no hostile intentions. King Eylimi had only the best
provisions for his banquet, which was attended by a large number of
guests. Markets were set up everywhere for King Sigmund and he was
provided with whatever provisions or equipment he needed for his
journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>They arrived at the feast, and the two kings shared one hall. Also at
the feast was King Lyngvi, the son of King Hunding, and he, too, wanted
to marry King Eylimi’s daughter, Hjordis. King Eylimi saw that they had
come on a single errand and he also knew that there would be
difficulties with the loser.</p>
<p>So, the king spoke to his daughter. “You are a wise woman,” said
Eylimi, “and I have told you that you must choose whom you marry. Choose
between these two kings; your decision will be mine.”</p>
<p>“This seems a difficult problem,” she answered. “However, I choose
the more famous king, and that is Sigmund, though he is stooped with
age.” Accordingly, she was promised to Sigmund and Lyngvi went away.
Then Sigmund married Hjordis and from one day to the next the
festivities grew better and more splendid.</p>
<p>Later, Sigmund, accompanied by his father-in-law, returned to Hunland
and took care of his kingdom. But King Lyngvi and his brothers gathered
an army against King Sigmund because they had always come off worst, and
the present instance was even more irritating, so they wanted to humble
the glory of the Volsungs. They advanced into Hunland and sent word to
King Sigmund that they did not want to take him unawares, and that they
did not expect him to flee. King Sigmund said that he would meet them in
battle and gathered his army. Hjordis was moved to the forests with a
maid-servant and a great deal of treasure. She remained there while the
fighting continued.</p>
<p>An overwhelming army of Vikings leapt from their ships. King Sigmund
and King Eylimi set up their standards and horns were sounded, but King
Sigmund had sounded his father’s horn to encourage his men; Sigmund had
by far the smaller army. A fierce battle developed and, though he was an
old man, Sigmund fought hard and was always at the forefront of his men.
Neither shield nor mail-shirt could withstand him and, that day, he was
so constantly engaged with his enemies’ army that no one could tell how
the conflict would turn out. Many spears and arrows were in the air, but
his guardian spirits protected him so that he was unwounded and no one
could tell the number of those who fell at his hands; both his arms were
bloodied to the shoulder.</p>
<p>After the battle had gone on for some time, a man with a broad hat
and a blue cloak entered the battle. He was one-eyed and carried a
spear. The man approached King Sigmund and thrust his spear at him. When
King Sigmund swung hard, his sword struck the spear and broke in two.
Then the tide of battle turned, for King Sigmund’s luck had deserted
him, and many of his men fell all around him. Yet the king defended
himself and urged on his men but, as the saying goes, there’s no arguing
with numbers. In this battle, King Sigmund and King Eylimi, his
father-in-law, fell at the head of their troops, most of whom
perished.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Now King Lyngvi went to the king’s residence, intent on capturing
Hjordis there, but he was disappointed for he found neither the woman
nor the treasure. He traveled all over the country and divided the
kingdom among his followers. He thought that he had exterminated the
whole race of the Volsungs and that there was no cause to fear anything
from that direction.</li>
</ol>
<p>That night, after the battle, Hjordis searched among the dead and
found where King Sigmund was lying. She asked whether he would recover.
“Many who are hardly expected to live survive,” he answered, “but my
luck has deserted me, so I won’t allow myself to be healed and Odin
doesn’t want me to raise the sword that has been broken. I won battles
as long as it pleased him.”</p>
<p>“I would be happy,” she replied, “if you got better and avenged my
father.” “That’s another man’s destiny,” answered Sigmund. “You are
carrying a man-child. Raise him well and carefully, and the boy will be
noble and the foremost of our family. Take care of the sword-fragments,
for a good sword called Gram may be made from them and our son will
carry it. The many great deeds he performs with Gram will never be
forgotten, and his name will be renowned while the world lasts. Let that
satisfy you for now. I am exhausted by my wounds and I’m going to visit
our relatives who have gone before me.”</p>
<p>Hjordis sat with him until he died and by then it was daybreak. She
saw that many ships had reached land and said to her maid-servant, “We
must change clothes, and you will go by my name and say that you are the
king’s daughter.” They did so. The Vikings were looking over the many
dead when they saw two women heading for the forest. The Vikings
realized that great events had taken place and leapt from their
ships.</p>
<p>The leader of this force was Alf, son of Hjalprek, king of Denmark,
who was sailing along the coast with his army. Then they arrived where
the dead lay, and they saw that there had been a great slaughter. The
king gave orders for the women to be brought before him, and this was
done. He asked who they were, and the answer was given by the
maid-servant, who recounted the deaths of King Sigmund, King Eylimi, and
many other great men; she explained, too, who had done this. King Alf
asked if they knew where the treasure of King Sigmund was hidden.</p>
<p>“It is to be expected that we would know,” replied the maid-servant.
She showed the way to the treasure, and they found it was a vast amount
of wealth. No one recalled ever having seen so large a treasure or so
many precious objects gathered together in one place. All of this
property was carried to Alf’s ships; Hjordis and the maid-servant
followed too. He traveled home to his own kingdom and said that the most
famous kings had fallen there. The king stayed at the steering oar,
while the women sat just before the quarter deck. He talked to them, and
found their opinions worth listening to.</p>
<p>King Alf, the most accomplished of kings, arrived back in his own
kingdom with the treasure. When they had been there for a little while,
the king’s mother asked, “Why has the more beautiful of these women
fewer rings and inferior clothes? In my estimation, you have ranked the
better woman as inferior.”</p>
<p>“I have suspected,” he replied, “that she did not have the bearing of
a maid-servant, and when we met, she greeted honorable men with ease.
We’ll put them to the test.” One day, when they were drinking, the king
started a conversation with the women and asked, “How do you recognize
that it is daybreak and the night has gone if you see no sun in the
sky?”</p>
<p>The servant answered, “When I was young, I used to drink a great deal
at dawn; I’ve given up the habit, but I still waken because of it, and
that is how I recognize morning.” The king laughed at that answer and
said, “Poor behavior for a King’s daughter!”</p>
<p>He turned to Hjordis and asked her the same question. “My father gave
me a little ring,” she answered, “and it had the property of turning
cold on my finger at dawn.”</p>
<p>“A lot of gold for a maid-servant to carry,” he said. “You have
hidden yourself from me for long enough. I would have treated you as if
we had been children of the same king if you had told me this from the
beginning. But I shall treat you even more honorably, for you will be my
wife and I shall pay you a dower when you bear me a child.” In reply,
she told him the whole truth about her condition and she stayed there in
great honor and seemed the most worthy of women.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>At this point in the story, Hjordis gave birth to a boy, and the
child was taken to King Hjalprek. The king was delighted when he saw the
boy’s bright eyes and declared that there would never be anyone like
him, or equal to him in any way. The child was sprinkled with water and
named Sigurd. Everyone had the same opinion: that there was no one to
match him in character or physique. He was brought up by King Hjalprek
with great affection, and whenever the noblest men and kings are named
in the old sagas, Sigurd always comes first for his strength, his
accomplishments, his energy, and his valor; he was more highly endowed
with these qualities than anyone else in the northern regions of the
world. So, Sigurd grew up with King Hjalprek and King Hjalprek betrothed
Hjordis to his son, King Alf, and paid the bride-price.</li>
</ol>
<p>Regin, son of Hreithmar, was Sigurd’s foster father. He taught Sigurd
the accomplishments that were expected of kings’ sons: how to play
chess, how to read runes, how to speak several languages, and many other
things as well. One day when they were together, Regin asked Sigurd if
he knew how much property his father had owned and who was managing it.
Sigurd replied that the kings were looking after it.</p>
<p>“Do you trust them completely?” asked Regin. Sigurd answered, “It’s
only right that they should look after it until I am fit to do so, for
they know how to take care of it better than I do.”</p>
<p>On another occasion, Regin approached Sigurd and said, “It’s odd that
you don’t mind being the kings’ stable boy and going about like a
tramp.” “That’s not how things are,” said Sigurd. “We talk over
everything together, and I get whatever I want.” “Ask for a horse,
then,” said Regin. “I’ll get one the minute I want it,” answered
Sigurd.</p>
<p>Then Sigurd went to the king. “What do you want?” asked Hjalprek. “I
would like a horse to ride,” replied Sigurd. “Then choose yourself a
horse and anything else of mine that you’d like,” said the king.</p>
<p>So next day, Sigurd went to the forest where he met an old man with a
long beard. The stranger asked Sigurd where he was off to. “I have to
choose a horse,” said Sigurd. “Can you give me any advice?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go and drive the horses to the river Busiltjorn,” said the old
man. So they drove the horses deep into the river. All but one of them
returned to land, and that was the one Sigurd chose. The horse was a
young gray, big and handsome—no one had ever ridden him.</p>
<p>“This horse is descended from Sleipnir,” said the bearded man, “and
he must be carefully reared, for he will be better than any other
horse.” With that, the man vanished. Sigurd called the horse Grani, and
it was the best horse ever…. Odin was the old man whom he had met.</p>
<p>On another occasion, Regin said to Sigurd, “You haven’t got nearly
enough money, and it upsets me to see you running about like a peasant
boy. But I can tell you where there’s a great treasure to be found;
you’ll gain fame if you go looking for it, and even more if you get hold
of it.” Sigurd asked where it was and who was guarding it.</p>
<p>“The guardian of the treasure is called Fafnir,” replied Regin, “and
he lives not far from here at a place called Gnitaheath. When you get
there, you’ll have to admit that you have never seen more gold in one
place. You will never need more even if you live to be the oldest and
most famous of kings.”</p>
<p>“I may be young,” said Sigurd, “but I have heard what sort of dragon
this is, and I have also heard that no one dares to attack him because
of his size and his malevolence.”</p>
<p>“That’s not so,” answered Regin, “he’s only about the size of a
heathsnake, but he’s made out to be much bigger than he really is—that’s
what your ancestors would have thought. But even though you are one of
the Volsungs, it doesn’t look as if you have their spirit and courage,
for their reputation for heroic deeds is unsurpassed.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps I don’t have much of their courage and prowess,” replied
Sigurd, “but there’s no need to taunt me. I’m scarcely more than a
child. Why are you goading me like this?”</p>
<p>“There’s a story about that,” said Regin, “and I’ll tell it to you.”
“Let me hear it,” said Sigurd.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>“The story begins with my father, Hreithmar,” said Regin. “He was a
great man and a wealthy one, and he had three sons: the first was
Fafnir, the second was Otter, and I was the third. I was the least
handsome and accomplished of the sons, but I knew how to work with iron,
silver, and gold, and I could make a variety of useful items. My
brother, Otter, had a different nature and occupation. He was a
first-rate huntsman—much better than anyone else—for during the day he
assumed the shape of an otter and was constantly in the river, catching
fish and carrying them ashore in his mouth. He brought his catch to his
father, and it was a great help to him. My brother spent much of his
time in otter-shape; then he would come home late and eat alone with his
eyes closed, for he could not see on dry land. Fafnir was by far the
biggest and fiercest of the three of us, and he coveted everything for
himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>“There was a dwarf named Andvari,” continued Regin, “who spent all
his time in a waterfall called Andvari’s waterfall. There, he took on
the shape of a pike and caught his food, for fish were plentiful. Otter,
too, was always in that waterfall, catching fish in his mouth and laying
them on the bank, one at a time.</p>
<p>“Odin, Loki, and Hoenir were on a journey and came to Andvari’s
waterfall just when Otter had caught a salmon and was eating it on the
river bank with his eyes closed. Loki hurled a stone at him and killed
him. The Aesir were delighted with their catch and flayed the otter’s
pelt. That evening, they visited Hreithmar and showed him what they had
caught. At the sight of the skin, he seized them and demanded
compensation and ransom for Otter. They were to fill his skin with gold
and then cover it up completely with more gold. Loki was sent to procure
the gold, so he went to Ran and stole her fishing net. Then he went to
Andvari’s falls and cast the net in front of the pike. The pike leapt
into the net and Loki said:</p>
<p>’What fish is this</p>
<p>that swims in the river</p>
<p>and cannot protect itself?</p>
<p>redeem your head,</p>
<p>from death,</p>
<p>find gold for me.’</p>
<p>’I am Andvari;</p>
<p>my father is Oinn;</p>
<p>I frequent waterfalls;</p>
<p>long ago</p>
<p>a wretched norn [one of the Fates]</p>
<p>shaped my fate,</p>
<p>made me swim in water.’</p>
<p>“Then Loki was shown Andvari’s gold, and Andvari handed it all over,
except for one ring. But Loki took this ring from him, too. Then the
dwarf retreated to a cave, warning that the ring and all the rest of the
gold as well would spell death for whoever owned it.</p>
<p>“The Aesir brought the gold to Hreithmar and stuffed the otter’s hide
with it. Then they stood the hide on its feet and covered it up with
gold. When that was done, Hreithmar went over to the skin. He noticed a
single whisker sticking out and ordered the Aesir to cover it up too. So
Odin drew the ring, Andvari’s Gift, from his hand and covered the
whisker. Then Loki said:</p>
<p>’Gold is now given;</p>
<p>you have a large</p>
<p>payment for my head.</p>
<p>But happiness</p>
<p>is not fated for your son;</p>
<p>the gold is death for both of you.’</p>
<p>“Later,” said Regin, “Fafnir murdered his father. I got none of the
gold, for Fafnir became so mean that he took to lying outside and would
allow no one but himself any share in the treasure. Eventually, he
became a terrible dragon and, to this day, still lies on the treasure.
After a while, I made my way to the king and became his smith. The
upshot of my story is that I lost both the inheritance from my father
and the compensation for my brother. And it’s because of this story that
gold has been known ever since as ‘Otter’s Ransom.’”</p>
<p>“You have lost a great deal,” said Sigurd, “and your kinsmen have
been very wicked. But now, if you wish me to kill that mighty dragon,
use all your skill to make me a sword of matchless quality so that I can
perform great feats with it if my courage is equal to the task.” “I’ll
do it,” said Regin, “and I’m confident you’ll be able to kill Fafnir
with the sword.”</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>Regin forged a sword and placed it in Sigurd’s hands. Sigurd took
the sword and saying, “This is your forging, Regin!,” he struck the
anvil and shattered the sword. Then he threw the sword away and ordered
Regin to forge a better one. So Regin made another sword and brought it
for Sigurd’s inspection.</li>
</ol>
<p>“This sword should please you,” said Regin, “even though you’re a
hard taskmaster.” Sigurd tested the sword, but it broke just like the
first one. “You’re just like your kinsmen before you,” said Sigurd to
Regin. “You can’t be relied on.”</p>
<p>Sigurd now went to see his mother. She greeted him joyfully, and they
talked and drank together. Then Sigurd asked, “Is the rumor true? Did
King Sigmund give you the sword, Gram, in two pieces?”</p>
<p>“It’s true,” she replied. “Give the pieces to me,” said Sigurd. “I
want them.” So she gave him the sword, saying that he would probably win
fame with it.</p>
<p>Sigurd went to Regin and told him to make the best sword he could
from the pieces. Regin was angry—he felt that Sigurd was concerning
himself too much with the forging. Nevertheless, he went into the smithy
with the pieces and made a new sword out of them, and when he drew it
from the hearth it seemed to his workmen that fire was blazing from its
edges. Regin told Sigurd to take the sword, saying that he didn’t know
how else to make him a sword if this one broke. So Sigurd took it and
struck the anvil and split it all the way down to the base without
breaking or shattering the sword itself. Sigurd was full of praise for
the sword. He went down to the river with a lock of wool and threw it in
against the current. The wool sheared in two when it met the sword.</p>
<p>Sigurd went home happy. Then Regin said to him, “Now that I have made
you a sword, you must fulfill your promise to kill Fafnir.” “I will,”
said Sigurd….</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li>Now Sigurd and Regin rode across the heath to the path which Fafnir
usually slithered along when he went to the water. People say that the
cliff on which Fafnir lay down to drink was thirty fathoms above the
water. “Regin, you told me that this dragon was no bigger than a
heath-snake,” said Sigurd, “but his tracks seem huge to me.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Dig yourself a hole and sit in it,” said Regin, “and when he crawls
to the water, strike him to the heart and kill him. You’ll win a lot of
glory that way.”</p>
<p>“But what will happen if I get in the way of the dragon’s blood?”
asked Sigurd.</p>
<p>“There’s no point in giving you advice if you’re afraid of
everything,” said Regin. “You don’t have the courage of your
kinsfolk.”</p>
<p>Sigurd rode to the heath, but Regin, who was very frightened, turned
back. Then Sigurd dug a hole, and, as he was doing so, an old man with a
long beard came up to him and asked what he was doing there. Sigurd told
him. “That’s not a great idea,” replied the old man. “You should dig
several holes for the blood to run into; then you can sit in one of them
and strike at the serpent’s heart.”</p>
<p>With that, the old man vanished and Sigurd dug the holes as he had
been advised.</p>
<p>When the dragon slithered toward the water, the earth quaked
violently and the ground shook all around him. He blew out poison all
over the path in front of him, but Sigurd was neither frightened nor
dismayed by the din. As soon as the serpent crawled over his hole,
Sigurd thrust his sword under its left shoulder and it went in right up
to the hilt. Then Sigurd leapt up from his hole and pulled out the
sword; his arms were bloodied right up to the shoulder. When the great
serpent felt its death wound, it lashed out with head and tail, and
everything in its path was destroyed.</p>
<p>After he had received his death wound, Fafnir asked Sigurd, “Who are
you? Who is your father and who are your kinsfolk that you are brave
enough to take up weapons against me?”</p>
<p>“No one knows who my family is,” answered Sigurd. “I am called ‘Noble
Beast’; I have neither father nor mother and I have come here all
alone.”</p>
<p>“If you have neither father nor mother,” said Fafnir, “what miracle
produced you? You know that you are lying, although you won’t tell me
your name on this my dying day.”</p>
<p>“My name is Sigurd,” he replied, “and Sigmund was my father.” “Who
goaded you into doing this deed,” asked Fafnir, “and why did you allow
yourself to be persuaded? Hadn’t you heard that everyone is afraid of me
and my helmet of terror? Bright-eyed youth, you had a brave father.”</p>
<p>“My own fierce courage incited me to this deed and helped me to carry
it out,” replied Sigurd. “So too did this strong arm and this keen sword
with which you are now familiar. Few men are brave in maturity who have
been timid in their youth.”</p>
<p>“I know that you would have been able to fight in anger if you had
grown up surrounded by your family,” said Fafnir, “but I find it strange
that a captive would have had the courage to attack me, for few
prisoners-of-war are brave in a fight.”</p>
<p>“Are you reproaching me for being far from my kinsmen?” said Sigurd.
“I may have been a captive, but I was never in fetters—you yourself have
found out that I was free.”</p>
<p>“You are taking offence at everything I say,” said Fafnir, “but,
beware, the treasure that was mine will be the cause of your death too.”
“Everyone wishes to keep all his treasure till his dying day,” said
Sigurd, “but everyone has to die sometime.”</p>
<p>“You won’t pay much attention to my advice,” said Fafnir, “but, if
you put to sea unwarily, you will be drowned, so stay on land until the
weather is calm.” Then Sigurd said, “if you are so wise, Fafnir, tell me
this: who are the norns who deprive mothers of their sons?”</p>
<p>“There are many norns,” replied Fafnir, “and they are not all alike:
some are of Aesir race, some are of Elf race, and some are daughters of
Dvalin.”</p>
<p>“What is the name of the island where Surt and the Aesir will mingle
their blood?” asked Sigurd.</p>
<p>“Its name is Oskapt [Uncreated],” answered Fafnir. Then he continued,
“My brother, Regin, has brought about my death, and it gratifies me that
he will bring about your death too, for things are going to happen just
as he wished.”</p>
<p>Fafnir went on, “When I was lying on my brother’s inheritance, I wore
a helmet of terror to instill fear in everyone and I spewed poison all
around me so that no one dared approach. I feared no weapon, and however
mighty were the men I encountered, I always knew that I was much the
stronger; everyone was afraid of me.”</p>
<p>“The helmet of terror that you mentioned gives victory to few,” said
Sigurd, “because anyone who comes into contact with lots of other
people, will find out sooner or later that no one man is braver than all
the rest.”</p>
<p>“My advice to you is to get on your horse and ride away as quickly as
possible,” said Fafnir, “for it’s often the case that someone who
receives a death wound will avenge himself.”</p>
<p>“Keep your advice,” said Sigurd. “I’ve got other plans. I’m going to
ride to your den and seize the great treasure that belonged to your
kinsmen.”</p>
<p>“Ride there then,” replied Fafnir, “and you will find enough gold to
last you for the rest of your days, but that same gold will kill you and
anyone else who owns it.”</p>
<p>Then Sigurd stood up and said, “I would ride home and give up that
great treasure if I knew that I would live forever, but every brave man
wants to enjoy as much wealth as possible till his dying day. As for
you, Fafnir, lie there in your death throes until Hel [goddess of death]
carries you off.” Then Fafnir died.</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li>After that, Regin came to Sigurd. “Hail, my lord,” he said, “you
have won a great victory by defeating Fafnir, for before you came along,
no one was brave enough to lie in wait in his path. This heroic act will
be remembered as long as the world lasts.” After that, Regin stood
staring at the ground for a long time; suddenly, he spoke with great
passion.</li>
</ol>
<p>“You have killed my brother,” he said, “but I can hardly be
considered guiltless.”</p>
<p>Sigurd took his sword, Gram, wiped it dry on the grass, and said,
“Regin, you fled a long way off while I carried out this deed and tested
this sharp sword with this strong arm. I had to contend with the might
of the dragon while you were hiding in the heather, not knowing whether
you were in heaven or on earth.”</p>
<p>“This dragon might have lain in his den for a long time if you had
not made use of the sword I made for you with my own hands,” said Regin,
“and without the sword, neither you nor anyone else would have managed
to kill him yet.”</p>
<p>Sigurd replied, “When it comes to fighting, a man is better off with
a stout heart than a sharp sword.” Then Regin said to Sigurd with great
sorrow, “You have killed my brother, but I can hardly be considered
guiltless.”</p>
<p>Afterwards, Sigurd cut out the dragon’s heart with a sword called
Ridil. Regin drank Fafnir’s blood and said, “Do me a small favor,
Sigurd: take the heart to the fire, roast it, and let me have it to
eat.”</p>
<p>Sigurd roasted the heart on a spit, and when the juices began to run,
he tested the meat with his finger to see if it was done. Then he put
his finger in his mouth and as soon as the blood from the serpent’s
heart touched his tongue, he was able to understand the speech of birds.
He heard some nuthatches chirping in the nearby bushes.</p>
<p>“There sits Sigurd roasting Fafnir’s heart,” said one. “He should eat
it himself and then he would be wiser than anyone else.” “There lies
Regin, intending to betray the man who trusts him,” said the second.
“Sigurd should cut his head off,” said the third. “Then he would be sole
owner of all that gold.” The fourth said, “Sigurd would be wise to
follow this advice. Afterwards he should go back to Fafnir’s lair, get
hold of the treasure, and ride up to Hindarfell where Brunhild is
sleeping. He will gain great wisdom there. He would be wise to take this
advice and consider his own needs. For, when I see a wolf’s ears, I
expect a wolf.” “He isn’t as wise as I thought, if he spares the man
whose brother he has just killed,” said the fifth. “It would be a good
idea for Sigurd to kill Regin and became sole owner of the treasure,”
said the sixth.</p>
<p>“It won’t be my ill fate to be killed by Regin,” said Sigurd.
“Instead, both brothers will go the same way.” With that, he drew the
sword, Gram, and cut off Regin’s head.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he ate some of the dragon’s heart, and saved the rest.
Then he leapt on his horse and followed Fafnir’s tracks to his den,
which stood open; all the doors and the door fastenings were made of
iron, and the beams were iron too. The lair itself had been dug down
into the earth. There, Sigurd found a huge quantity of gold and the
sword, Hrotti. There, too, he got the helmet of terror, a gold
mail-shirt, and many other precious objects. In fact, he found so much
gold that he doubted whether two or even three horses could carry it
away. He took all the gold and put it into two large chests. Then he
took his horse, Grani, by the reins, but the horse would not budge and
it was useless to whip it. Then Sigurd realized what the horse wanted:
he leapt onto its back, pricked it with the spurs, and the horse ran as
if it had no load.</p>
