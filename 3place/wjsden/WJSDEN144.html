<h4 id="the-decline-of-the-earls-of-orkney">109. The Decline of the
Earls of Orkney</h4>
<p>By the end of the twelfth century, the earls of Orkney—who a century
earlier had been all but independent rulers in the Northern Isles and
mainland of Scotland with a far-reaching sphere of influence (see doc.
106)—were beginning to experience the abridgement of their power by both
Norwegian and Scottish monarchies bent on consolidation of their own
influence. Earl Harald Maddadarson (d. 1206) was the son of Maddad the
earl of Atholl and his second wife, a daughter of Earl Hakon Paulsson of
Orkney. Harald came to power amid a maelstrom of dynastic strife in
1139, at the age of five, and took sole control of the earldom in 1159.
From then until the end of his life he pursued a policy of expansion and
consolidation of power in the north of Scotland that brought him into
direct conflict with the Scottish kings. The chief source of information
on Earl Harald is Orkneyinga saga, the later chapters of which recount
the earl’s conflicts with the Scottish king William I the Lion (r.
1165–1214). The dating of these clashes with the Scottish king must be
worked out from other sources, but they occurred in the period between
1196 and 1201. Harald had already been deprived of Shetland in 1195 by
the king of Norway.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Orkneyinga saga, ed. Finnbogi
Guðmundsson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXIV (Reykjavík, 1965), pp. 289–98.</p>
<ol start="109" type="1">
<li>Earl Harald Maddadarson now ruled the Orkneys and was a great
leader. He made a second marriage, to Hvarflod, the daughter of Malcolm,
Earl of Moray. Their children were Thorfinn, David, John, Gunnhild,
Herborg, and Langlif….</li>
</ol>
<p>Eirik Stay-Brails had three sons: they were Harald the Young, Magnus
Mangi, and Rognvald. These brothers went east to Norway to visit King
Magnus Erlingsson [King Magnus V, 1156–84] and he gave Harald the title
of earl and the right to rule over half of the Orkneys, as his
grandfather Rognvald the Holy had done before him. Earl Harald the Young
sailed west, and with him went Sigurd the Tiny, son of Ivar Fault, who
was killed with Erling Wry-Neck at Aker. Ivar’s mother was the daughter
of Havard Gunnason. Sigurd the Tiny was a young man, very promising, and
a flashy dresser. Magnus Mangi stayed behind with the king and died with
him at Sogn.</p>
<p>Harald the Young and his men landed first in the Shetlands. From
there, they went to Caithness and then south into Scotland to meet
William, king of Scots. Harald asked the king to give him the half of
Caithness that Earl Rognvald had ruled, and the king did so. From there,
Harald went north to Caithness and set about gathering troops. He was
joined by his brother-in-law, Lifolf the Bald, who had many noble
kinsmen in the area. Lifolf was married to Ragnhild, the sister of Earl
Harald the Young; he was called “Harald the Young” to distinguish him
from Harald Maddadarson, who was nicknamed “the Old.”</p>
<p>Lifolf had more influence over Harald the Young than anyone else. He
and Harald sent messengers to Earl Harald the Old in the Orkneys asking
him to hand over half of the islands, in fulfillment of King Magnus’s
promise to Earl Harald the Young. When Harald the Old heard about this,
he flatly refused to divide his territory on any terms. Lifolf the Bald
took part in this mission, and, before he left, Harald the Old spoke to
him in a very threatening manner.</p>
<p>After that, Earl Harald the Old mustered a large army. Meanwhile,
Harald the Young and his followers were in Caithness and they had
assembled a small number of troops. When they heard that Harald the Old
was gathering an army together, they dispatched Lifolf north once again
across the Pentland Firth to reconnoiter the enemy. He headed west to
Ranaldsey and climbed a hill where he came across three of Harald the
Old’s lookouts. They killed two of them but kept the third for
interrogation. Then Lifolf caught sight of the earl’s forces—he had many
ships, most of them big. So Lifolf returned to his ship and told his
companions what he had found out.</p>
<p>He declared that Earl Harald’s army was so large that it would be
folly to take him on. “To my way of thinking,” said Lifolf, “we should
head north today for Thurso where lots of people will join us. But if
you insist on fighting Earl Harald, it is bound to be disastrous.”</p>
<p>Then Sigurd the Tiny spoke up: “It’s a black day when the earl’s
brother-in-law crosses the Pentland Firth and leaves his nerve behind,”
he said, adding that it would be a sorry outlook if they were all to
lose heart as soon as they saw Harald the Old’s army.</p>
<p>“When push comes to shove, Sigurd,” replied Lifolf, “it’s hard to
tell who will keep his nerve. And I’m pretty sure that if it ever came
time for me to desert Harald the Young, you fine fellows would be hard
put to it to stay behind.”</p>
<p>The trip to Thurso did not take place, and a little later on they saw
Harald the Old’s fleet sailing off Ranaldsey, so they prepared for
battle. Harald the Old came ashore and drew up his considerable forces,
while Sigurd the Tiny and Lifolf got the young earl’s army into
position. Sigurd the Tiny was wearing a scarlet tunic with the front
skirts tucked up under his belt. Some of his men suggested doing the
same at the back, but he told them not to bother: “For I’ve no intention
of turning tail today,” he said.</p>
<p>Sigurd and Lifolf were each with their own wings of the army and, as
soon as they had drawn up their troops, a fierce battle began. In Harald
the Old’s force, there were many tough men who were really hard fighters
and unusually well-equipped—men such as the bishop’s kinsmen and many of
the other troop leaders. Some time into the battle, Sigurd the Tiny fell
fighting bravely, as befits a warrior. Lifolf did better than anyone
else in the battle; the men of Caithness say that he went right through
Harald the Old’s lines three times, before dying heroically. When both
Lifolf and Sigurd the Tiny were dead, the young earl’s army took to
flight.</p>
<p>Earl Harald the Young died beside some peat pits, and that night a
great light was seen where his blood had fallen. People claim that the
earl was truly saintly; a church now stands where he died. He is buried
on the headland, and, on account of his virtues, many miracles have been
performed there by God, as an indication that he wanted to cross over to
Orkney to be with his kinsmen, Earl Magnus and Earl Rognvald.</p>
<p>After the battle, Earl Harald brought the whole of Caithness under
his control. Then he went straight to Orkney, boasting of his great
victory.</p>
<ol start="110" type="1">
<li>William, king of Scots, heard that Harald the Young was dead and
that Harald Maddadarson had taken over the whole of Caithness without
consulting him. The king was furious and sent messengers to Rognvald
Gudrodarson, king of the Hebrides. Gudrod’s mother was Ingibjorg, the
daughter of Earl Hakon, who was the son of Earl Paul. In those days,
King Rognvald was the greatest warrior in the British Isles. For three
years he had lived aboard his warships without once coming under a sooty
roof.</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as the king’s message reached him, Rognvald raised an army
from all over the Hebrides and Kintyre; he also had a large force from
Ireland. Then he headed north for Caithness and established control over
the whole area. He remained in Caithness for some time, while Earl
Harald stayed in the Orkneys, paying no attention to Rognvald’s
movements.</p>
<p>As winter approached, King Rognvald prepared to return to his kingdom
in the Hebrides. He left three stewards behind in Caithness; one was
Mani Olafsson, the second was Rafn the Lawman, and the third was called
Hlifolf the Elder. Shortly after King Rognvald’s return to the Hebrides,
Earl Harald sent a man over to Caithness, telling him that his mission
would be a success if he managed to kill one or more of the
stewards.</p>
<p>The man crossed the Pentland Firth and traveled on until he met Rafn
the Lawman who asked him where he was going. He hadn’t much to say for
himself, so Rafn said to him, “I can see in your face that Earl Harald
has sent you here on some nasty business, but you are my kinsman, and I
can’t bring myself to kill you.”</p>
<p>With that they parted and the fellow went away to find Hlifolf, whom
he murdered. Then he hurried back to Orkney and told Earl Harald what he
had done.</p>
<ol start="111" type="1">
<li>Earl Harald prepared to leave the Orkneys, and, when he was ready,
traveled south to Thurso where he disembarked. Bishop John was in the
fort at Scrabster, and when the men of Caithness saw how large Harald’s
army was, they realized that they could not stand up to it. They had
also heard that Earl Harald was in such a foul temper that there was no
saying if he would show them any mercy. Then the bishop said,</li>
</ol>
<p>“If the earl and I meet on civil terms, then he will spare you.” The
bishop’s view was generally accepted.</p>
<p>The earl’s men rushed from their ships and made for the fort. The
bishop went to meet the earl and greeted him pleasantly, but Earl
Harald’s response was to have the bishop seized, and his tongue cut out,
and a knife thrust into his eyes so that he was blinded.</p>
<p>As he was being mutilated, Bishop John called on the holy maiden,
Saint Tredwell, and when they let him go, he walked to a hillside where
he met a woman and asked her for help. She saw that blood was pouring
from his face and said, “Calm yourself, my lord; I’ll be glad to help
you.” She led the bishop to Saint Tredwell’s resting place and there his
speech and sight were both restored.</p>
<p>Earl Harald then advanced on the fort and they surrendered it to him
immediately. He inflicted severe punishments and imposed huge fines on
the people who had been most prominent in the treason against him. Once
more, he made all the people of Caithness swear allegiance to him
whether they liked it or not. Then he seized all the property that had
belonged to the stewards who had fled to the king of the Scots.
Afterwards, he stayed on in Caithness with a large force.</p>
<ol start="112" type="1">
<li>Now, to return to the stewards, six of them decided to go south to
Scotland. They met the king there at the Yule festival and were able to
give him a clear account of what had happened in Caithness in the course
of Earl Harald’s campaign. The king was very angry about these events,
and declared that he would give the stewards property worth double the
value of what they had lost. On their first day with the king of Scots,
each of them received twenty-five ells [an English ell is 1.143 meters]
of cloth and one English mark [160 silver pennies] to cover their
expenses. They spent Yule with the king of Scots in high favor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Immediately after Yule, the king of Scots sent word to all the
chieftains in his kingdom, and levied a large army from every region of
the land. He led this huge army north to Caithness to attack Earl Harald
and halted at Eysteinsdale, which is on the border between Caithness and
Sutherland. The king’s tents stretched from one end of the valley to the
other, and that is a considerable distance.</p>
<p>Earl Harald was in Caithness when he got this news and he called out
his own forces without delay. It is said that he had six thousand men,
but even this force wasn’t large enough to withstand the king of Scots,
so he sent representatives to the king to explore the possibility of
reaching a settlement. The king responded that there was no point in
negotiations, unless he was awarded a quarter of the income from
Caithness. On receiving this message, Earl Harald called a meeting of
landowners and other leading men and asked for their advice. In view of
their situation, the men of Caithness agreed to pay a quarter of their
property to the king of Scots; those who had sought out the king earlier
in the winter were exempted.</p>
<p>Earl Harald went back to the Orkneys with an agreement that he was to
rule all of Caithness just as he had before Harald the Young received it
from the king of Scots. During the hostilities, Thorfinn, the son of
Harald, had been taken hostage by the king of Scots and blinded. Once
peace terms had been agreed, the king traveled south to Scotland and
Earl Harald remained as sole ruler of the Orkneys.</p>
<p>Toward the end of Earl Harald’s life, Olaf, his son-in-law, and John
Hallkelsson raised troops in the Orkneys and headed east to Norway to
oppose King Sverrir [ca 1145–1202]. The man they had chosen for king was
Sigurd, the son of King Magnus Erlingsson. Many high-born men from the
Orkneys joined their force, which was an exceedingly strong one. At
first, they were called the Islanders and then, for a while, the
Gold-Legs. They fought against King Sverrir at Floravoe [in 1194] and
lost. Both John and Olaf were killed there, along with their king and
most of their army.</p>
<p>After that, King Sverrir grew very hostile toward Earl Harald,
claiming that it was all his fault that an army had been raised in the
Orkneys. As a consequence, the earl and Bishop Bjarni went east to
Norway, where Harald submitted to King Sverrir and asked him to settle
their differences. Then King Sverrir took the whole of Shetland away
from Earl Harald, along with all its taxes and dues. The earls of Orkney
have never regained those islands.</p>
<p>Harald was five years old when he was given the title of earl. For
twenty-two years he was joint-earl of Orkney with Earl Rognvald the Holy
and, after Rognvald’s death, he was sole earl for forty-eight years. He
died in the second year of the reign of King Ingi Bardarson [in 1206],
and after his death, his sons John and David inherited the earldom; his
son Henry ruled Ross in Scotland.</p>
<p>According to some writers, the most powerful earls of Orkney were
Sigurd Eysteinsson, Earl Thorfinn Sigurdarson, and Earl Harald
Maddadarson. After their father’s death, the brothers John and David
held the earldom jointly until David died of an illness in the same year
as Hakon the Mad died in Norway [1214]. After that, John became sole
ruler of the Orkneys.</p>
