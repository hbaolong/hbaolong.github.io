<h4 id="the-great-ships-of-king-hakon-iv">35. The Great Ships of King
Hakon IV</h4>
<p>By the middle of the thirteenth century, Norwegian politics had grown
more tranquil, and the demand for the construction of massive ships like
the Mariasud dwindled. However, for campaigns in Denmark and an
expedition to Scotland in 1263, King Hakon IV had three great ships
built which were said to have been the biggest ever constructed in
Norway. The Saga of Hakon the Old was written in the 1260s by the
Icelandic historian and chieftain Sturla Thordarson (1214–84), nephew
and pupil of Snorri Sturluson. Hakon’s son, Prince Magnus, is said to
have commissioned the saga from Sturla. This saga is the main source for
Norwegian history from 1217 to 1263. Sturla’s historical writings are
unusual in that they frequently record events contemporary with the
writer (see doc. 110).</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Icelandic Sagas and Other
Historical Documents Relating to the Settlements and Descents of the
Northmen of the British Isles, vol. II, Hákonar Saga, with Fragment of
Magnus Saga, with Appendices, ed. G. Vigfusson (Rolls Series: London,
1887), pp. 175–76, 273, 293–94.</p>
<ol start="197" type="1">
<li><p>Next morning, after he had heard mass, King Hakon sailed along
the coast of Jadar. As they approached Hvin, the steering oar on the
king’s ship broke, and almost the whole blade snapped off, but by using
the gangplanks and the oars, they steered the ship south around the
headland. When they had cleared the headland, they laid aside the
gangplanks and steered into Skerdadarsound using the remains of the
steering oar as well as the regular oars. The damaged steering oar was
brought ashore when they came into port, and it seemed astonishing that
such a large ship had been steered by such a small fragment of
rudder….</p></li>
<li><p>…Then a great force flocked to King Hakon, from around the Vik
and from the north of the country. King Hakon was aboard the Olafssud
and the young king had the Dreki [Dragon]. Earl Knut brought the
Dragsmark, Sigurd the king’s son had the Rygjabrand, Peter from Gizki
had the Borgundarboat, and Ogmund Kraekidance [Crow-dance] had the
Gunnarsboat. Bard from Hestby commanded a large ship and there were also
many other good-sized ships. King Hakon headed into Hervidar Sound, and
most of his forces joined him there.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>From Hervidar Sound, he set out for Hrafnsholt. There, on its stocks,
stood the great ship built on his instructions by his kinsman, Gunnar.
The ship was one of the biggest ever built in Norway. The king had her
launched, and the launch went well. In an eloquent speech, the king
named the ship Krosssud. After the ceremony, King Hakon left some men
behind to fit out the ship, while he himself went to join the rest of
his fleet. Then he sailed south to Ekrey, where he ordered most of the
fleet to lie at anchor.</p>
<p>The kings and most of the landed-men boarded small ships and headed
in to the Elf River, anchoring at a place called Lindisholm. Then King
Hakon heard that Earl Birgir had arrived with the Swedish army, just as
they had planned earlier….</p>
<ol start="278" type="1">
<li>King Hakon sent his son, Prince Magnus, and Gaut from Mel to fetch
the Krosssud from the north and sail her to join the other large ships
at Ekrey. When they arrived in the north, they completed whatever
preparations were still needed to fit out the ship. Before they sailed
from Hrafnsholt, the prince made his first official speech, and everyone
admired its eloquence and the maturity of its delivery.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then they headed for Ekrey. When they entered the harbor and dropped
anchor, the momentum of the ship was so great that fire broke out in the
windlass around which the cable was wound. The fear was that the rope
would burn, so they soaked an awning, intending to stifle the fire with
it, but Prince Magnus was much quicker and more resourceful. He lifted
up a tub full of drink, poured it over the windlass, and cooled down the
cable.</p>
<p>When the Krosssud was berthed alongside the other ships, her sides
were as high as the awning pole of the Olafssud. The sides of the
Krosssud stood nine ells [a Norwegian ell was 62.8 cm] above sea-level,
and she was by far the biggest of all the ships there. The general
opinion was that this number of great ships had never been seen together
in one harbor. Many terrible tales about this levy and fleet spread all
over Danish territory, and resistance seemed out of the question. Sturla
puts it this way:</p>
<p>Sea-King, I speak of how you repaid</p>
<p>the strife of the Danes in the south.</p>
<p>Far and wide from fir-rollers</p>
<p>your people launched lithe ships;</p>
<p>many conscripts were called out</p>
<p>by your freemen, ruler of fleets,</p>
<p>for long campaigns along the coast.</p>
<p>It was the largest of levies.</p>
<p>The renowned ruler’s men</p>
<p>rushed to their rowlocks.</p>
<p>You sailed south,</p>
<p>lord, with a large fleet;</p>
<p>the folk of Halland feared</p>
<p>your power, ring-giving prince.</p>
<p>Fear of Norway’s king filled</p>
<p>the Jutish lord’s land.</p>
<ol start="291" type="1">
<li>King Hakon got ready to travel from Tunsberg to Denmark aboard the
Mariasud, a dragon-ship with thirty rowers’ benches. She was the most
elegant ship ever built in Norway with gilding on the animal heads and
on the bow and stern. The sail was decorated with beautiful pictures.
King Hakon had many other splendid, well-built ships, and, in the
sunshine, it seemed as though the beaks, weather vanes, and the gilded
shields next to the bows and sterns were on fire. As Sturla said:</li>
</ol>
<p>Glorious pictures in fiery gold</p>
<p>were seen on your sail, Gold-giver.</p>
<p>The bright gold beaks</p>
<p>shone above your dragon-ship;</p>
<p>beaten gold burned from</p>
<p>the shields on your ships;</p>
<p>across the gilded fleet, gold</p>
<p>reddened shields at stem and stern.</p>
<p>When everything was ready, King Hakon and his army sailed from
Tunsberg, east across the Fold [Oslo Sound] and a large force joined him
from the eastern side of the fjord. While Hakon was sailing east, the
ship belonging to Thorir Grepsson and Bard Groson collided with
Archbishop Einar’s ship, and the collision swept away everything on
Einar’s ship between the stern and midships. The decorated stern and the
shields next to it finished up in the sea, but the weather vanes stuck
in the sail of the other ship, which sailed away with them. The
archbishop sent out a boat to pick up the stern and the shields. The
stern was fixed securely in place and the shields were put back on the
sides of the ship. Then he sailed south to Ekrey to meet the king. When
the king discovered that the archbishop’s ship had been damaged, he was
very displeased. However, some people said that the ship had been less
damaged than the archbishop’s men claimed. When the archbishop heard
about this, he had the stern removed and it drifted along the
coast….</p>
