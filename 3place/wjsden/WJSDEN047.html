<h4 id="d-grettir-fights-a-berserk-aaaaaaaa">(d) Grettir Fights a
Berserk AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Grettis saga Ásmundarson,
ed. Guðni Jónsson, Íslenzk fornrit VII (Reykjavík, 1936),
pp. 135–37.</p>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li>At Yule, Grettir came to the farm of a landowner called Einar. He
was a wealthy man who had a wife and a daughter of marriageable age,
named Gyrid. Gyrid was a beautiful woman and was regarded as an
excellent match. Einar invited Grettir to stay with him over the Yule
season and Grettir accepted.</li>
</ol>
<p>In those days, over much of Norway, there were bandits and criminals
who would emerge from the forests and challenge men to fight for their
women. They would also seize their property by force when there weren’t
enough men to resist them. One day in Yule, a gang of these ruffians
turned up at Einar’s. Their leader, Snaekoll, was a great, big berserk.
He challenged Einar to hand over his daughter, or defend her, if he
thought he was man enough. Now Einar was past the prime of life and not
used to fighting. He knew that he had a serious problem on his hands and
asked Grettir in private what he would advise.</p>
<p>“For you have a great reputation,” he said. Grettir told Einar not to
consent to anything that he thought dishonorable.</p>
<p>The berserk was sitting on his horse, wearing a helmet with the
cheekguards unfastened, and carrying an iron-rimmed shield. His demeanor
was terrifying.</p>
<p>“Be quick. Make your choice one way or the other,” he said to the
landowner. “What does that big fellow standing beside you advise? Does
he want some sport with me?”</p>
<p>“Farmers like Einar and me are much of a muchness,” said Grettir.
“For neither of us is keen on fighting.”</p>
<p>“You’ll be really terrified of fighting me if I get angry,” said
Snaekoll. “We won’t know that till we put it to the test,” said
Grettir.</p>
<p>The berserk thought that all this talk was just a delaying tactic, so
he began to howl loudly and bite the rim of his shield. Raising the
shield to his mouth, he grimaced horribly over the rim as though he was
mad. Grettir hurled himself forward until he drew level with the
berserk’s horse. Then he kicked the bottom of Snaekoll’s shield so hard
that it ripped through his mouth, shattering his jaw; the jaw bones fell
down to his chest. At one and the same time, Grettir grasped the
Viking’s helmet with his left hand and pulled him off his horse, while
with his right hand he drew his short sword, struck the berserk on the
neck, and beheaded him. When Snaekoll’s followers saw what had happened,
they fled in all directions. Grettir didn’t bother to chase them because
he could see that they were a spiritless bunch.</p>
<p>Einar thanked Grettir for what he had done and so did many other
people. Everyone thought that he had acted with presence of mind and
courage in the affair. Grettir stayed there all through Yule, and was
entertained handsomely. When he left, Einar gave him many gifts. Then
Grettir traveled east to Tunsberg where he met Thorstein, his brother.
Thorstein welcomed him warmly and asked about his adventures,
particularly about his killing of the berserk. Grettir recited a
poem:</p>
<p>A quick kick</p>
<p>shoved the shield</p>
<p>straight into Snaekoll’s</p>
<p>menacing mouth;</p>
<p>the iron-bound buckler</p>
<p>tore the tooth-wall in two;</p>
<p>the jaw’s broken bones</p>
<p>dropped down to his breast.</p>
<p>Thorstein said, “You’d be successful in all sorts of ways, Grettir,
if you weren’t hounded by bad luck.”</p>
<p>“Still, what I’ve done will be remembered,” replied Grettir.</p>
