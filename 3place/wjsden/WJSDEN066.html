<h4 id="alcuins-letter-to-king-athelred-793">40. Alcuin’s Letter to King
Athelred, 793</h4>
<p>The sack of the monastery of Lindisfarne on the east coast of England
on 8 June 793 (described in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, doc. 39 above)
prompted the churchman and scholar Alcuin (d. 804) to write a series of
letters in which he criticized the Northumbrian king, people, and
churchmen for misconduct, which, he argued, had brought the wrath of God
upon them.</p>
<p>Source: English Historical Documents c. 500–1042, ed. D. Whitelock
(London: Eyre andandandand Spottiswoode, 1955), pp. 775–77.</p>
<p>To the most beloved lord King Ethelred and all his chief men, Alcuin
the humble deacon, sends greeting.</p>
<p>Mindful of your most sweet love, O men my brothers and fathers, also
esteemed in Christ the Lord; desiring the divine mercy to conserve for
us in long-lasting prosperity our land, which it once with its grace
conferred on us with free generosity; I do not cease to warn you very
often, my dearest fellow-soldiers, either with words, when present, if
God should grant it, or by letters when absent, by the inspiration of
the divine spirit, and by frequent iteration to pour forth to your ears,
as we are citizens of the same country, the things known to belong to
the welfare of an earthly kingdom and to the beatitude of an eternal
kingdom; that the things often heard may be implanted in your minds for
your good. For what is love in a friend, if it is silent on matters
profitable to the friend? To what does a man owe fidelity, if not to his
fatherland? To whom does he owe prosperity, if not to its citizens? We
are fellow-citizens by a two-fold relationship: sons of one city in
Christ, that is, of Mother Church, and natives of one country. Thus let
not your kindness shrink from accepting benignly what my devotion is
eager to offer for the welfare of our country. Do not think that I
impute faults to you; but understand that I wish to avert penalties.</p>
<p>Lo, it is nearly 350 years that we and our fathers have inhabited
this most lovely land, and never before has such terror appeared in
Britain as we have now suffered from a pagan race, nor was it thought
that such an inroad from the sea could be made. Behold, the church of
St. Cuthbert spattered with the blood of the priests of God, despoiled
of its ornaments; a place more venerable than all in Britain is given as
prey to pagan peoples. And where first, after the departure of Saint
Paulinus from York, the Christian religion in our race took its rise,
there misery and calamity have begun. Who does not fear this? Who does
not lament this as if his country were captured? Foxes pillage the
chosen vine, the heritage of the Lord has been given to the Gentiles;
the holy festivity has been turned to mourning.</p>
<p>Consider carefully, brothers, and examine diligently, lest perchance
this unaccustomed and unheard-of evil was merited by some unheard-of
evil practice. I do not say that formerly there were no sins of
fornication among the people. But from the days of King Ælfwold
fornications, adulteries, and incest have poured over the land, so that
these sins have been committed without any shame and even against the
handmaids dedicated to God. What may I say about avarice, robbery,
violent judgments?—when it is clearer than day how much these crimes
have increased everywhere, and a despoiled people testifies to it.
Whoever reads the Holy Scriptures and ponders ancient histories and
considers the fortune of the world will find that for sins of this kind
kings lost kingdoms and peoples their country; and while the strong
unjustly seized the goods of others, they justly lost their own.</p>
<p>Truly signs of this misery preceded it, some through unaccustomed
things, some through unwonted practices. What portends the bloody rain,
which in the time of Lent in the church of St. Peter, prince of the
apostles, in the city of York, which is the head of the whole kingdom,
we saw fall menacingly on the north side from the summit of the roof,
though the sky was serene? Can it not be expected that from the north
there will come upon our nation retribution of blood, which can be seen
to have started with this attack which has lately befallen the house of
God?</p>
<p>Consider the dress, the way of wearing the hair, the luxurious habits
of the princes and people. Look at your trimming of the beard and hair,
in which you have wished to resemble the pagans. Are you not menaced by
terror of them whose fashion you wished to follow? What also of the
immoderate use of clothing beyond the needs of human nature, beyond the
custom of our predecessors? The princes’ superfluity is poverty for the
people. Such customs once injured the people of God, and made it a
reproach to the pagan races, as the prophet says: “Woe to you, who have
sold the poor for a pair of shoes,” that is, the souls of men for
ornaments for the feet. Some labor under an enormity of clothes, others
perish with cold; some are inundated with delicacies and feastings like
Dives clothed in purple, and Lazarus dies of hunger at the gate. Where
is brotherly love? Where the pity which we are admonished to have for
the wretched? The satiety of the rich is the hunger of the poor. That
saying of our Lord is also to be feared: “For judgment without mercy to
him that hath not done mercy.” Also we read in the words of the blessed
Peter: “The time is that judgment should begin at the house of God.”</p>
<p>Behold, judgment has begun, with great terror, at the house of God,
in which rest such lights of the whole of Britain. What should be
expected for other places, when the divine judgment has not spared this
holy place? I do not think this sin is theirs alone who dwell in that
place. Would that their correction would be the amendment of others, and
that many would fear what a few have suffered, and each say in his
heart, groaning and trembling, “If such great men and fathers so holy
did not defend their habitation and the place of their repose, who will
defend mine?” Defend your country by assiduous prayers to God, by acts
of justice and mercy to men. Let your use of clothes and food be
moderate. Nothing defends a country better than the equity and godliness
of princes and the intercessions of the servants of God. Remember that
Hezekiah, that just and pious king, procured from God by a single prayer
that a hundred and eighty-five thousand of the enemy were destroyed by
an angel in one night. Likewise with profuse tears he averted from him
death when it threatened him, and deserved of God that fifteen years
were added to his life by this prayer.</p>
<p>Have decent habits, pleasing to God and laudable to men. Be rulers of
the people, not robbers; shepherds, not plunderers. You have received
honors by God’s gift; give heed to the keeping of his commands, that you
may have him as a preserver whom you had as a benefactor. Obey the
priests of God; for they have an account to make to God, how they
admonish you; they as interceders for you, you as defenders of them.
But, above all, have the love of God in your hearts, and show that love
by keeping his commandments. Love him as a father, that he may defend
you as sons. Whether you will or not, you will have him as a judge. Pay
heed to good works, that he may be propitious to you. “For the fashion
of this world passeth away”; and all things are fleeting which can be
seen or possessed here. This alone from his labor can a man take with
him, what he did in alms-giving and good works. We must all stand before
the judgment-seat of Christ, and each must show what he did, whether
good or evil. Beware of the torments of hell, while they can be avoided;
and acquire for yourselves the kingdom of God and eternal beatitude with
Christ and his saints in eternal ages.</p>
<p>May God both make you happy in this earthly kingdom and grant to you
an eternal country with his saints, O lords, my dearest fathers,
brothers and sons.</p>
