<h4 id="b-grettirs-fight-with-glam-aaaaaaaa">(b) Grettir’s Fight with
Glam AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Frequently, the dead insist on hanging around and making themselves
extremely unpleasant. In this passage from Grettir’s Saga, the hero
meets the draugr (walking dead, ghost), Glam, in a fight to the
death.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Grettis saga Ásmundarson,
ed. Guðni Jónsson, Íslenzk fornrit VII (Reykjavík, 1936),
pp. 107–23.</p>
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li>There was a man named Thorhall who lived at Thorhallsstead in
Forsaeludale [Shadow Valley], south of Vatnsdale. He was the son of
Grim, who was the son of Thorhall, who was the son of Fridmund, who was
the first settler of Forsaeludale. Thorhall married a woman called
Gudrun, by whom he had a grown-up son and daughter, Grim and Thurid.
Thorhall was a very prosperous man. The bulk of his wealth was in
livestock and no one else had as many animals as he did. Though he was
not a chieftain, he was a respectable landowner.</li>
</ol>
<p>His farm was haunted, so he had difficulty finding a competent
shepherd. He asked many experienced men what he should do, but no one
could give him any useful advice. Thorhall had good horses, and rode to
the Althing every summer. One year at the Althing, he visited the booth
of Skapti Thoroddson, the law-speaker. Skapti was a very knowledgeable
man who gave good advice to those who consulted him. The difference
between Skapti and his father was that Thorodd had the second sight and
it was rumored that he was not to be trusted, whereas Skapti gave
everyone whatever advice he thought would serve them best, as long as
they followed it. For this reason, Skapti was called ‘His Father’s
Better.’</p>
<p>Thorhall went into Skapti’s booth. Skapti knew that Thorhall was a
prosperous man, so he welcomed him warmly and asked for his news. “I
want your advice,” said Thorhall. “I’m not too great at giving advice,”
replied Skapti. “But what’s your problem?”</p>
<p>“My problem is this,” said Thorhall. “I don’t have much luck keeping
shepherds. Some get hurt; others don’t stay to finish their contracts.
Now, no one who’s aware of the situation will take on the job.”</p>
<p>“There must be some threatening presence about the place if men are
more reluctant to look after your cattle than other people’s,” said
Skapti. “But since you’ve asked my advice, I’ll get you a shepherd. His
name is Glam and he’s a Swede from Sylgsdale who came to Iceland last
summer. He’s big and strong, but not very popular.”</p>
<p>Thorhall said that that wasn’t a problem as long as Glam looked after
the sheep properly. Skapti added that there wasn’t much prospect of
finding another shepherd if someone as strong and brave as Glam didn’t
work out. After that, Thorhall left the booth; this was toward the end
of the Althing.</p>
<p>Thorhall noticed that two of his pale-colored horses were missing, so
he went out looking for them and because he went himself, people thought
he was a man of little importance. His search took him up toward the
Sletha Ridge and then south along Armannsfell mountain. There he saw a
man coming down from Godi’s Wood with a load of firewood on his horse.
When they met, Thorhall asked him his name and the man said he was
called Glam. He was a big, odd-looking man with gray, staring eyes, and
wolf-gray hair. Thorhall was taken slightly aback when he saw him, but
he realized that this was the very man who had been recommended to
him.</p>
<p>“What kind of work are you best at?” asked Thorhall. Glam answered
that he was good at taking care of sheep in winter.</p>
<p>“Will you look after my sheep?” asked Thorhall. “Skapti has placed
you at my disposal.”</p>
<p>“You’ll get the best work out of me if I’m my own boss,” said Glam,
“for I’m bad-tempered when I don’t get my way.”</p>
<p>“That won’t bother me,” said Thorhall. “I’m anxious for you to come
to my farm.” “That’s fine by me,” said Glam, “but are there any
problems?”</p>
<p>“The place seems to be haunted,” replied Thorhall. “I’m not afraid of
ghosts,” said Glam. “Besides, they’ll make life more interesting.”</p>
<p>“That’s the sort of attitude you’ll need,” said Thorhall. “And it’s
just as well you’re not a weakling.” They agreed that Glam would come at
the beginning of winter and with that they parted. Thorhall found his
horses just where he had been looking for them. Then he rode back and
thanked Skapti for his assistance.</p>
<p>As summer passed, Thorhall heard not a word of his shepherd, and no
one knew anything about him, but at the agreed time he showed up at
Thorhall’s farm. The farmer greeted him warmly, but no one else took to
him, least of all Thorhall’s wife. Glam took charge of the sheep. This
wasn’t much of an effort for him, since he had a deep, resonant voice
and the sheep flocked together whenever he shouted “hoh.”</p>
<p>There was a church at Thorhallsstead, but Glam wouldn’t go near the
place, because he disliked the chanting and was not a believer. He was
ill-tempered and malicious and was universally detested.</p>
<p>Now, when Christmas Eve came around, Glam got up early and demanded
his food. “It’s not customary for Christians to eat today,” replied
Thorhall’s wife. “Tomorrow is the first day of Christmas, and so today
it’s our duty to fast.”</p>
<p>“You have lots of superstitions that don’t add up to anything, as far
as I can see,” said Glam. “And people don’t seem to be doing any better
now than they were before when they didn’t bother with this sort of
stuff. In my opinion, our way of life was better when people were called
heathens. I want my food now, so don’t give me the runaround.”</p>
<p>“I know for certain,” said Thorhall’s wife, “that you’re in for
something terrible today if you commit this sin.” Glam told her to bring
the food immediately or it would be the worse for her. She didn’t dare
say no. Afterwards, when he had eaten, he stormed out.</p>
<p>The weather was poor. There was a general gloom and the air was
filled with blowing snow, driven by a howling gale. Conditions got worse
as the day went on. The shepherd’s voice could be heard in the morning,
but less clearly later on. The snow began to drift and in the evening a
blizzard blew up. People went to mass and night fell, but there was no
sign of Glam. They talked about mounting a search for him, but because
of the snowstorm and the utter darkness, no search took place.</p>
<p>Glam failed to come home on Christmas Eve. So, when the service was
over and there was sufficient daylight, some men set out to look for
him. They found sheep scattered far and wide in the snow drifts; some
had been injured in the storm, while others had run off into the hills.
High up in the valley, they came across a large area where the ground
had been trampled. It seemed as though there had been a violent
struggle, for rocks and earth had been kicked up all over the place.
They looked around carefully and saw Glam lying a short way off. He was
dead. His body was as black as hell, and bloated to the size of an ox.
They were repelled by the sight and shuddered with horror. Even so, they
tried to carry him to the church, but they could get no further than the
edge of a gully a little way down.</p>
<p>So they left the body where it was and went back to tell the farmer
what had happened. He asked them what could have killed Glam. They said
that they had followed some footprints as big as barrel bottoms. The
footprints led from the trodden area to the crags at the head of the
valley, and large splatters of blood dotted the trail. They concluded
that Glam had been killed by the creature which had haunted the farm
earlier, and that he had wounded it. The wound must have been fatal for
the creature was never seen again.</p>
<p>On the second day of Christmas, they made another attempt to move
Glam’s body to the church. Draft animals were harnessed to the corpse,
but when the land leveled off and ceased to slope downwards, they
couldn’t move it at all. Again, they left the body where it was and went
home.</p>
<p>On the third day of Christmas a priest went with them but, though
they searched all day, they couldn’t find Glam. The priest wouldn’t go
looking a second time and, as soon as he left, the shepherd was found.
So they gave up the struggle to carry him to the church and buried him
where he was under a pile of stones.</p>
<p>Before long, people became aware that Glam was not resting in peace.
This had terrible repercussions; many men fainted at the sight of him,
and some were driven out of their minds. Soon after Christmas, the
farm-folk thought that they saw Glam around the farm again. They were
terrified, and many fled from Thorhallsstead. Next, he took to sitting
astride the roofs at night and riding them so violently that he nearly
wrecked them with his heels. Then he started walking about both by day
and night. People hardly dared go up the valley, even if they had urgent
business. The local people thought that this was a great affliction.</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li>In the spring, Thorhall hired new servants and started farming his
land again. As the days lengthened Glam appeared less frequently; and so
time passed until midsummer. That summer, a ship put in at Hunavatn. On
board, was a foreigner called Thorgaut who was big and powerful, with
the strength of two men. He was alone in the world, with nothing to tie
him down, and he was also penniless, so he was looking for work.
Thorhall rode to the ship and asked Thorgaut if he would work for him.
Thorgaut said he would, and added that he wasn’t choosy about the kind
of work he did.</li>
</ol>
<p>“You’ll have to be ready to encounter the ghosts who have been
hanging around my farm for some time,” said Thorhall. “I don’t want to
mislead you; this job isn’t for weaklings.”</p>
<p>“I can’t see myself being upset by a few little ghosts,” replied
Thorgaut. “If I’m afraid, then no one’s going to find this an easy job.
I won’t break my agreement just for that.” So they quickly struck a deal
and Thorgaut was hired to look after the sheep during the winter. The
summer passed and winter began. Thorgaut took charge of the sheep and
everyone liked him. Glam kept coming back and riding the roofs, but
Thorgaut thought this was hilarious.</p>
<p>“The rogue will have to come closer if I’m to be frightened,” he
said. Thorhall warned him not to say too much. “It will be best if the
two of you avoid confrontation,” he said.</p>
<p>“One thing’s for sure,” said Thorgaut, “you people have had all the
nerve shaken out of you. I’m not going to drop dead some night because
of idle chatter like this.”</p>
<p>Winter passed and soon it was Christmas again. On Christmas Eve when
the shepherd was on his way out to see to his sheep, Thorhall’s wife
said, “Let’s hope there won’t be a repetition of what happened last
year.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Thorgaut. “If I don’t come back, then
there will be something worth worrying about.” After that, he went back
to his sheep.</p>
<p>The weather was cold and it was snowing heavily. Thorgaut usually
returned at dusk, but on this occasion he didn’t come back at the
expected time. The people went to church as usual, but everyone had the
feeling that events were taking a familiar course. Thorhall wanted to
search right away, but the others refused, saying that they wouldn’t
risk falling into the hands of trolls at night. The farmer didn’t dare
go out either, so there was no search.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day, after a meal, searchers went out to look for the
shepherd. They went first to Glam’s grave, for they thought that the
shepherd’s disappearance must have been his doing. When they reached the
grave, they saw a dreadful sight. There was the shepherd with his neck
broken and every bone in his body shattered. They carried Thorgaut to
church, and afterwards he caused no one any harm. Glam, on the other
hand, went from strength to strength; he caused so much havoc that
everyone abandoned Thorhallsstead, except the farmer and his wife.</p>
<p>Thorhall’s cowherd had been with him for a long time and he didn’t
want to lose him, partly because he liked the man and partly because he
did his job well. The cowherd was old, and thought that moving would be
too much of an effort. He realized, too, that the farmer’s possessions
would all be ruined if no one was there to look after them.</p>
<p>One morning after midwinter, the farmer’s wife went out to the byre
to milk the cows at the usual time. By then it was broad daylight, for
no one dared go outside earlier than that except the cowherd, who went
out at first light. She heard a huge crash and a hideous bellowing in
the cowhouse, so she ran back indoors shrieking that something dreadful
was going on in the byre. The farmer went out and saw that his cattle
were goring one another. This looked bad enough, but when he went into
the byre, he found the herdsman lying on his back with his head in one
stall and his feet in another. Thorhall went over to the cowherd, felt
him, and discovered right away that he was dead; his back had been
broken on the stone wall between the stalls. The farmer now realized
that he couldn’t stay there any longer, so he fled from his farm taking
with him whatever he could. Glam killed all the livestock that was left
behind and afterwards he traveled around the whole valley, laying waste
to every farm as far as the Tung River. Thorhall stayed with relatives
for the rest of the winter. No one dared go up the valley with a horse
or a dog, for it would be killed straightaway.</p>
<p>In spring, when the days grew longer, the hauntings became fewer.
Thorhall wanted to go back to his land and, though he had trouble
finding servants, he started farming again at Thorhallsstead. Everything
happened exactly as it had before; when autumn returned, the hauntings
increased. The farmer’s daughter was the main target of the haunting,
and finally she died of it. Many measures were tried, but none worked.
Everyone thought that all Vatnsdale would be deserted if no remedy could
be found.</p>
<ol start="34" type="1">
<li>Now the story returns to Grettir Asmundarson. He stayed at home in
Bjarg that autumn after he had parted from Killer-Bard at Thoreyargnup.
When winter was very close, Grettir set off north over the ridges to
Vididale and spent the night at Audunarstead. Audun and Grettir settled
all their differences. Grettir gave Audun a fine ax and they agreed to
be friends. Audun lived at Audunarstead for a long time and was blessed
with many descendants. His son was Egil who married Ulfheid, the
daughter of Eyolf Gudmundarson. Their son was Eyolf, who was killed at
the Althing; Eyolf was father of Orm, Bishop Thorlak’s chaplain.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grettir rode north to Vatnsdale and paid a visit to his maternal
uncle, Jokul Bardarson, who lived at Tung. Jokul was a big, strong man
and extremely overbearing. He was a seafarer, and a man of some
importance, but very quarrelsome. He welcomed Grettir, who stayed there
for three nights. Glam’s hauntings were the main topic of conversation.
Grettir asked detailed questions about everything that had happened and
Jokul told him that the stories were all true.</p>
<p>“Are you interested in going there?” asked Jokul. Grettir said that
he was, but Jokul asked him not to.</p>
<p>“You would be pushing your luck to the limit, and your relatives have
a lot to lose as well,” said Jokul. “For, at the moment, we don’t seem
to have any young man to equal you. Only evil can come from having to do
with the likes of Glam; it’s much better to take on human beings than
monsters like him.”</p>
<p>Grettir said that he really wanted to visit Thorhallsstead to find
out what was going on. “I see there’s no point in trying to stop you,”
said Jokul. “But it’s a true saying that luck and talent don’t always go
together.”</p>
<p>“There’s trouble at your own door once it enters your neighbor’s
house,” said Grettir. “You should be thinking about what could happen to
you before this is over.”</p>
<p>“It may be,” replied Jokul, “that we can both see into the future,
but neither one of us can change it.” With that, they parted; neither
was pleased with the other’s prophecies.</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>Grettir rode to Thorhallsstead. The farmer welcomed him warmly and
asked him where he was off to. Grettir replied that he’d like to spend
the night there if the farmer had no objection. Thorhall said that he
would be grateful for Grettir’s presence.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Not many people think that staying here for any length of time is a
good idea,” said Thorhall. “You must have heard talk about our
misfortune here, and I don’t want you getting into trouble on my
account. Even if you get away safely yourself, I know for sure that you
will lose your horse because no one who comes here can keep his animal
safe.”</p>
<p>Grettir answered that there were plenty more horses, if anything
happened to this one. Thorhall was delighted that Grettir wanted to stay
and welcomed him with open arms. Then Grettir’s horse was locked up
securely in the stable and they both went to bed. The night passed
without a visit from Glam.</p>
<p>“Your stay has clearly done some good,” said Thorhall, “because every
night, as you can see, Glam usually rides the roofs or breaks down
doors.”</p>
<p>“Then there are two possibilities,” said Grettir. “Either he won’t
restrain himself much longer, or he’ll hold off for more than one night.
So I’ll stay on for another night and see how it goes.” Then they went
to check Grettir’s horse, and found it unharmed. The farmer thought that
everything was pointing in the same direction.</p>
<p>So Grettir stayed for a second night and the creature did not return.
Thorhall thought that this was a promising sign. He went to look at
Grettir’s horse, but when he got to the stable, it had been broken into.
The horse had been dragged outside and every bone in its body was
broken. He told Grettir what had happened and begged him to save
himself.</p>
<p>“If you wait for Glam, you’re dead,” said Thorhall.</p>
<p>“A look at the creature is the least I can expect as compensation for
my horse,” Grettir said. The farmer replied that he would gain nothing
from seeing Glam.</p>
<p>“For he doesn’t look at all human,” said Thorhall. “But every hour
you are willing to stay here is a blessing to me.”</p>
<p>The day passed and when bedtime came, Grettir didn’t take off his
clothes but lay down on the raised wooden floor [a low platform used for
sitting and sleeping] opposite the farmer’s closet-bed. He covered
himself with a shaggy fur cloak, tucking one end under his feet and the
other end behind his head so that he could look out through the
neck-hole. He braced his feet against a sturdy plank which ran along the
edge of the raised floor where he was lying. The frame of the outer door
had been wrenched away and a hurdle had been tied roughly in place as a
makeshift door. The partition which had once divided the hall from the
entry-way had been broken away, both above and below the cross-beam. All
the bedding had been scattered about, and the place looked
uninhabitable.</p>
<p>That night, they kept a light burning in the hall. About a third of
the way through the night, Grettir heard a terrific racket outside.
Something climbed onto the house and rode on the hall roof, beating it
with its heels till every beam in the house groaned. This went on for a
long time. Then the something came down from the roof, moved toward the
door, and thrust the hurdle aside. Grettir saw the creature sticking its
head into the house. The head was a monstrous size with gargantuan
features.</p>
<p>Glam advanced cautiously through the doorway, straightening up when
he got inside; he towered all the way to the roof. Turning toward the
hall, he rested his arms on the crossbeam and thrust his head into the
room. Thorhall didn’t make a sound because he thought he’d heard quite
enough noise coming from outside. Grettir lay still and didn’t move a
muscle. Glam saw something lying in a heap on the raised floor, so he
made his way into the hall and snatched the cloak violently. Grettir
braced his feet against the partition and did not give way. Glam pulled
a second time with much more force and still the cloak did not move. The
third time he heaved so hard with both hands that he pulled Grettir up
from the floor and the cloak was torn in two between them. Glam looked
at the torn piece in his hand and wondered who could have pulled against
him so strongly. At that instant, Grettir darted under Glam’s arms,
grabbed him around the waist, and pressed against his backbone as hard
as he could, hoping to bring Glam to his knees. But Glam wrestled
against Grettir’s arms so violently that Grettir had to release his grip
and retreat. He fled from one bed-space to the next. In the pursuit, all
the planking was wrenched from its place and everything in their path
was demolished.</p>
<p>Glam wanted to get outside, but Grettir resisted by digging in his
heels wherever he could. In the end, however, Glam managed to drag him
out of the hall. Then they had a tremendous struggle because the
creature wanted to haul him out of the farmhouse, but Grettir saw that,
however difficult it was to deal with Glam indoors, it would be worse
outside, so he struggled with all his strength against going out. When
they got to the entry way, Glam strained with all his might and pulled
Grettir toward him. Realizing that resistance was getting him nowhere,
Grettir threw himself as hard as he could into the creature’s arms, and
at the same time thrust with his feet against a stone embedded in the
ground at the doorway. Glam was taken completely by surprise. He had
been pulling hard, trying to drag Grettir toward him, but now he buckled
at the knees and flew backwards out through the door. His shoulders tore
the lintel away and the roof fell apart, both the beams and the frozen
thatch.</p>
<p>So Glam fell out of the door, flat on his back, with Grettir on top
of him. The Moon was shining brightly, but was hidden now and again by
thick clouds. At the very moment when Glam fell out of the house, the
clouds cleared and he glared up fiercely at Grettir. Grettir himself has
said that this was the only sight that ever terrified him. Then
everything got too much for Grettir. What with his own weariness and the
horrible rolling of Glam’s eyes, he felt so faint that he could not draw
his short sword but lay there suspended between this world and the next.
Glam showed that he had more evil power than other ghosts when he spoke
these words:</p>
<p>“Grettir, you have put a lot of effort into finding me, but don’t be
surprised if it doesn’t bring you much luck. Let me tell you something:
you have now achieved only half the strength and vigor that would have
been yours in the future if you had not met up with me. I can’t take
away the strength you already have, but I can make sure that you will
never be stronger than you are now, though you are quite strong enough,
as many will find to their cost. Until now, your deeds have brought you
fame, but in the future they will lead to outlawry and slaughter, and
almost everything you do will bring you bad luck and misfortune. You’ll
be an outlaw, and your fate will be to live shelterless and alone
forever. And now I lay this curse upon you: these eyes of mine will
always be before you, so you will find it intolerable to be alone, and
that is what will kill you.”</p>
<p>When the creature had finished speaking, the weakness that had
overcome Grettir left him. He drew his short sword, beheaded Glam, and
placed the head down at his crotch. Then the farmer came outside. He had
got dressed while Glam was talking, but did not dare come any nearer
till he was dead. Thorhall praised God and thanked Grettir for defeating
this foul spirit. Then they went to work and burned Glam to ashes.
Afterwards, they carried the ashes away in a leather bag and buried them
far from pastures and thoroughfares. After that, they went home in the
early dawn.</p>
<p>Grettir lay down as he was very stiff, but Thorhall sent for men from
the nearest farms to show and tell them what had happened. Everyone who
heard about Grettir’s deed was overawed by it. The general opinion was
that Grettir Asmundarson had no equal in the entire country for
strength, courage, and every other accomplishment. Thorhall sent Grettir
on his way with costly gifts. He gave him a good horse and fine clothes
because the ones he had been wearing had been torn to shreds. They
parted on very friendly terms.</p>
<p>Grettir rode to As in Vatnsdale where Thorvald welcomed him warmly
and asked him for all the details of his fight with Glam. Grettir told
him everything and said that he had never experienced such a trial of
strength as their long struggle had been. Thorvald told him to behave
with restraint.</p>
<p>“If you do, you’ll be alright; if you don’t, you’ll come to
grief.”</p>
<p>Grettir said that his temper hadn’t improved; he had less
self-control than before and took offence more readily now. In this way,
too, he was changed: he was so afraid of the dark that he didn’t dare go
anywhere alone at night, for all sorts of monsters appeared to him then.
Since that time, it has become a common saying that people are “lent
Glam’s eyes” or “given Glam’s sight” when they see things otherwise than
as they are.</p>

<p>Women in the Viking Age</p>
<p>The legal and social position of women was not straightforward in the
Viking Age. The rise of Christianity is sometimes regarded as having
deprived women of earlier liberties. This may be partly true, in the
matter of divorce for example, but the Church did teach that marriage
required the consent of the woman. In theory, at least, this removed
some of the power of male relatives over women. Nevertheless, both
before and after the appearance of Christianity, women suffered severe
legal disabilities. The saga literature suggests, however, that the
situation of women may have been considerably less constrained than the
surviving law books imply.</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>Unn the Deep-Minded Takes Control of her Life</li>
</ol>
<p>The Saga of the People of Laxdale contains some of the most vivid
female characters in all of Icelandic literature. The saga begins with
the adventures of Unn the Deep-Minded, the daughter of Ketil Flatnose, a
nobleman who fled to Scotland rather than submit to Harald Finehair.
After the deaths of her male relatives in Scotland and Ireland, Unn
courageously gathers together her household and followers for a
migration to Iceland. Unn the Deep-Minded presents an alternative to the
largely masculine tales of Iceland’s foundation.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 6–15.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Ketil Flatnose sailed to Scotland where he was well received by men
of good family because he was famous and nobly born. They invited him to
stay there on whatever terms he pleased, so Ketil settled with the rest
of his family except for Thorstein the Red, the son of his daughter Unn,
who immediately went raiding. He made forays all over Scotland and was
always victorious. At length, he made a treaty with the Scots. By this
he gained half of Scotland and became king there. He married Thurid
Eyvindsdaughter, the sister of Helgi the Lean. The Scots did not keep
their agreement for long, but betrayed Thorstein during the truce [ca
880–890]. Ari Thorgilsson the Wise [author of The Book of the
Icelanders] records that he was killed in Caithness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unn the Deep-Minded was in Caithness when her son Thorstein was
killed. When she heard that he was dead, and since her father had also
died, she recognized that she wouldn’t have much of a future there. So,
she had a cargo ship built secretly in the forest and, when it was
ready, she loaded the ship with great riches and prepared it for
sailing. She took with her all the members of her family who were still
alive. Everyone agrees that it is hard to find another case of a woman
escaping with so much property and so many followers in the midst of
such hostilities. She was obviously an amazing woman. Unn was also
accompanied by many noteworthy and well-born men. A man named Koll was
one of the most outstanding in Unn’s band, mainly because of his birth;
he had the title of hersir [local chieftain, lord]. On the journey, too,
was a well-born and distinguished man by the name of Hord.</p>
<p>When her preparations were completed, Unn steered for the Orkneys
where she stayed for a short time and married off Gro, the daughter of
her son, Thorstein the Red…. The son of that marriage was Hlodver, the
father of Earl Sigurd whose son was Earl Thorfinn, and from this line
are descended all the earls of Orkney. Then Unn made for the Faeroes and
stayed there for a while. In the Faeroes, she arranged a marriage for
another of Thorstein’s daughters, Olof; from her marriage are descended
the Gotuskeggjar, the best known family in the Faeroes.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Unn prepared to leave the Faeroes and announced to her crew that she
intended to head for Iceland. Along with her went Olaf Feilan, the son
of Thorstein the Red, as well as Olaf’s unmarried sisters. She put to
sea and, after a good voyage, arrived at Vikrarskeid in the south of
Iceland, where they suffered shipwreck, but all hands survived and no
property was lost.</li>
</ol>
<p>With twenty of her men she went to visit her brother Helgi. When she
arrived, he came out to meet her and invited her to stay along with nine
of her men. Angrily, she answered that she hadn’t known he was so
mean-spirited. She left, intending to visit her brother Bjorn at his
home in Breidafjord. When Bjorn heard about her approach, he went to
greet her with a large band of men. He welcomed her warmly and invited
her to stay with him and to bring her entire company, for he understood
his sister’s expansive nature. This pleased her and she thanked him for
his generosity. She remained there all winter and was treated splendidly
as provisions were abundant and no expense was spared.</p>
<p>In spring, she crossed Breidafjord and arrived at a headland where
she and her companions had their morning meal, dogurthr. Thereafter, the
place was called Dogurness; it juts out from Medalfellsstrand. Then she
sailed in along Hvammsfjord and came to another headland where she
rested for a while and lost her comb. Since then the headland has been
called Kambsness. Next, she traveled all over the Breidafjord Valleys
and took as much land as she pleased. She sailed to the head of
Breidafjord. Her high-seat pillars had been washed ashore there, so she
thought this was clearly where she should make her home [high-seat
pillars were decorated pillars flanking the master of a household’s
seat; they had religious significance]. Then she built the farm that was
afterwards known as Hvamm and settled there. In the same spring as Unn
established herself at Hvamm, Koll married Thorgerd, the daughter of
Thorstein the Red. Unn met the costs of the wedding and gave Thorgerd
the whole of Laxdale for her dowry. Koll built a farm to the south of
the Lax River and was a very important man. Their son was Hoskuld.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Then Unn gave some of the land she had taken to other people. To
Hord she gave all of Hordadale as far as the Skramuhlaup River. He lived
at Hordabolstad and was a man of considerable note as well as being
fortunate in his offspring. His son was Asbjorn the Wealthy who settled
at Asbjornstad in Ornolfsdale. He married Thorbjorg, the daughter of
Skeggi from Midfjord. Their daughter was Ingibjorg who married Illugi
the Black and their sons were Hermund and Gunnlaug Serpent’s Tongue.
This family is known as the Gilsbekki clan.</li>
</ol>
<p>Unn addressed her men: “You must have a reward for your work now that
we have the means to repay your efforts and good will. You know that I
have given freedom to Erp, the son of Earl Meldun, for the last thing I
want is that a man of such a noble family should bear the name of
slave.”</p>
<p>Then Unn gave him land at Saudafell between the Tungu River and the
Mid River. His children were Orm and Asgeir, Gunnbjorn and Halldis whom
Alf of the Dales married. To Sokkolf she gave Sokkolfsdale, and he lived
there till old age. One of Unn’s freedmen was a Scot called Hundi. She
gave him Hundadale. Vifil was Unn’s fourth slave, and he received
Vifilsdale.</p>
<p>The fourth daughter of Thorstein the Red was Osk. She was the mother
of Thorstein the Black, known as the Wise. It was he who inserted an
extra week to correct the calendar [since the solar year and the
calendar had got out of step]. Thorstein the Red’s fifth daughter was
Thorhild. She was mother of Alf of the Dales from whom many men trace
their ancestry. His daughter was Thorgerd, the wife of Ari Masson, son
of Atli, son of Ulf the Squint and Bjorg Eyvindsdaughter, sister of
Helgi the Lean. From this line come the people of Reykjaness. The sixth
daughter of Thorstein the Red was Vigdis from whom are descended the
people of Hofdi in Eyjafjord.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Olaf Feilan was the youngest of Thorstein the Red’s children. He was
a big, strong man, good-looking, and very accomplished. Unn thought more
highly of him than of any other man and declared publicly that she
intended Olaf to inherit all her property at Hvamm after her death. When
Unn was becoming very weary with age, she called Olaf Feilan to her and
said to him, “It strikes me, kinsman, that you should settle down and
get married.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Olaf was amenable and said that he would trust her judgment in the
matter. Unn replied, “I really think that your wedding should take place
late this summer, because it’s easiest to get hold of all the necessary
provisions at that time of year and I’m sure that a great crowd of our
friends will be there as this is the last feast I intend to give.”</p>
<p>“That is generously said,” answered Olaf. “However, I won’t marry any
woman who will rob you of either your property or your authority.”</p>
<p>The same autumn, Olaf Feilan married Alfdis and their wedding took
place at Hvamm. Unn spent a great deal on the feast as she had sent
invitations to well-born men of other districts far and wide. She
invited her brothers Bjorn and Helgi and they came with many followers.
Her grandson-in-law, Koll of the Dales, came as did Hord of Hordadale
and many other prominent men. There were a great many wedding guests,
though nowhere near as many showed up as Unn had invited because it was
a long journey for the people of Eyjafjord.</p>
<p>Old age had taken its toll on Unn so that she didn’t get up before
the middle of the day and went to bed early. She allowed no one to
consult her from the time she went to bed till the time when she was up
and dressed and she answered irritably if anyone asked how she was. On
the day of the wedding, Unn slept longer than usual, but she was up and
about when the wedding guests arrived. She went out to meet them and
welcomed her relatives and friends honorably. She said that those who
had come a long way had shown her particular affection.</p>
<p>“I single out Bjorn and Helgi for this, but I thank all of you who
have come.”</p>
<p>Then Unn went into the hall with a large company. When the hall was
full, everyone was amazed at the splendor of the feast. Then Unn said,
“I call on you my brothers, Bjorn and Helgi, and my other relatives and
friends, to witness that I am handing over to my kinsman, Olaf, the
possession and management of this dwelling and of all the household
goods that you can see.”</p>
<p>After that, Unn stood up and said that she was going to her sleeping
chamber. She bade them enjoy themselves in whatever way they pleased,
and said that there should be enough ale to give everyone a good time.
People say that Unn was both tall and stout. She walked quickly along
the hall and people said that she was still a splendid woman.</p>
<p>They drank throughout the evening until they thought it was bedtime.
Next day, Olaf went to his grandmother Unn’s sleeping chamber. When he
entered the room, she was sitting upright against the pillows, and she
was dead. Olaf returned to the hall and announced what had happened.
Everyone thought it was wonderful how Unn had retained her dignity until
her dying day. Now they celebrated both the wedding of Olaf and the
funeral feast of Unn. On the last day of the feast, Unn was moved to the
burial mound that had been prepared for her. In the mound, she was
placed in a ship and much valuable property was laid beside her. Then
the burial mound was closed up.</p>
<p>Olaf Feilan took over the possession and management of Hvamm with the
consent of all the relatives who had come to visit. When the feast came
to an end, he presented expensive gifts to the most important guests
before they went away. Olaf became a great man and a powerful chieftain.
He lived at Hvamm till his old age.</p>

<li>Queen Gunnhild has her way with Hrut</li>
</ol>
<p>Njal’s Saga is marked by the presence of strong women such as Queen
Gunnhild, the widow of Eirik Bloodax, king of Norway. Her sons are
frequently referred to as the Gunnhildarsons rather than as the
Eirikssons. In this selection, she dominates her son, King Harald
Greycloak, and uses her power to the advantage of Hrut, an Icelander
with whom she has an affair.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 11–21.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Harald Greycloak [Harald II, d. 976] was king of Norway. He was the
son of Eirik Bloodax [r. 930–934, d. 954], the son of Harald Finehair.
His mother was Gunnhild, the daughter of Ozur Toti. Harald and Gunnhild
had their residence at Konungahella [King’s Rock, near Viken] in the
east of the country.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now word spread that a ship from the west had arrived in Vik. As soon
as Gunnhild heard the report, she asked what Icelanders were aboard. She
was told that one of the Icelanders was a man called Hrut, the nephew of
Ozur.</p>
<p>“I know what he’s here for,” Gunnhild said. “He wants to claim his
inheritance, which has been seized by a man called Soti.”</p>
<p>She called for her servant, Ogmund: “I’m sending you to Vik to meet
Ozur and Hrut,” she said. “Tell them that I’m inviting both of them to
spend the winter with me and that I wish to be their friend. If Hrut
follows my advice, I’ll take care of his financial business and anything
else he undertakes. I shall also bring him to the notice of the
king.”</p>
<p>Ogmund left and went to meet Ozur and Hrut who received him warmly
when they learned that he was one of Gunnhild’s servants. Ogmund gave
them Gunnhild’s message in secret and, afterwards, Ozur and Hrut
discussed their options in private. Ozur remarked to Hrut, “I think,
kinsman, that our minds have been made up for us because I know what
Gunnhild is like. If we don’t go to her, she will quickly drive us out
of the country and seize all our property, but if we do go to her, she
will treat us honorably just as she has promised.”</p>
<p>Ogmund returned home and when he met Gunnhild, he told her that his
errand had been successful; Hrut and Ozur would come. “That is just what
I expected,” said Gunnhild, “for Hrut is said to be a clever and
sensible man. Now keep a lookout and tell me when they reach town.”</p>
<p>Hrut and his men traveled east to Konungahella. When they arrived,
their kinsfolk and friends came to meet them and gave them a friendly
welcome. They asked if the king was in residence and were told that he
was. A little later, they met Ogmund, who passed on Gunnhild’s
greetings, adding that she would not invite them to her house until they
had met the king, for fear that people would gossip and say that she was
making too much of them. She would, however, do whatever she thought fit
on their behalf and Hrut, for his part, should speak boldly to the king
and ask to be one of his retainers.</p>
<p>“Here are some splendid robes that she has sent you, Hrut,” said
Ogmund. “You must wear them when you go before the king.” Then he went
away.</p>
<p>Next day, Hrut said, “Let’s go before the king.” “Right,” replied
Ozur.</p>
<p>Twelve men, all kinsmen and friends, went together in a group. When
they reached the hall where the king sat drinking, Hrut led the way and
greeted him. The king looked carefully at this well-dressed man and
asked him his name. Hrut told him.</p>
<p>“Are you an Icelander?” asked the king. Hrut answered that he
was.</p>
<p>“What brought you here to visit us?” the king asked.</p>
<p>“I was anxious to see your magnificence, my lord,” said Hrut. “Also,
I am laying claim to a large inheritance in this country and I will need
your support if I am to have justice.”</p>
<p>“I have promised justice to everyone in this land,” said the king.
“Have you any other reason for coming to see us?” “My lord,” said Hrut,
“I ask your permission to join your retinue and become one of your
followers.” The king was silent. Then Gunnhild spoke.</p>
<p>“I think that this man is offering you a great honor,” she said. “In
my opinion, if there were many men like him in your retinue, it would be
well manned.”</p>
<p>“Is he an intelligent man?” asked the king. “He is both intelligent
and energetic,” said Gunnhild.</p>
<p>“I gather that my mother wants you to have the position you asked
for. Out of respect for our dignity and the customs of the land,
however, you must come back again in two weeks time, and then you will
become a member of my retinue—until then, my mother will look after
you.”</p>
<p>“Go with them to my house,” said Gunnhild to Ogmund, “and prepare a
splendid feast for them.” They went out with Ogmund, who led them to a
stone-built hall, decorated with the finest tapestries. Gunnhild had her
high seat there.</p>
<p>“Now you will see that I told you the truth about Gunnhild,” said
Ogmund. “Here is her high seat. You may sit on it, and you may stay
sitting on it even when she herself comes in.” Then Ogmund provided a
feast for them. They had barely sat down when Gunnhild came in. Hrut was
about to leap up and greet her.</p>
<p>“Sit down,” she said. “As long as you are my guest you must always
sit on this seat.” Then she sat down beside Hrut and they drank
together. In the course of the evening, Gunnhild said, “Tonight you
shall lie with me in the upper chamber—there will be just the two of
us.”</p>
<p>“You are the one who must make that decision,” he said. Then they
went to bed and she locked the room from the inside. They slept there
that night and in the morning they drank together. For the whole two
weeks, the two of them lay on their own in the upper room. Then Gunnhild
said to the people in her household, “Your days will be numbered if you
say a word about Hrut and me.”</p>
<p>Hrut gave Gunnhild a hundred ells of cloth [a Norwegian ell is 62.8
centimeters] and twelve fur cloaks. She thanked him for the gift. Hrut
kissed her and thanked her. Then she wished him farewell and off he
went. Next day, Hrut came before the king with thirty men and greeted
him.</p>
<p>“Now, Hrut,” said the king, “you must want me to make good on my
promise.”</p>
<p>Then Hrut became a member of the retinue.</p>
<p>“Where shall I sit?” asked Hrut.</p>
<p>“My mother will decide that,” replied the king.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>In the spring, Hrut heard that Soti had traveled south to Denmark,
taking the inheritance with him. So he went to Gunnhild and told her
about Soti’s journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>“I will give you two fully manned longships,” said Gunnhild, “and, in
addition, I’ll give you Ulf the Unwashed, who is a very brave man and
the head of our spies. But go and see the king before you leave.”</p>
<p>Hrut did so, and when he came before the king, he told him about
Soti’s movements, and told him too that he intended to go in pursuit of
him. “What assistance has my mother given you?” asked the king.</p>
<p>“Two longships and Ulf the Unwashed to command the force,” replied
Hrut.</p>
<p>“That is a splendid gift,” said the king. “Now I will give you two
more ships. You will need this large a force.” Later, the king
accompanied Hrut to his ship and wished him farewell. Then Hrut sailed
south with his forces.</p>
<p>[In chapter 5, Hrut defeats some pirates on his way to Denmark. Soti
evades Hrut and appears in Norway, where he is captured and killed by
Gunnhild’s son, Gudrod. Hrut receives his inheritance from Gunnhild and
gives her half of it.]</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Hrut spent the winter with the king and enjoyed great favor. But
when the spring arrived, he became very quiet. Gunnhild noticed this
and, when they were alone she asked: “Are you depressed, Hrut?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“As the saying goes,” said Hrut, “things are always better at home
than abroad.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to go back to Iceland?” she asked. “I do,” he replied.
“Have you got a woman out there?” she asked. “No,” replied Hrut. “I’m
sure you do,” she said and, at that, they broke off the
conversation.</p>
<p>Hrut presented himself to the king and greeted him. The king asked:
“What do you want, Hrut?” “My lord, I wish to ask you for leave to
return to Iceland,” said Hrut. “Will you be more honored there than
here?” asked the king.</p>
<p>“No,” replied Hrut, “but everyone must do what he is destined to
do.”</p>
<p>“You’re in a tug-of-war with a strong man,” said Gunnhild. “Give him
permission to travel wherever he wants.” It had been a bad year in
Norway, but even so the king gave Hrut as much flour as he wanted.</p>
<p>Then he and Ozur prepared for the journey to Iceland and, when they
were quite ready, Hrut went to see the king and Gunnhild. She led him
aside for some words in private: “Here is a gold ring I want to give
you,” she said, and slipped it onto his arm.</p>
<p>“I have received many fine gifts from you,” replied Hrut.</p>
<p>She put her arms around his neck, kissed him, and said, “If I have as
much power over you as I think I do, then I cast this spell on you: you
will be unable to achieve sexual satisfaction with the woman you have
chosen in Iceland, though you will be able to perform with other women.
Now we’re both going to be miserable because you weren’t open and honest
with me.” Hrut laughed and went away….</p>
<p>[Gunnhild’s spell works: Hrut’s first marriage is a disaster and ends
in divorce.]</p>
