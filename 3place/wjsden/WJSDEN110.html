<h4 id="svein-asleifarsons-viking-life">80. Svein Asleifarson’s Viking
Life</h4>
<p>One of the most colorful characters in the pages of Orkneyinga saga
is Svein Asleifarson. Svein’s historicity is not in doubt, though
Orkneyinga saga is virtually the only source for his life and exploits.
Svein was by turns confidant, advisor, and rival to several earls of
Orkney. He was a farmer, fisherman, and landlord; a warrior, pirate, and
mercenary. His exploits extended to Scotland, the Hebrides, the Isle of
Man, England, Wales, and Ireland, and his reputation was such that he
was celebrated by the author of the saga as “the most outstanding of all
the men in the Westlands, either past or present” of similar rank. He
died, according to the saga, on a raid to Dublin.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Orkneyinga saga, ed. Finnbogi
Guðmundsson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXIV (Reykjavík, 1965), pp. 283–88.</p>
<ol start="105" type="1">
<li>After the death of Earl Rognvald [in 1158], Earl Harald [Harald
Maddadarson, ca 1134–1206] subjugated the islands and made himself sole
ruler over all of them. Earl Harald was a great chieftain and a very
big, strong man. He married a woman named Afreka, and their children
were called Heinrek, Hakon, Helena, and Margret. When Hakon was only a
few years old, Svein Asleifarson offered to take him as his foster-son,
and he was brought up by Svein on Gareksey [Gairsay]. As soon as Hakon
was old enough to travel with the other men, Svein took him raiding
every summer and sought to advance his reputation in whatever way he
could.</li>
</ol>
<p>At that time, it was Svein’s custom to spend his winters at home in
Gareksey [Gairsay], where he always kept eighty men around him at his
own expense. His drinking hall was so large that there was nothing to
equal it in the Orkneys. Svein was always very busy in the spring; he
had a great quantity of seed planted, attending to much of the work
himself. Every spring, when the planting was over, he went on a Viking
expedition, raiding in the Hebrides and Ireland. He called this his
spring-raid. He returned home after midsummer and stayed at home until
the fields were harvested and the grain was stored. Then he went on
another Viking trip and did not return until the first month of winter
was over. He called this his autumn-raid.</p>
<ol start="106" type="1">
<li>Once, Svein Asleifarson was away on his spring-raid, accompanied by
Hakon, the son of Earl Harald. They had five large galleys with which
they raided in the Hebrides.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Hebrideans were so afraid of Svein that they buried their
property or hid it under rocks. Then Svein sailed as far south as the
Isle of Man, but he found little in the way of plunder, so he sailed out
to Ireland and began raiding there. As they were heading south to
Dublin, they saw two English merchant ships also making for Dublin. They
were laden with English cloth and many other valuable goods. Svein
accosted the ships and challenged the Englishmen to battle, but they
didn’t put up much of a fight, so Svein and his men robbed them of every
last penny. The Englishmen kept only the clothes they stood up in and
some provisions, and afterwards they were allowed to sail away in their
own ships.</p>
<p>Then Svein and his fellow-raiders made for the Hebrides where they
divided up their plunder. Afterwards, they traveled east in great
splendor. Whenever they lay in harbor, they drew attention to themselves
by using English cloth as awnings, and when they sailed to the Orkneys,
they stitched English cloth to the front of their sails to give the
impression that the sails were made from rich material. They called this
trip their “cloth-raiding” trip, but Svein had also robbed the English
ships of a large quantity of wine and English mead, and he took this
home with him to Gareksey.</p>
<p>After Svein had been at home for a little while, he invited Earl
Harald to visit and prepared a splendid banquet in his honor. At the
banquet, there was much talk about Svein’s lavish hospitality. Then the
earl spoke.</p>
<p>“I want you to give up raiding now, Svein,” he said. “It’s good to
drive home with a full wagon, and you’ve certainly supported yourself
and your men for a long time by raiding, but most men who live by
looting and pillaging die on raids if they don’t get out in time.”</p>
<p>Svein looked at the earl and answered with a smile, “Friendly words
indeed, my lord, and I’m grateful for your advice, though some might
argue that you yourself are not the most peaceful of men.”</p>
<p>“I shall have to answer for my own deeds,” answered the earl. “But
that doesn’t stop me from speaking my mind.”</p>
<p>“You mean well, my lord,” said Svein. “So, I’ll give up raiding
because I find that with age my strength is being drained away by the
exertions of war. I’ll go on my autumn-raid now, and I hope it will be
as glorious as my spring-raid. After that I’ll give up raiding.”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to predict, old friend, whether death or glory will come
first,” said the earl. After that, the conversation came to an end. Earl
Harald left the banquet and was sent on his way with appropriate gifts.
He and Svein parted on very friendly terms.</p>
<ol start="107" type="1">
<li>Soon after this, Svein got ready for his raiding trip. He had seven
longships, all of them large. Again, Hakon, Earl Harald’s son, joined
him on the journey. First, they steered for the Hebrides but, finding
little plunder there, they crossed over to Ireland where they raided
extensively.</li>
</ol>
<p>They traveled as far south as Dublin where they took the townspeople
completely by surprise. No one was aware of their presence until they
were actually inside the town, seizing a great deal of plunder. The
leading townsmen were captured and surrendered the town to Svein,
promising to pay whatever ransom he demanded. They also agreed that
Svein and his men should occupy the town and rule it, and the people of
Dublin swore an oath confirming this. In the evening, the Orkneymen went
back to their ships, but next morning, Svein was to occupy the town,
receive the ransom, and take hostages from the townsfolk.</p>
<p>Now the story turns to what happened in the town during the night.
The leaders in the town held a meeting to discuss the troubles which had
befallen them. They had no desire to turn their town over to the
Orkneymen, and, worst of all, to the man whom they knew to be the most
tyrannical in the Westlands, so they made up their minds to deceive
Svein if at all possible. This is the plan they came up with: they dug
deep pits just inside the town gates and also in several other places
between the houses on the route that Svein and his men were expected to
take. They concealed armed men in the nearby houses. Then they covered
the pits with wood which would collapse under a man’s weight. After
that, they spread straw over the wood so that no trace of the pits could
be seen. Then they waited for morning.</p>
<ol start="108" type="1">
<li>Next morning, Svein and his men got up, armed themselves, and set
off for Dublin. When the Orkneymen entered the town, the Dubliners
formed a lane of men from the gate to the pits. Svein and his men didn’t
notice anything amiss and ran straight into the pits. Some of the
townsmen immediately stationed themselves in front of the gate while
others ran up to the pits, turning their weapons on Svein and his men,
who had a hard time defending themselves. And so Svein Asleifarson died
there in the pits along with all the other Orkneymen who had entered the
town.</li>
</ol>
<p>The story goes that Svein was last to die and that he spoke these
words before his death. “Whether I die today or not, let all men know
that I am a retainer of the holy Earl Rognvald and I intend to place my
trust in him now that he is with God.”</p>
<p>The rest of Svein’s men returned to their ships and sailed away.
There is nothing more to say about their journey except that they
reached Orkney. Now Svein’s story is ended. It is the general view that,
except for men of higher rank than himself, he was the most outstanding
of all the men in the Westlands, either past or present.</p>
