<h4 id="c-how-aud-dealt-with-her-humiliating-divorce-aaaaaaaa">(c) How
Aud Dealt with Her Humiliating Divorce AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Gudrun Osvifrsdaughter becomes involved with Thord Ingunnarson, who,
unfortunately, is already married to Aud. The resourceful Gudrun
suggests a pretext by which Thord can get a divorce from her. Aud does
not simply fade away but exacts an ironic revenge on Thord for her
humiliation. From The Saga of the People of Laxdale.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 95–98.</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>…Gudrun Osvifrsdaughter rode to the Althing and Thord Ingunnarson
went with her. One day, as they were riding across Blaskogarheath in
fine weather, Gudrun asked,</li>
</ol>
<p>“Is it true, Thord, that your wife, Aud, always wears men’s breeches
and leg-bands that reach almost to her shoes?” He replied that he hadn’t
noticed.</p>
<p>“There can’t be much truth to the rumor if you haven’t noticed it,”
said Gudrun. “But why else is she called Aud-in-Breeches?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think she can have been called that for long,” said
Thord.</p>
<p>“What’s really important is how long the name sticks,” replied
Gudrun.</p>
<p>After that, people arrived at the Althing: nothing of much importance
happened there. Thord spent a lot of time in Gest’s booth and was
forever talking with Gudrun. One day, he asked her what would be the
consequences for a woman who always wore trousers like a man. Gudrun
answered, “A woman who does this should face the same penalty as a man
who has so large an opening in his shirt that his nipples are exposed.
Both are grounds for divorce.”</p>
<p>Thord said, “Do you think I should announce my divorce from Aud here
at the Althing, or at home in my own district where I’ll have the
backing of more supporters? For the men who are likely to take offence
at this are proud and touchy.”</p>
<p>After a moment, Gudrun answered, “The timid postpone their lawsuits
till evening.” Then Thord sprang up and went to the Law Rock. He named
witnesses and declared that he was divorcing Aud, on the grounds that
she wore gored breeches as though she were a man.</p>
<p>Aud’s brothers were not at all happy about this, but they took no
action. Thord rode from the Thing with the Osvifrssons. When Aud heard
the news, she said:</p>
<p>It’s as well to know</p>
<p>I’m deserted so.</p>
<p>Later, Thord and eleven others rode west to Saurby for the division
of the estate. This went without a hitch as Thord made no difficulties
about how the property was split up. Then he went back to Laugar with a
great number of livestock and asked for Gudrun’s hand in marriage. His
request was granted willingly by Osvifr, and Gudrun didn’t object. The
wedding was to take place at Laugar ten weeks before the end of summer.
The feast was splendid and Thord and Gudrun were happy in their
marriage. The only reason that Thorkel Whelp and Knut [Aud’s brothers]
did not bring a lawsuit against Thord Ingunnarson was that they had no
support for it.</p>
<p>The following summer Aud and the men of Hol were at their shieling [a
summer pasture, usually with a cottage] in Hvammsdal. The men of Laugar
had their shieling in Lambadal, which runs west into the mountains from
Saelingsdal. Aud asked the fellow who looked after their sheep how often
he ran into the shepherd from Laugar. He said that was always happening,
not surprisingly, as only a single ridge separated the shielings. Aud
said,</p>
<p>“Go and meet the shepherd from Laugar today and find out for me who
is at the shieling and who has stayed behind at the main farm. Talk
about Thord in a very friendly fashion, just as you ought to.”</p>
<p>The boy promised to do as she asked and when he came home in the
evening, Aud asked for his news. The shepherd replied, “I’ve heard news
you’re going to like. There’s quite a distance just now between the beds
of Thord and Gudrun, for she’s at the shieling and he’s working himself
to death building a house. He and Osvifr are the only two at the home
farm.”</p>
<p>“What a great job of spying you’ve done!” said Aud. “When everyone
goes to bed, have two horses saddled.”</p>
<p>The shepherd did as she asked and shortly before sunset Aud mounted
her horse. On this occasion she was definitely wearing breeches. She
pressed on so hard that the shepherd on the other horse could barely
keep up with her. She rode south across Saelingsdal Heath and didn’t
come to a halt until she got to the fence around Laugar farm. There she
dismounted and told the shepherd to watch the horses while she made her
way to the house. Aud went up to the entry and found the door open. She
entered the main room and walked toward the bed closet where Thord lay
asleep. The door was shut but not bolted. She entered the bed-closet and
found Thord sleeping on his back. Then Aud woke Thord and he turned
toward the door when he realized that a man had come in. She drew a
short sword and thrust at Thord, wounding him seriously in the right arm
and cutting across both nipples. She thrust so hard that the sword
lodged itself in the wooden bed. After that, Aud went back to her horse,
leapt into the saddle, and rode home.</p>
<p>Thord tried to spring to his feet when he was wounded, but he
couldn’t as the loss of blood had weakened him. Awakened by the noise,
Osvifr asked what had happened and Thord told him that he had been
wounded. Osvifr got up and saw to Thord’s wounds. He asked him if he
knew who had done this to him. Thord said he thought that Aud had done
it. Osvifr offered to ride in pursuit of her. He said she was likely to
have come without many companions and so her punishment would be
assured. Thord declared he was far from wishing any such thing and that
Aud had just done what she had to do.</p>
<p>When Aud arrived home at dawn, her brothers asked where she had been.
She answered that she had been to Laugar and told them what she had done
there. They were delighted but said that she had not gone far enough.
Thord’s wounds kept him in bed for a long time. Though the injuries on
his chest healed well, his arm was never the same again….</p>
