<h4 id="franks-and-vikings-800829-aaaaaaaa">46. Franks and Vikings,
800–829 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Royal Frankish Annals covers the period 741 to 829. Written at
the royal Frankish court, it has been described as the single most
important source for the reign of Charlemagne (768–814). It is regarded
as an official court source and demonstrates detailed knowledge of
contemporary events. Military activities are to the forefront, and the
annals provide contemporary evidence of relations between the
Carolingians and the Northmen; later entries are very well informed on
Scandinavian affairs.</p>
<p>Source: trans. B.W. Scholz and B. Rogers, Carolingian Chronicles:
Royal Frankish Annals and Nithard’s Histories (Ann Arbor: University of
Michigan Press, 1970), pp. 78–125, excerpts.</p>
<ol start="800" type="1">
<li><p>[Charlemagne] left the palace of Aachen in the middle of March
and traversed the shore of the Gallic sea. He built a fleet on this sea,
which was then infested with pirates, set guards in different places,
and celebrated Easter at St. Riquier in Centulum….</p></li>
<li><p>The emperor spent the winter at Aachen. But in the summer he led
an army into Saxony and deported all Saxons living beyond the Elbe and
in Wihmuodi [east of the Weser, near Verden] with wives and children
into Francia and gave the districts beyond the Elbe to the Obodrites [a
Slavic people who controlled Holstein and
Mecklenburg-Schwerin].</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At the same time Godofrid, king of the Danes, came with his fleet and
the entire cavalry of his kingdom to Schleswig on the border of his
kingdom and Saxony. He promised to show up for a conference with the
emperor, but was made wary by the counsel of his men and did not venture
any closer. Instead he communicated through envoys whatever he wanted to
say. The emperor stayed at Hollenstedt on the River Elbe and sent an
embassy to Godofrid to discuss the return of fugitives. About the middle
of September he returned to Cologne. After dismissing the army he went
first to Aachen and then into the Ardennes. He devoted himself to the
chase and then returned to Aachen.</p>
<ol start="808" type="1">
<li>The winter was extremely mild and unhealthy at that time. When
spring came, the emperor went to Nijmegen. After spending Lent and
celebrating Holy Easter there, he returned again to Aachen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since he was informed that Godofrid, the king of the Danes, with his
army had crossed over into the land of the Obodrites, he sent his son
Charles with a strong host of Franks and Saxons to the Elbe, with orders
to resist the mad king if he should attempt to attack the borders of
Saxony. Godofrid set up quarters on the shore for some days and attacked
and took a number of Slavic castles in hand-to-hand combat. Then he
withdrew, suffering severe casualties. He expelled Thrasco, duke of the
Obodrites, who did not trust the loyalty of his countrymen, hanged on
the gallows Godelaib, another duke, whom he had caught by treachery, and
made two-thirds of the Obodrites tributary. But he lost the best and
battle-tested of his soldiers. With them he lost Reginold, his brother’s
son, who was killed at the siege of a town along with a great number of
Danish nobles. But Charles, the son of the emperor, built a bridge
across the Elbe, and moved the army under his command as fast as he
could across the river against the Linones and Smeldingi. These tribes
had also defected to Godofrid. Charles laid waste their fields far and
wide and after crossing the river again returned to Saxony with his army
unimpaired.</p>
<p>On this expedition Godofrid had as his allies the Slavs called Wilzi,
who joined his forces voluntarily because of their ancient conflicts
with the Obodrites. When Godofrid returned home, they also went home
with the booty which they had been able to capture from the Obodrites.
But Godofrid before his return destroyed a trading place on the
seashore, in Danish called Reric, which, because of the taxes it paid,
was of great advantage to his kingdom. Transferring the merchants from
Reric he weighed anchor and came with his whole army to the harbor of
Schleswig. There he remained for a few days and decided to fortify the
border of his kingdom against Saxony with a rampart, so that a
protective bulwark would stretch from the eastern bay, called Ostarsalt,
as far as the western sea, along the entire north bank of the river
Eider and broken by a single gate through which wagons and horsemen
would be able to leave and enter. After dividing the work among the
leaders of his troops he returned home.</p>
<ol start="809" type="1">
<li>…When Eardwulf, king of the Northumbrians, had been taken back to
his kingdom and the envoys of emperor and pontiff were returning, all
crossed without mishap except one of them, the deacon Aldulf, who was
captured by pirates and taken to Britain. But he was ransomed by one of
King Cenwulf’s men and returned to Rome….</li>
</ol>
<p>In the meantime Godofrid, king of the Danes, sent word by some
merchants that he had heard of the emperor’s wrath against him because
he had led an army against the Obodrites the year before and revenged
himself for injuries done to him. Godofrid added that he would like to
purge himself of the charges made against him and that the Obodrites had
broken the peace first. He also requested that a meeting between his
counts and the emperor’s should take place beyond the Elbe near the
borders of his kingdom. There they would establish what both parties had
done and determine what redresses were to be made. This the emperor did
not refuse. A conference was held with Danish nobles beyond the Elbe at
Badenfliot. Both sides brought up and elaborated on a number of matters
and then departed, leaving the entire question unsettled. But Thrasco,
duke of the Obodrites, first surrendered his son as a hostage to
Godofrid as Godofrid demanded, and then gathered an army of his people.
Supported by the Saxons, he attacked the neighboring Wilzi and laid
waste their fields with fire and sword. Returning home with immense
booty and with even more help from the Saxons, he conquered the largest
city of the Smeldingi. By these successes he forced all who had defected
from him to join him again….</p>
<p>Since he had heard much of the arrogance and pride of the Danish
king, the emperor decided to build a castle on the other side of the
Elbe and to garrison it with a Frankish force. For this purpose he
gathered men in Gaul and Germany equipped with arms and all other
necessities, and ordered them to be taken by way of Frisia to their
destination. In the meantime Thrasco, duke of the Obodrites, was
treacherously killed by Godofrid’s men at the trading place of Reric.
When the location for the founding of a castle had been explored, the
emperor appointed Count Egbert to be responsible for this matter,
ordering him to cross the Elbe and to occupy the site. This place is
located on the River Stör and is called Esesfelth. Egbert and the Saxon
counts occupied it and began to fortify it about March 15.</p>
<ol start="810" type="1">
<li>…While the emperor was still at Aachen, considering an expedition
against King Godofrid, he received the news that a fleet of two hundred
ships from Denmark had landed in Frisia, that all the islands off the
coast of Frisia had been ravaged, that the army had already landed and
fought three battles against the Frisians, that the victorious Danes had
imposed a tribute on the vanquished, that already one hundred pounds of
silver had been paid as tribute by the Frisians, and that King Godofrid
was at home. That, in fact, is how things stood. This information
aroused the emperor so much that he sent out messengers everywhere to
gather an army. Leaving the palace without delay, he decided first to go
and meet the fleet, then to cross the Rhine at Lippeham and wait for the
troops which had not yet arrived…. When the troops had finally
assembled, the emperor hastened to the Aller at the greatest possible
speed, set up camp where it flows into the Weser, and then waited for
what would come of King Godofrid’s threats. Inflated by the vain hope of
victory, this king boasted that he wished to fight the emperor in open
battle.</li>
</ol>
<p>But while the emperor had his quarters in the place mentioned, news
of various matters was brought to him. It was reported that the fleet
which ravaged Frisia had returned home and King Godofrid had been
murdered by one of his retainers; that the castle of Hohbuoki on the
Elbe, with Odo, the emperor’s envoy, and a garrison of east Saxons had
been captured by the Wilzi; that his son Pepin, the king of Italy, had
died on July 8, and that two embassies to make peace had arrived from
different countries, one from Constantinople, the other from Cordova.
When the emperor had received all these reports, he settled the affairs
of Saxony as far as circumstances at that time permitted and returned
home….</p>
<p>After the death of Godofrid, king of the Danes, Hemming, the son of
his brother, succeeded to his throne and made peace with the
emperor.</p>
<ol start="811" type="1">
<li>…The peace announced between the emperor and Hemming, the king of
the Danes, was only sworn on arms because of the severity of the winter,
which closed the road for traveling between the parties. Only with the
return of spring and the opening of the roads, which had been closed
because of harsh frost, did twelve magnates of each party and people,
that is, of Franks and Danes, meet on the River Eider at Heiligen and
confirm the peace by an exchange of oaths according to their
customs….</li>
</ol>
<p>[Following a general assembly at Aachen and campaigns beyond the
Elbe, in Pannonia, and Brittany] the emperor himself went to the port
city of Boulogne in order to inspect the fleet whose construction he had
ordered the year before. There the ships in question had assembled. At
Boulogne he restored the lighthouse constructed a long time ago to guide
the course of sailors and had a fire lit on its top at night. From
Boulogne he came to the River Scheldt at Ghent and inspected the ships
built for the same fleet. About the middle of November he came to
Aachen. The envoys of King Hemming, Aowin and Hebbi, came to meet him
and brought presents and assurances of peace….</p>
<ol start="812" type="1">
<li>Not much later the news arrived that Hemming, king of the Danes, had
died. Sigifrid, the nephew of King Godofrid, and Anulo, the nephew of
Heriold and of the former king, both wished to succeed him. Being unable
to agree on who should be king, they raised troops, fought a battle, and
were both killed. The party of Anulo won, however, and made his brothers
Heriold and Reginfrid their kings. The defeated party of necessity had
to go along with Anulo’s party and did not reject the brothers as their
kings. They say that ten thousand nine hundred and forty men died in
that battle….</li>
</ol>
<p>Also a fleet of the Norsemen landed in Ireland, the island of the
Scots, and in a battle with the Scots many of the Norsemen were killed,
and the fleet returned home after shameful flight….</p>
<p>Heriold and Reginfrid, kings of the Danes, sent an embassy to the
emperor, asking for peace and requesting that their brother Hemming be
released.</p>
<ol start="813" type="1">
<li><p>[A general assembly at Aachen.] From this assembly several
Frankish and Saxon nobles were sent beyond the Elbe to the borders of
the Norsemen. They came to make peace, at the request of the Danish
kings, whose brother they intended to return. When an equal number—they
were sixteen—of Danish magnates met them at the stipulated place, peace
was sworn by mutual oaths and the brother of the kings was returned. The
kings themselves at this time were not at home but had marched with an
army toward Westarfolda [in southern Norway], an area in the extreme
northwest of their kingdom across from the northern tip of Britain,
whose princes and people refused to submit to them. When they returned
after conquering the Britons and received their brother, who had been
sent from the emperor, the sons of King Godofrid gathered troops from
everywhere and made war upon the kings. The sons of King Godofrid were
assisted by not a few of the Danish nobles who for some time after
leaving their homeland had been in exile with the Swedes. Since hosts of
their countrymen joined the sons of Godofrid from all over the land of
the Danes, they easily drove the kings from the kingdom after a
battle.</p></li>
<li><p>[The annals record the death of Charlemagne, the succession of
Louis, and summarize diplomatic affairs.] Heriold and Reginfrid, kings
of the Danes, had been defeated and expelled from their kingdom the year
before by the sons of Godofrid, against whom they regrouped their forces
and again made war. In this conflict Reginfrid and the oldest son of
Godofrid were killed. When this had come to pass, Heriold despaired of
his cause, came to the emperor, and put himself under his protection.
The emperor [Louis] received him and told him to go to Saxony and wait
for the proper time when he would be able to give him the help which
Heriold had requested.</p></li>
<li><p>The emperor commanded that Saxons and Obodrites should prepare
for this campaign, and twice in that winter the attempt was made to
cross the Elbe. But since the weather suddenly turned warm and made the
ice on the river melt, the campaign was held up. Finally, when the
winter was over, about the middle of May, the proper time for the march
arrived. Then all Saxon counts and all troops of the Obodrites, under
orders to bring help to Heriold, marched with the imperial emissary
Baldrich across the River Eider into the land of the Norsemen called
Silendi [in eastern Schleswig]. From Silendi they went on and, finally,
on the seventh day, pitched camp on the coast at…. There they halted for
three days. But the sons of Godofrid, who had raised against them a
large army and a fleet of two hundred ships, remained on an island three
miles off the shore and did not dare engage them. Therefore, after
everywhere laying waste the neighboring districts and receiving hostages
from the people, they returned to the emperor in Saxony, who at that
time was holding the general assembly of his people at
Paderborn….</p></li>
<li><p>…Because of Heriold’s persistent aggression, the sons of
Godofrid, king of the Danes, also sent an embassy to the emperor, asked
for peace, and promised to preserve it. This sounded more like hypocrisy
than truth, so it was dismissed as empty talk and aid was given to
Heriold against them….</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When the news of the revolt of the Obodrites and of Sclaomir arrived,
he ordered through his envoys that counts be stationed for the defense
on the River Elbe to protect the borders assigned to them. The cause of
the revolt was that Sclaomir was to share with Ceadrag, son of Thrasco,
the royal power over the Obodrites which Sclaomir had held alone after
the death of Thrasco. This matter exasperated Sclaomir so much that he
solemnly declared he would never again cross the Elbe and come to the
palace. He at once sent an embassy across the sea, made friends with the
sons of Godofrid, and coaxed them to send an army into Saxony beyond the
Elbe. Their fleet came up the Elbe as far as the castle of Esesfeld and
ravaged the entire bank of the River Stör. Gluomi, commander of the
Norse border, led his foot soldiers overland with the Obodrites to the
same castle. But since our people offered them violent resistance, they
gave up the siege of the castle and departed.</p>
<ol start="819" type="1">
<li><p>…On the emperor’s order Heriold was taken to his ships by the
Obodrites and sailed back to his homeland to take over the kingdom. Two
of the sons of Godofrid are said to have made an alliance with him to
share the throne; two others were driven out of the country. But this is
believed to have been done by trickery.</p></li>
<li><p>…From the land of the Norsemen…thirteen pirate vessels set out
and tried to plunder on the shores of Flanders, but were repelled by
guards. But because of the carelessness of the defenders, some wretched
huts were burned down and a small number of cattle taken away. When the
Norsemen made similar attempts on the mouth of the River Seine, the
coast guards fought back, and the pirates retreated empty-handed after
losing five men. Finally, on the coast of Aquitaine they met with
success, thoroughly plundered a village by the name of Bouin, and then
returned home with immense booty.</p></li>
<li><p>Everything was quiet on the Danish front in this year, and
Heriold was received as partner in the rule by the sons of Godofrid.
This is believed to have caused peaceful relations among them at this
time….</p></li>
<li><p>…Also Heriold came from Nordmannia, asking for help against the
sons of Godofrid, who threatened to drive him out of his country. To
explore this matter more thoroughly Counts Theothari and Hruodmund were
sent to the sons of Godofrid. Traveling ahead of Heriold they carefully
studied the dispute with the sons of Godofrid as well as the condition
of the whole kingdom of the Norsemen and informed the emperor of all
that they could find out in those lands. They returned with Archbishop
Ebbo of Reims, who had gone to preach in the land of the Danes on the
counsel of the emperor and with the approval of the Roman pontiff and
had baptized many converts to the faith during the previous
summer.</p></li>
<li><p>…the emperor left Aachen in the middle of May and arrived at
Ingelheim about June 1. He held an assembly there that was heavily
attended, receiving and dismissing many embassies from various
countries…. The envoys of the sons of Godofrid, king of the Danes, had
also been sent there to make peace and clinch an alliance….</p></li>
</ol>
<p>At the same time Heriold came with his wife and a great number of
Danes and was baptized with his companions at St. Alban’s in Mainz. The
emperor presented him with many gifts before he returned home through
Frisia, the route by which he had come. In this province, one county was
given to him, the county of Rüstringen, so that he would be able to find
refuge there with his possessions if he were ever in danger….</p>
<ol start="827" type="1">
<li><p>…In the meantime the kings of the Danes, that is, the sons of
Godofrid, deprived Heriold of his share in the kingship and forced him
to leave Nordmannia….</p></li>
<li><p>…Near the border of Nordmannia in the meantime negotiations were
planned to ratify the peace between Norsemen and Franks and to discuss
the affair of Heriold. For this business counts and margraves came from
almost all of Saxony. But Heriold was too thirsty for action. He broke
the peace that had been agreed upon and confirmed by hostages, and
burned and pillaged some small villages of the Norsemen. Upon hearing
this the sons of Godofrid immediately gathered troops. Our people were
stationed on the bank of the River Eider, not expecting any trouble. The
sons of Godofrid advanced toward the march, crossed the river, and
attacked the Franks, driving them out of their castle and putting them
to flight. They took everything from them and retreated with all their
forces to their camp. Then they deliberated how to ward off revenge for
this action. They dispatched an embassy to the emperor and explained
that need had compelled them against their will to do this, that they
were now ready to give satisfaction, and that it was entirely up to the
emperor how amends should be made in order to preserve the peace between
the two parties….</p></li>
<li><p>…The emperor, delayed by various affairs, remained at Aachen
until July 1. He finally decided to depart with his retinue for the
general assembly to be held at Worms in August. But before he left he
received the news that the Norseman planned to invade Saxony on the far
side of the Elbe and that their army was approaching our borders. On
hearing this he sent into all parts of Francia, ordering the general
levy of his people to follow him as fast as they could to Saxony. He
announced at the same time that he planned to cross the Rhine at Neuss
about the middle of July…. But when he found out that the rumor about
the Norsemen was false, he came to Worms in the middle of August, as had
been planned before….</p></li>
