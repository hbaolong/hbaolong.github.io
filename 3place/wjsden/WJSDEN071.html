<h4 id="irish-resistance-to-the-norsemen">45. Irish Resistance to the
Norsemen</h4>
<p>The War of the Irish against the Foreigners (Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib)
is an account of the ninth- and tenth-century Scandinavian invasions of
Ireland, and of the resistance to them by the Dál Cais dynasty of
Munster. It was compiled in the early twelfth century for the grandson
of the famous Dál Cais king Brian Boru, whose victory over the Dublin
Vikings at the battle of Clontarf in 1014 forms the climax of the work
(see doc. 107). It is, therefore, a dynastic propaganda text and by no
means an accurate or impartial version of events, but it remains
valuable for the attitudes toward the Vikings that it presents. The
first part of the work, from which the excerpts below are taken,
recounts the arrival of Viking fleets in different parts of Ireland. The
historicity of the “Turgeis” mentioned as the leader of a great royal
fleet in section 9 is debated by scholars; some regard him as a real
member of the Norwegian royal house, others as nothing more than a
legend.</p>
<p>Source: trans. J.H. Todd, The War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill, or
The Invasions of Ireland by the Danes and Other Norsemen (London:
Longmans, Green, Reader and Dyer, 1867), pp. 5–15.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>It was in the time of Airtri son of Cathal, and of Aedh son of
Niall, that the foreigners first began their devastation of Erinn; for
it was in their time that the foreigners came into Camas ó Fothaidh
Tire—namely, a hundred and twenty ships, and the country was plundered
and devastated by them, and Inis Labrainn and Dairinis were burned by
them. And the Eoganachts of Loch Lein gave them battle, when four
hundred and sixteen men of the foreigners were killed. This was the year
after that in which Diman of Aradh was killed, and ten years after the
death of Airtri, son of Cathal [812].</p></li>
<li><p>There came another fleet after that—namely, in the second year
after the accession to the throne of Feidhlim, son of Crimthann, and
they plundered Corach, and Inis Temhni; and Bennchair, and Cluain Uamha,
and Ros Maelain, were plundered by them. Scelleg Michil was also
plundered by them; and they took Edgall with them into captivity, and it
was by miracles he escaped, and he died of hunger and thirst with them
[824].</p></li>
<li><p>There came, after that, another fleet into the north of Erinn,
four years after the death of Aedh, son of Niall, at Ath-dá-Fert; and
they plundered Bennchur of Uladh [Bangor], and brake the shrine of
Comhgall, and killed its bishop, and its doctors, and its clergy: they
devastated also the plain [Co. Down].</p></li>
<li><p>Another fleet came to Ui Cennselaigh, and they plundered Teach
Munnu, and Teach Moling, and Inis Teoc. They afterwards went into
Osraighe, and the country was devastated by them. The Osraighe gave them
battle; and one hundred and seventy of them were killed there. [They]
demolished Dun Dermuighe and Inis Eoganain, and Disert Tipraiti; and
they devastated Leas Mor, and burned Cill Molaisi, and Cluan-ard Mubeoc;
Lann Leri, also, and Cenn Slebhi were plundered by another party of
them. [They] plundered also Sord-Colum-cilli, and Damliag Chianain,
Slaini, and Orlla-saile, and Glenn-dá-Locha, and Cluain Uamha, and
Mungairt, and the greater part of the churches of Erinn.</p></li>
<li><p>Another fleet came into the harbor of Luim-nech; and
Corco-Baiscinn, and Tradraighe, and Ui Conaill Gabhra were plundered by
them. The Ui Conaill defeated them at Senati, under Donnchadh, son of
Scann-lan, king of Ui Conaill, and Niall, son of Cennfaeladh, and it is
not known how many of them were slain there.</p></li>
<li><p>After that a great royal fleet came into the north of Erinn, with
Turgeis, who assumed the sovereignty of the foreigners of Erinn; and the
north of Erinn was plundered by them, and they spread themselves over
Leth Chuinn [the northern half of Ireland]. A fleet of them also entered
Loch Eathach, and another fleet entered Lughbudh, and another fleet
entered Loch Rai. Moreover, Ard Macha was plundered three times in the
same month by them; and Turgeis himself usurped the abbacy of Ard Macha,
and Farannan, abbot of Ard Macha, and chief comharba of Patrick, was
driven out, and went to Mumhain, and Patrick’s shrine with him; and he
was four years in Mumhain, while Turgeis was in Ard Macha, and in the
sovereignty of the north of Erinn, as Berchan prophesied, chief prophet
of heaven and earth,—</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Gentiles shall come over the soft sea;</p>
<p>They shall confound the men of Erinn;</p>
<p>Of them there shall be an abbot over every church;</p>
<p>Of them there shall be a king over Erinn.</p>
<p>Seven years shall they be; nor weak their power,</p>
<p>In the high sovereignty of Erinn.</p>
<p>In the abbacy of every church</p>
<p>The black Gentiles of Dubhlinn.</p>
<p>There shall be of them an abbot over this my church,</p>
<p>Who will not attend to matins;</p>
<p>Without Pater and without Credo;</p>
<p>Without Irish, but only foreign language.</p>
<p>Colum Cille also foretold the same thing when he said—</p>
<p>This fleet of Loch Rai,</p>
<p>By whom are magnified the Gaill-Gentiles;</p>
<p>Of them there shall be an abbot over Ard Macha;</p>
<p>It shall be the government of a usurper.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>The old Ciaran, of Saigher, foretold also the same—namely, that
Danars would three times conquer Erinn; that is, a party of them [in
punishment] for the banishment of Colum Cille; a party of them for the
insult to [Ciaran] himself at Tailltin; and a party for the fasting of
the Apostles in Temhair. And it was said of this poet and prophet
Bec-mac-De sang, as he said—</li>
</ol>
<p>When the bell was rung in warm Tailltin,</p>
<p>Ciaran the Old, the wealthy, of Saigher,</p>
<p>Promised [to Erinn] that three times there should be</p>
<p>Parties of Danars of the black ships.</p>
<p>And now these three predictions came to pass, and the prophecies were
fulfilled….</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li><p>There came [now Turgeis, of Ard Macha, and brought] a fleet upon
Loch Rai, and from thence plundered Midhe and Connacht; and Cluain Mic
Nois was plundered by him, and Cluain Ferta of Brennan, and Lothra, and
Tir-dá-glas, and Inis Celtra, and all the churches of Derg-dheirc, in
like manner; and the place where Ota, the wife of Turgeis, used to give
her audience was upon the altar of Cluain Mic Nois. The Connacht-men,
however, gave them battle, in which Maelduin, son of Muirghes, royal
heir apparent of Connacht, was slain.</p></li>
<li><p>After this came three score and five ships, and landed at
Dubhlinn of Athcliath, and Laghin was plundered to the sea by them, and
Magh Bregh. But the Dal Riada met them in another battle, in which
Eoghan, son of Oengus, king of Dal Riada was slain.</p></li>
<li><p>After this there came great sea-cast floods of foreigners into
Erinn, so that there was not a point thereof without a fleet. It was by
these that Bri-Gobhann was plundered, and Tressach, son of Mechill
killed. A fleet came to Ciarraighe Luachra, and all was plundered by
them to Cill Ita and Cuil Emhni; and the Martini of Mumhain were
plundered by the fleet of Luimnech, who carried off Farannan, Comharba
of Ard Macha, from Cluain Comairdi to Luimneach, and they broke
Patrick’s shrine.</p></li>
<li><p>It was in this year [845] that Turgeis was taken prisoner by
Maelsechlainn; and he was afterwards drowned in Loch Uair, namely, in
the year before the drowning of Niall Cailli, and the second year before
the death of Fedhlimidh, son of Crimthann, and it was in the time of
these two that all these events took place. Now, when Turgeis was
killed, Farannan, abbot of Ard Macha, went out of Mumhain [to Ard
Macha], and the shrine of Patrick was repaired by him….</p></li>
