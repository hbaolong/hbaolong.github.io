<h4 id="the-vikings-in-ireland-845917-aaaaaaaa">53. The Vikings in
Ireland, 845–917 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>By the middle of the ninth century, Scandinavians had established
permanent settlements in Ireland, including that at Dublin (Áth Cliath).
The Annals of Ulster (see doc. 42) for the years 845 to 917 is crucial
for shedding light on Viking activities in this period. Settlement made
the Vikings more vulnerable to Irish attack and also saw them drawn into
Irish politics, especially dynastic warfare. Powerful Viking rulers,
styling themselves kings, emerged, notably Amlaíb (Olaf) and Ímar (Ivar)
in the 850s to early 870s. These men were successful Viking leaders
whose influence was felt on both sides of the Irish Sea: Ímar (Ivar) has
been identified as one of the sons of Ragnar Hairy-Breeches, and he is
mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as one of the leaders of the
Great Army in England (see docs. 51, 52).</p>
<p>Some terms used in the Annals are problematic and require
clarification. The “Norse-Irish” or Gall-goídel mentioned in 856 and 857
seem to have been a group of mixed Norse and Gaelic blood who were
notorious for their violence. The terms “dark foreigners” and “fair
foreigners” (Dubgaill and Finngaill), mentioned in 851 and elsewhere,
are used only in Irish and Welsh sources of the ninth and tenth
centuries, and their meaning is the subject of much modern scholarly
discussion. It was once believed that these descriptions were used to
distinguish Norwegians and Danes, but such ethnic labels have been
rejected and the terms are now seen as a means of distinguishing
successive groups of Vikings or rival Viking dynasties or warbands.</p>

<li><p>Sitriuc, grandson of Ímar, landed with his fleet at Cenn Fuait on
the coast of Laigin. Ragnall, grandson of Ímar, with his second fleet
moved against the foreigners of Loch dá Chaech. A slaughter of the
foreigners at Neimlid in Muma. The Eóganacht and the Ciarraige made
another slaughter.</p></li>
<li><p>Niall son of Aed, king of Ireland, led an army of the southern
and northern Uí Néill to Munster to make war on the heathens. He halted
on the 22nd day of the month of August at Topar Glethrach in Mag Feimin.
The heathens had come into the district on the same day. The Irish
attacked them between the hour of tierce and midday and they fought
until eventide, and about a hundred men, the majority foreigners, fell
between them. Reinforcements [?] came from the camp of the foreigners to
aid their fellows. The Irish turned back to their camp in face of the
last reinforcement, i.e. Ragnall, king of the dark foreigners,
accompanied by a large force of foreigners. Niall son of Aed proceeded
with a small number against the heathens, so that God prevented a great
slaughter of the others through him. After that Niall remained twenty
nights encamped against the heathens. He sent word to the Laigin that
they should lay siege to the encampment from a distance. They were
routed by Sitriuc grandson of Ímar in the battle of Cenn Fuait, where
five hundred, or somewhat more, fell. And there fell too Ugaire son of
Ailill, king of Laigin, Mael Mórda son of Muirecán, king of eastern
Life, Mael Maedóc son of Diarmait, a scholar and bishop of Laigin, Ugrán
son of Cennéitig, king of Laíges, and other leaders and nobles.</p></li>

<li><p>Ketil Flatnose and his Descendants in the Hebrides</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Scandinavian settlement in the Hebrides, the numerous islands off
Scotland’s west coast, is undocumented in contemporary sources and must
be traced from archaeological and place-name evidence in the first
instance, but a significant Scandinavian presence there is not in doubt.
From the ninth century a series of rulers with Scandinavian names and
backgrounds began to appear in the region. Ketil Flatnose was a
prominent Norse sea-king associated with the Hebrides. He appears in
several Icelandic sagas, and some scholars believe he should be
identified with Caittil the Fair mentioned in the Annals of Ulster under
the year 857, while others doubt this association. The Icelandic saga
tradition is not entirely in agreement on his role either, but the
various sagas that mention him agree that he participated in an
expedition to the Western Isles and established himself there. On Ketil
and his descendants see doc. 20.</p>

<li>There was a distinguished hersir [chief, lord] in Norway, called
Ketil Flatnose. He was the son of Bjorn Buna [Club-Foot], who was the
son of Grim the hersir from Sogn. Ketil was married to Yngvild, the
daughter of Ketil Wether, a hersir from Raumarike. Their sons were
called Bjorn and Helgi, and their daughters were Aud [Unn] the
Deep-Minded, Thorunn Hyrna [Horned] and Jorunn Manvitsbrekka. Ketil’s
son, Bjorn, was fostered by Earl Kjallak in Jämtland [Norway]. The earl
was a wise and distinguished man, with a son called Bjorn, and a
daughter, Gjaflaug.</li>
</ol>
<p>This was in the days when Harald Finehair came to power in Norway.
Because of that turbulence, many noble men fled their ancestral estates
in Norway. Some went east over the Kiolen Mountains and others went west
across the sea. There were some who wintered in the Shetlands or the
Orkneys and raided Norway in the summers, doing great damage in King
Harald’s kingdom. The farmers complained to the king and asked him to
free them from this trouble. The king decided to get an army ready to
cross the western sea and said that Ketil Flatnose would be in command.
Ketil declined, but the king declared that he had to go. When Ketil saw
that the king intended to have his way, he got ready for the journey and
took with him his wife and those of his children who were at home.</p>
<p>After he had crossed to the west, Ketil fought several battles and
always won. He took control of the Hebrides and made himself ruler
there. Then he came to terms with the most powerful chiefs on that side
of the western sea and formed alliances with them. He sent the army back
east, and, when they met King Harald, they told him that Ketil Flatnose
was the ruler of the Hebrides, but declared that they did not know if he
would present the king with a kingdom across the western sea. When the
king heard that, he seized all that Ketil owned in Norway.</p>
<p>Ketil Flatnose gave his daughter, Aud, in marriage to Olaf the White,
who was the most powerful warlord in the west at that time. Olaf was the
son of Ingjald, who was son of Helgi; Ingjald’s mother was Thora, the
daughter of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye, who was the son of Ragnar
Hairy-Breeches. He married off his daughter, Thorunn Hyrna, to Helgi the
Thin, who was the son of Eyvind the Easterner and Raforta, the daughter
of Kjarval, king of Ireland.</p>
