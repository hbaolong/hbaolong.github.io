<h4 id="politics-in-harald-finehairs-norway-aaaaaaaa">4. Politics in
Harald Finehair’s Norway AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Egil’s Saga is the biography of Egil Skallagrimsson, poet, Viking,
and soldier, who lived from ca 910 until ca 990. The story begins in
Norway around the year 890, two generations before Egil’s birth, and
ends in Iceland with his death at age 80 in the last decade of the tenth
century. The following passage from the early part of the saga is set in
Norway and shows how Egil’s grandfather and uncles respond to the
increasing political ambitions of King Harald Finehair, who unified
Norway at the cost of driving many people overseas to lands such as
Iceland. The family’s difficulties appear against a background of social
upheaval caused by the struggle for the unification of Norway.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar,
ed. Sigurður Nordal, Íslenzk fornrit II (Reykjavík, 1933), pp. 3–27.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>There was a man called Ulf Bjalfason. His mother was Hallbera,
daughter of Ulf the Fearless. She was the sister of Hallbjorn Halftroll
from Hrafnista, father of Ketil Trout. Ulf was so big and strong a man
that no one could equal him. In his youth, he went on Viking voyages,
raiding for plunder. With him in partnership went Kari of Berle, a
well-born man, outstanding in strength and courage. He was a berserk
[see doc. 30]. Ulf and he had a common purse and were the closest of
friends.</li>
</ol>
<p>When they gave up raiding, Kari, now a very rich man, went back to
his estate at Berle. He had three children: a son called Eyvind Lamb,
another called Olvir Snubnose, and a daughter named Salbjorg, a girl of
outstanding beauty. Ulf married her and returned to his estate,
well-to-do in both land and money. He held the rank of landholder like
his forefathers before him and became a powerful man.</p>
<p>People say that Ulf was a first-rate farmer. He was in the habit of
getting up early to oversee his farmhands or his skilled workers and to
inspect his cattle and fields. Sometimes he would confer with men who
wanted his advice, for he was very wise and always gave good counsel.
But every day toward evening he became so ill-tempered that few dared
speak to him and he usually fell asleep. Rumor had it that he was a
shape-shifter; he was called Kveld-Ulf [Evening Wolf].</p>
<p>Kveld-Ulf and his wife had two sons. The elder was named Thorolf, and
the younger was called Grim. Both grew up to be big, strong men like
their father. Thorolf was a very handsome and accomplished man. Like his
mother’s kinsmen he was extremely sociable and open-handed, very
competitive, and impetuous in all that he did. He was popular with
everyone. Grim was a dark and ugly man, who took after his father in
both looks and character. He was very hard working and became a fine
craftsman, skilled in both woodwork and ironwork. In winter, he often
set off in his boat and went herring fishing with nets. Many of the
farmhands went with him.</p>
<p>When Thorolf was twenty, he prepared to go raiding and Kveld-Ulf
provided him with a longship. Kari’s sons Eyvind and Olvir decided to
join the expedition with a large company of men and a second longship.
In the summer they went raiding and each of them had a large share of
the plunder. For several summers they went on Viking expeditions and
spent the winters at home with their fathers. Thorolf brought home many
valuable objects and gave them to his mother and father. Those were good
times for a man in pursuit of plunder and glory. By then, Kveld-Ulf was
very old, but his sons were grown men.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>At this time, Audbjorn was king of Fjordane [a region of Norway].
Hroald was one of his earls, and Thorir was Hroald’s son. Another earl,
Atli the Slender, lived at Gaular. His children were Hallstein,
Holmstein, Herstein, and Solveig the Fair. One autumn when Gaular was
crowded for a sacrificial feast, Olvir Snubnose saw Solveig and paid
court to her. After a while, he asked for her hand in marriage, but the
earl would not give his consent because of the difference in their
ranks. After that, Olvir composed many love poems about Solveig and
became so obsessed with her that he gave up raiding. Only Thorolf and
Eyvind Lamb continued going on raids.</p></li>
<li><p>Harald, son of Halfdan the Black, succeeded his father in Vik
[region around Oslo Fjord], in the east. He had sworn not to cut or comb
his hair until he became sole king in Norway and so he was nicknamed
Harald Matted-Hair. First he fought and defeated the neighboring kings;
there are long accounts of this. Next, he took possession of Oppland and
from there advanced north toward Trondheim, fighting many battles before
he became sole ruler of the Trondelag. After this, he decided to go
north into Naumdal against the brothers Herlaug and Hrollaug who were
kings there. When the brothers heard of his advance, Herlaug and eleven
of his men entered a burial mound which they had spent three years
building. The mound was then closed up. King Hrollaug, however, gave up
his kingdom and adopted the rank of earl. He submitted to the power of
King Harald and relinquished his authority. So King Harald came into
possession of Naumdal and Halogaland and appointed men to oversee these
provinces.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>King Harald set out from Trondheim with a naval force and journeyed
south to Møre. There he fought and won a victory against King Hundjof
who fell in the battle. Then Harald took possession of North Møre and
Raumsdal, but Solvi Cleaver, Hundjof’s son, escaped to South Møre where
he asked King Arnvid for help, saying,</p>
<p>“Though this trouble has befallen us now, it won’t be long till the
same thing happens to you. For I think that Harald will get here
quickly, as soon as he has subdued and enslaved all the people of North
Møre and Raumsdal, as he will. You will have the same choice on your
hands as we did: either you can defend your property and freedom by
risking all the forces you can raise—and I, for my part, will volunteer
my men to help against this tyranny and injustice—or your other choice
is to follow the example of the men of Naumdal by going voluntarily into
bondage and making yourselves Harald’s slaves. My father thought it
glorious to die with honor on his own throne, rather than to become the
underling of another king in his old age. I think that you and other
proud and spirited men will think the same.”</p>
<p>Convinced by these persuasive words, the king determined to muster
troops and defend his kingdom. He and Solvi formed an alliance and sent
word to Audbjorn, king of Fjordane, asking for his support. When the
messengers reached him and delivered their message, Audbjorn took
counsel with his friends. They all advised him to gather together his
forces and join up with the men of Møre as requested. So King Audbjorn
had a war-arrow sent around his entire realm as a call to war and he
summoned his leading men to him by messenger.</p>
<p>When the messengers reached Kveld-Ulf and gave him the message that
the king had sent for him and all his men, he answered thus:</p>
<p>“If there’s a raid on Fjordane province, the king will think it my
duty to go with him and defend his land. However, I consider it no part
of my duty to go north to Møre and fight for the defense of their land.
Tell your king as soon as you meet him that Kveld-Ulf will sit out this
call to arms at home and won’t call up his troops or go off to fight
against Harald Matted-Hair. For, in my opinion, Harald has a great deal
of good luck while our king hasn’t even a handful.” The messengers
returned to the king and told him how their errand had turned out.
Kveld-Ulf stayed at home on his farm.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>King Audbjorn and his followers journeyed north to Møre and met up
with Arnvid and Solvi. Together they had a large force. By then, King
Harald had arrived from the north with his army, and they met opposite
Solskel Island where a great battle took place with heavy loss of life
on both sides. Harald lost two earls, Asgaut and Asbjorn, as well as
Grjotgard and Heralaug, the two sons of Earl Hakon of Lade, and many
other important men. Both King Arnvid and King Audbjorn from the army of
Møre were killed, but Solvi Cleaver escaped and afterwards became a
great Viking. He frequently inflicted extensive damage on King Harald’s
kingdom, thus earning himself the nickname Solvi Cleaver.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, King Harald subdued South Møre, but Vemund, Audbjorn’s
brother, hung onto power in the Fjordane district and made himself king
over it. Since it was late in the autumn, King Harald’s men advised him
not to advance south beyond Stad at that time. King Harald put Earl
Rognvald in charge of North and South Møre and Raumsdal. He himself
returned north toward Trondheim with a large band of followers.</p>
<p>That same autumn, Atli’s sons launched a raid against Olvir Snubnose,
intending to kill him. They had so large a force that Olvir could not
resist and had to take refuge in flight. He traveled north to Møre where
he met King Harald and entered his service. In the autumn, he went north
to Trondheim with the king and they developed a close friendship. Olvir
stayed with the king for a long time and became his skald.</p>
<p>That winter, Earl Rognvald took the inland route across Eid, and
south to Fjordane where he received intelligence about King Vemund’s
movements. One night when Vemund was at a feast in a place called
Naustdal, Earl Rognvald went there, attacked the house and burned the
king inside with ninety of his men.</p>
<p>After that, Kari of Berle joined Rognvald with a fully manned
longship and they both sailed north to Møre. Rognvald commandeered all
the ships that King Vemund had owned along with whatever goods he could
get his hands on. Then Kari from Berle continued north to Trondheim
where he met King Harald and became his man.</p>
<p>The following spring, King Harald sailed southwards along the coast
with a large naval force. He subdued Fjordane and Fjalir and appointed
his own men to oversee them, putting Earl Hroald in charge of Fjordane
province. After he had taken possession of the districts which had newly
come under his sway, King Harald kept a watchful eye on the landed men
and prominent farmers and anybody else he suspected might rise up
against him. Everyone was given three choices—they could enter his
service, leave the country, or face harsh treatment, even loss of life.
Indeed, some had their hands or feet cut off.</p>
<p>In every district, King Harald took possession of all the inherited
estates and all the land, inhabited and uninhabited. He took over the
sea and the lakes as well. All farmers had to become his tenants. All
foresters, saltworkers, and hunters both on sea and land had to pay him
tribute. Because of this oppression, many fled the country and settled
in uninhabited places both to the east in Jämtland and Hälsingland, and
in Vestrland [British Isles], the Hebrides, the Dublin shire, Ireland,
Normandy in France, Caithness in Scotland, the Orkneys, Shetlands, and
Faeroes. It’s at this time that Iceland was discovered.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>King Harald remained with his army in Fjordane. He sent
representatives throughout the land to contact those who had not joined
him but whom he felt should. The king’s messengers came to Kveld-Ulf and
were well received. They delivered the message that the king wanted
Kveld-Ulf to come and meet him.</li>
</ol>
<p>“He has heard tell,” they said, “that you are a distinguished man of
fine lineage. You will have the opportunity to receive great honors from
the king, for he is keen to surround himself with men who are famed for
their strength and valor.”</p>
<p>Kveld-Ulf answered that he was old and no longer capable of going out
in warships. “It’s time for me to stay at home and leave off serving
kings,” he said.</p>
<p>“Then your son should go to the king,” replied the messenger. “He is
a big, brave fellow. The king will make him a landed man if he enters
his service.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be a landed man while my father is alive,” said
Grim, “for he will be my overlord as long as he lives.”</p>
<p>The messengers returned to the king and told him what Kveld-Ulf had
said. The king lost his temper and spoke out in no uncertain terms. He
said they must be arrogant men and wondered what they were up to. Olvir
Snubnose was standing nearby and begged the king not to be angry. “I
will go and see Kveld-Ulf,” he said. “He’ll want to meet you when he
knows how much it means to you.”</p>
<p>Then Olvir went to Kveld-Ulf and told him that the king was angry.
The only way out, he said, was for either father or son to go to the
king who would honor them greatly if they paid homage to him. Olvir
spoke at length, saying truly that the king was generous to his men and
rewarded them with both wealth and honor. Kveld-Ulf said that he had a
presentiment, “that neither my sons nor I will have much luck with this
king so I won’t go to meet him. But if Thorolf comes home in the summer,
he will be easily persuaded to go to the king and become his man. Tell
the king that I will maintain friendly relations with him and so will
all the men who obey me. And if the king wants me to, I shall keep the
same right to rule on his behalf as I had from the last king. We’ll see
later how the king and I get along.”</p>
<p>Olvir returned and told the king that Kveld-Ulf would send one of his
sons, but that the one who was better suited was not at home. The king
let the matter rest. In summer he went across to Sogn, and in autumn he
got ready to travel north to Trondheim.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>In autumn, Thorolf Kveld-Ulfsson and Eyvind Lamb came home from a
Viking voyage and Thorolf went to live with his father. While father and
son were talking together, Thorolf asked Kveld-Ulf what Harald’s men had
wanted. Kveld-Ulf replied that the king had sent word that either he or
one of his sons should become the king’s man.</li>
</ol>
<p>“What was your answer?” asked Thorolf.</p>
<p>“I said what was on my mind. I made it clear that I would never enter
King Harald’s service and that neither would you two if it were up to
me. I think that we’ll all end up dead because of that king.”</p>
<p>“It won’t go that way at all,” said Thorolf. “I have high hopes of
earning great honor from him, so I’m determined to go and meet the king
and become his man. I know for certain that his court is filled with men
of the greatest valor and I am really keen to join that company if they
will have me, for those men are better off than anyone else in this
land. I have heard that the king is very liberal with gifts of money to
his men and that he’s quick to bestow advancement and power on those who
seem fit for it. I’m told also that those who turn their backs on him
and refuse his friendship never amount to anything. Some end up fleeing
the country, and others become hired workmen. You are a wise and
ambitious man, father, and I’m astonished that you are not delighted to
accept the honor the king has offered you. And if you think you can
foresee that this king will be our enemy and bring us misfortune, why
didn’t you fight against him alongside the king you used to serve? I
don’t think there’s any honor at all in being neither his friend nor his
enemy.”</p>
<p>“My predictions came true,” replied Kveld-Ulf. “Those who fought
Harald Matted-Hair north in Møre did not have a successful campaign.
Likewise you can be sure that Harald will inflict great harm on my kin.
But you’ll have to make up your own mind, Thorolf. I am quite confident
that if you join up with Harald’s retainers you will prove yourself up
to the mark and equal to any test of courage. Just take care not to be
too headstrong, and don’t compete with men greater than yourself, though
you mustn’t give in to them either.”</p>
<p>When Thorolf was ready to leave, Kveld-Ulf saw him to his ship. He
embraced him, and wished him a fond farewell and a safe reunion.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>At Torgar in Halogaland there lived a man called Bjorgolf, a landed
man, powerful and rich. By descent, he was half mountain-giant, as was
clear from his strength and size. He had a son just like himself,
Brynjolf by name. Bjorgolf was old and his wife was dead. He had
transferred control of all his affairs to his son and had sought a wife
for him. Brynjolf married Helga, daughter of Ketil Trout from Hrafnista.
They had a son named Bard who, from an early age, was well-built and
handsome and developed into a man of outstanding accomplishments.</li>
</ol>
<p>One autumn Bjorgolf and his son held a feast at Torgar. Many people
came, but the father and son were the most distinguished men present.
Every evening, as was the custom, people were paired by lot for
drinking. At the feast there was a man called Hogni who farmed on Leka.
He was very rich, handsome, and clever, but he was of humble birth, a
self-made man. He had a very beautiful daughter called Hildirid who drew
the lot to sit beside Bjorgolf. They found plenty to talk about in the
course of the evening and he thought her an attractive girl. Shortly
afterwards, the feast ended.</p>
<p>That same autumn, old Bjorgolf and thirty of his men set sail from
home in a ship he owned. He arrived at Leka and went up to the house
with twenty men while the other ten guarded the ship. When they reached
the farm, Hogni came out to meet him and welcomed him warmly. He invited
Bjorgolf and his crew to stay there. Bjorgolf accepted and they went
into the living room. When they had taken off their outdoor clothes and
put on tunics, Hogni had a large vessel of ale brought in and Hildirid
the farmer’s daughter served the guests.</p>
<p>Bjorgolf called Hogni to him and said, “I’m here to take your
daughter home with me and I want to have an informal wedding with her
right now.”</p>
<p>Hogni could see no other choice than to let Bjorgolf do what he
wanted. So Bjorgolf bought her for an ounce of gold and they went to bed
together. Then Bjorgolf took Hildirid home to Torgar. Brynjolf had
nothing good to say about the business.</p>
<p>Bjorgolf and Hildirid had two sons, Harek and Hroerek. Then Bjorgolf
died and, no sooner was he carried out for burial, than Brynjolf sent
Hildirid and her sons on their way. She went back to her father on Leka
and her sons were brought up there. They were handsome men, small in
stature and intelligent like their mother’s kin. Everyone referred to
them as the Hildiridarsons. Brynjolf had little regard for them and
allowed them nothing from their father’s inheritance, but Hildirid was
Hogni’s heir, so she and her sons inherited his property. They dwelt at
Leka and prospered there. Bard Brynjolfson was around the same age as
the Hildiridarsons. For years, Brynjolf and his father Bjorgolf had held
the right to travel among the Lapps and levy tribute from them.</p>
<p>North, in Halogaland, there is a fjord called Vefsnfjord and in this
fjord lies Alost, a large, fertile island on which there is a farm
called Sandness. There lived Sigurd, the richest man in that part of the
north. He was a landed man of shrewd intelligence. His daughter, Sigrid,
was regarded as the best match in Halogaland as she was an only child
and would be her father’s heir.</p>
<p>Bard Brynjolfson set off from home with a ship and thirty men. He
traveled north to Alost and paid a visit to Sigurd at Sandness. There he
made a formal proposal asking for Sigrid’s hand in marriage. His suit
was well received and Bard was promised the girl. The wedding was
arranged for the following summer when Bard was to go north again to
fetch his bride.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>That summer king Harald had sent word to the chief men of
Halogaland, summoning to his presence all those who had not yet been to
meet him. Brynjolf made up his mind to go and his son Bard went with
him. In the autumn, they traveled south to Trondheim where they met the
king, who gave them a warm welcome and made Brynjolf a landed man. The
king granted him great revenues in addition to those he already had. He
gave him the right to travel and trade among the Lapps as well as the
stewardship of the mountain areas. Afterwards, Brynjolf went home to his
estate, but Bard remained behind and became one of the king’s
retainers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of all his retainers, the king valued his skalds most highly, and
they were assigned a place of honor on the second high seat. Closest to
the center of the seat sat Audun the Plagiarist, who was the oldest
among them and had been skald to Halfdan the Black, King Harald’s
father. Next to him sat Thorbjorn Hornklofi and his neighbor was Olvir
Snubnose. Bard was assigned the place next to Olvir and came to be known
as Bard the White or Bard the Strong. Everyone thought well of him and
he and Olvir Snubnose became great friends.</p>
<p>That same autumn, Thorolf Kveld-Ulfsson and Eyvind Lamb, Kari of
Berle’s son, visited King Harald and got a warm welcome. They came in a
fast well-manned ship of twenty benches [forty oars]—a ship they had
used on Viking raids. They and their followers were assigned places in
the guest hall.</p>
<p>They stayed there until they thought it was time to meet the king.
Kari of Berle and Olvir Snubnose went with them. They greeted the king
and Olvir Snubnose informed him that Kveld-Ulf’s son had arrived:</p>
<p>“I told you in the summer that Kveld-Ulf would send him to you,” said
Olvir. “Kveld-Ulf is a man of his word and you can be sure that he will
be an excellent friend to you now that he has sent his son here to enter
your service—and what a fine-looking man Thorolf is, as you can see. We
all join Kveld-Ulf in asking you to treat Thorolf honorably and give him
an important position.”</p>
<p>The king replied favorably to this speech and said that he would do
what they asked, “as long as I find that Thorolf has the manly qualities
his brave appearance suggests.”</p>
<p>So Thorolf became one of the king’s retainers and joined his
household, while Kari of Berle and Eyvind Lamb his son went south in the
ship that Thorolf had brought north. After that, Kari returned to his
estate and so did Eyvind. Thorolf stayed behind with the king who
assigned him a seat between Olvir Snubnose and Bard. The three of them
became very close friends. It was the general opinion that Thorolf and
Bard were evenly matched for good looks, strength, stature, and
abilities, and both of them were now on the friendliest terms with the
king.</p>
<p>When winter was over and summer had arrived, Bard asked the king for
permission to go and fetch the bride who had been promised to him the
previous summer. As soon as the king knew that Bard had urgent business,
he allowed him to go home. When he had received this permission, Bard
asked Thorolf to travel north with him, declaring that he would meet
many noble relatives whom he had never met before or even been aware of.
Thorolf thought this was a good idea, so they got the king’s consent and
outfitted themselves for the journey with a fine ship and crew. Once
their preparations had been made, they went on their way.</p>
<p>They arrived at Torgar where they sent a message to Sigurd that Bard
would come north to fulfill the promises they had made the previous
summer. Sigurd replied that he would honor all their agreements and a
date was set for the wedding. Bard and his men were to go to Sandness
for the marriage. At the appointed time, Brynjolf and Bard set out and
with them went many important people, their relatives by birth and
marriage. As Bard had predicted, Thorolf met many relations whom he had
not known before. They traveled until they reached Sandness where a most
splendid feast was held. When the feast was over, Bard went home with
his wife and both he and Thorolf stayed there that summer. In autumn,
they went south to join the king and passed another winter with him.</p>
<p>That winter, Brynjolf died. When Bard found out that he had come into
his inheritance, he asked leave to go home and the king granted it.
Before they parted, Bard was made a landed man, as his father had been,
and the king granted him the rights to all the revenues that Brynjolf
had enjoyed. Bard went home to his estates and soon became a great
leader. Meanwhile the Hildiridarsons received no more of the inheritance
than they had got before. Bard and his wife had a son named Grim.
Thorolf remained with the king and enjoyed great honors.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>King Harald assembled a great naval force, gathering together men
and ships from far and wide. He left Trondheim and traveled south along
the coast. He had found out that a great army had been gathered from
Agder, Rogaland, and Hordaland as well as from many other areas of the
country, including the inland regions and Vik in the east. Many men of
consequence had assembled there intending to defend their land against
King Harald. The king headed south with his army, he himself sailing in
a large ship manned by his own retainers. In the prow stood Thorolf
Kveld-Ulfsson and Bard the White along with Olvir Snubnose and Eyvind
Lamb, the sons of Kari of Berle. Behind them in the fore part of the
ship were twelve of the king’s berserks. The battle took place in the
south at Hafrsfjord in Rogaland [ca 872]. It was the most terrible
battle King Harald had ever fought and there was great loss of life on
both sides.</li>
</ol>
<p>The king placed his ship in a forward position and that’s where the
battle was fiercest. It ended in victory for King Harald. Thorir Long
Chin, king of Agder, was killed there but Kjotvi the Wealthy fled along
with all of his surviving followers who had not surrendered after the
battle. When King Harald’s troops were counted, many were dead and many
were seriously injured. Thorolf was badly wounded and Bard’s injuries
were even worse. No one on the king’s ship forward of the sail was
unhurt, except for the berserks, whom weapons did not penetrate.</p>
<p>Then the king had the wounds of his men bound up. He thanked them for
their courage and gave them gifts, bestowing most praise on those he
thought most deserving and promising to increase their honor. In
particular, he mentioned the steersmen, and then the men in the prows
and the others stationed forward in the ships. This was the last battle
King Harald fought in his own lands. After that he met with no
resistance and gained control of the entire country.</p>
<p>The king ordered treatment for those of his men who seemed likely to
live and provided burial for the dead, according to the custom of the
time. Both Thorolf and Bard lay wounded, but while Thorolf’s wounds
began to heal, Bard’s became life-threatening. So he asked the king to
come to him.</p>
<p>“If I die of these wounds,” he said, “then I’d like your permission
to dispose of my inheritance myself.” When the king had agreed, Bard
continued, “I want Thorolf, my companion and kinsman, to inherit
everything I own, both land and money. I also want him to have my wife
and to bring up my son, because I trust him in these matters more than
any other man.” He settled these arrangements according to the laws and
with the king’s leave. Then Bard died. He was prepared for burial and
was greatly mourned.</p>
