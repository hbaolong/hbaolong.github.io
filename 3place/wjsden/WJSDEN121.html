Entertainment at a Wedding Feast at Reykjaholar from The Saga of
Thorgils and Haflidi AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The opening of the feast recalls various episodes of flyting
(dialogues consisting of verbal abuse) in Eddic poetry, notably
Lokasenna. The participants in the flyting at the wedding seem to know
what is expected of them, suggesting that such exchanges were not
unusual parts of festivities. On this occasion, the target of the abuse
is Thord Thorvaldsson, one of the wedding-guests. Thord has digestive
difficulties, which have an unfortunate effect on his breath. The latter
part of the wedding feast consists of the telling of tales and
recitation of poems.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Þorgils saga ok Halfliða in
Sturlunga saga, ed. Örnólfur Thorsson et al., 3 vols., Mál og Menning
(Reykjavík, 2010), vol. I, pp. 19–22.</p>
<ol start="17" type="1">
<li>…They were drinking heavily by now and they were all a bit far gone.
Talk became general, and people were aiming provocative verbal barbs at
one another, though not many of these jokes are preserved in this
tale.</li>
</ol>
<p>The story goes that Ingimund the Priest leaned over to his bench-mate
and spoke to him as if he were answering a question [in verse]:</p>
<p>The stench around the benches?</p>
<p>Stinking Thord’s at dinner.</p>
<p>This caused a great deal of laughter and considerable derision. When
it died down, Thord replied:</p>
<p>An ill-wind from Ingimund</p>
<p>wafts under the rafters.</p>
<p>With these taunts, the entertainment took a nasty turn, and
scurrilous verses were piled on one another. This one was aimed at
Thord:</p>
<p>There’s a grumbling in your godi’s [Thord’s]</p>
<p>gizzard and guts; around his air hole</p>
<p>the great man’s skin is sweating,</p>
<p>he groans with the effort.</p>
<p>Thord laughed loudly at this verse and immediately replied:</p>
<p>Bellows-blasts surge</p>
<p>from the bench there;</p>
<p>a pong is wafted</p>
<p>by your putrid wind.</p>
<p>Thorgils smiled, but didn’t respond to the taunt. Ingimund said that
one of their bench-companions should answer Thord. So, someone said
this:</p>
<p>No big matter</p>
<p>if we burp,</p>
<p>bench mates,</p>
<p>because of this beef;</p>
<p>Thord belches, though,</p>
<p>Thorvald’s son,</p>
<p>Kjartan’s son,</p>
<p>from consuming his own crap. [that is, regurgitating]</p>
<p>Thord looked toward the source of this verse…. He got up from the
table and sighed deeply without speaking. Someone interjected these
words:</p>
<p>All day the foul and smelly</p>
<p>stench from Billing’s wench’s</p>
<p>brutish son’s [that is, Thord’s] gut has</p>
<p>burped and boked in surges;</p>
<p>when the sharer of the serpent’s</p>
<p>store [Thord] forced up belches,</p>
<p>(the stink swamped the benches)</p>
<p>not a single nostril wasn’t stuffed by a finger.</p>
<p>It is not clear whether Thord heard this, but he and all his men
left…. As Thord was leaving, someone recited this:</p>
<p>The godi belched</p>
<p>and when we passed by</p>
<p>our hair stood on end</p>
<p>and everyone said fie.</p>
<p>It is said that Thord was accompanied to the door by this foul verse,
but it isn’t recorded that anyone suggested giving him gifts.</p>
<p>Now there was noisy good cheer, great entertainment and many kinds of
enjoyment. There was dancing, wrestling, and the telling of tales….</p>
<p>Though it isn’t of any great importance, accounts of these affairs
usually say something about who did the entertaining and what the
entertainment was. Now many contradict the facts of this account and
claim that they know nothing about it, for many deny the truth and call
truth lies and lies truth.</p>
<p>Hrolf from Skalmarness told a story about Hrongvid the Viking, about
Olaf the Warlord, about Thrain the Berserk, the burial-mound robber, and
about Hromund Gripsson—and included many verses. King Sverrir was
entertained by this saga and claimed that lying-sagas of this sort were
the most amusing. Be that as it may, many men can trace their lineage
back to Hromund Gripsson. Hrolf himself had put this saga together.
Ingimund the Priest told the story of Orm the Skald of Barra with many
fine verses: at the end of the saga was a group of excellent verses
composed by Ingimund himself. Many wise men regard this saga as
true.</p>
