<h4 id="introduction-aaaaaaaa">INTRODUCTION AAAAAAAA</h4>
<hr />
<p>This book provides a comprehensive and accessible one-volume
collection of primary documents that will be of use to instructors and
students as well as to the general reader interested in the Viking Age.
In assembling, translating, and arranging the materials presented here
we have been guided by the principle of providing as much breadth as
possible, both in the types of sources presented and in the geographic
and chronological coverage of the work. Of course, the vast amount of
material available, particularly the corpus of Icelandic saga texts,
means that it is impossible to include everything, and we are conscious
of omissions. Nevertheless, we hope that the documents presented here
will encourage readers to delve further into primary texts dealing with
the Vikings and the Viking Age.</p>
<p>The second edition of The Viking Age: A Reader largely preserves the
structure and content of the first edition, while adding both depth and
breadth to its coverage. This is accomplished through the revision of
some texts that were included in the first edition, as well as the
addition of new materials that enhance existing themes and topics or
else add new ones. In some instances these new materials introduce types
of evidence that were under-represented in the first edition,
particularly the lives of saints, translations of relics and
runestones.</p>
<p>Who, When, and Where Were the Vikings?</p>
<p>In the popular imagination, the Vikings are shaggy, unkempt,
ax-wielding thugs in horned helmets who raped, pillaged, and plundered
their way across Europe in the Early Middle Ages, nearly destroying
Western civilization in the process. They have been blamed for
everything from a decline in learning (thanks to the burning of
monasteries, places of learning) to the break-up of the Carolingian
empire that dominated Europe in the ninth century. So is the Viking
stereotype of the burly, destructive barbarian even remotely accurate?
As usual, the myth is far removed from reality. The shaggy Vikings were
not the unkempt louts of popular fiction, but a proud people who were
careful about their appearance. The horned helmets associated with the
Vikings in popular culture are a romantic invention of the nineteenth
century, and no helmets with horns are known from the Viking Age
anywhere in Europe. And, while a very small minority of early medieval
Viking Age Scandinavians might well have resembled the warriors and
bandits of the stereotype, their fellow Norsemen were also renowned
merchants, seamen, explorers, mercenaries, and poets, who contributed
much to early medieval European civilization.</p>
<p>Understanding the Vikings begins with understanding the word “Viking”
itself. In Old Norse (ON), the noun víkingr means a sea-borne pirate or
raider; víking means a sea-borne raid. The word Viking is, then, in the
technical sense, a job description, and it was a part-time job at that,
since Viking expeditions were undertaken seasonally by farmers,
fishermen, merchants, and the like, as a means of supplementing their
income. Few Scandinavians of the Viking Age would have thought of
themselves, or would have been described by others, as Vikings. In fact,
out of all those who suffered at the hands of marauding Scandinavians,
only the Anglo-Saxons actually named them wicingas. Common designations
in contemporary British and Irish, and European, records include the
terms “Northmen,” “foreigners,” and “heathens,” the latter a reference
to the fact that at the dawn of the Viking Age the Scandinavians had yet
to be converted to Christianity. It was not until the nineteenth
century, following the “rediscovery” of the Icelandic sagas and eddas
and their translation into English, that the term Viking passed into
common English use. Today the usefulness of the term is a subject of
debate among academics. In this collection, however, we adopt the term
in its widely accepted sense as a descriptor for the peoples of
Scandinavia in the period from the late eighth to the eleventh
centuries, not just for those who undertook sea-borne raiding; we use
the terms “Norse” and “Norsemen” in the same sense.</p>
<p>Vikings, then, were raiders, traders, farmers, and, later, settlers;
the activities were closely intertwined. In the course of the Viking
diaspora, Norsemen (and women) traveled westward across the North
Atlantic to North America and eastward down the Russian river systems to
Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul) and into the Islamic world.
Scandinavian trade flowed through Hedeby in Denmark, Visby and Birka in
Sweden, Kaupang in Norway, Novgorod in Russia, Kiev in the Ukraine, York
in England, and Dublin in Ireland. Scandinavians were thus important
traders from the Caspian Sea to Greenland. Accordingly, this text aims
to capture the astonishing geographic scope of the Viking world by
including materials relating to all of these regions.</p>
<p>The Viking Age is generally considered to have begun in the late
eighth century with the dramatic explosion of Scandinavian raiding
parties onto the European stage. The destruction of Lindisfarne Abbey in
Northumbria in the summer of 793 horrified Europe and, along with other
raids like it, shaped the European perception of the Vikings for many
centuries. For several decades Viking raiding parties terrorized most of
northern Europe, using hit-and-run tactics to target monasteries where
they could lay hands on easily portable wealth, along with captives who
could be enslaved or ransomed. But, within about 50 years of the
earliest recorded raids, raiding gave way to permanent settlement in
Britain, Ireland, and the Continent, as well as the North Atlantic
islands of the Faeroes, Iceland, and Greenland, which were given the
names by which they are still known. Around the year 1000, Norsemen were
the first Europeans to reach North America, exploring the region they
called Vinland the Good, probably the shores of the Gulf of
St. Lawrence. Indeed, Norse maritime activity of all kinds was at its
height during the so-called medieval warm period of ca 800–ca 1300, and
exploration of the North Atlantic was at least partly facilitated by the
comparative lack of pack ice in those years.</p>
<p>The end of the period is harder to place. The unification and
centralization of the Scandinavian states in the tenth and eleventh
centuries have been simultaneously blamed for increases in Viking
activity and credited with its cessation. However, a case could be made
for regarding some point during the eleventh century as bringing the
Viking Age to a close. The Battle of Clontarf (1014) emphasized the
waning power of Norsemen to do as they pleased in Ireland. The North Sea
empire of Knut (Cnut/Canute) the Great disintegrated with his death in
1035, and his conquests might be seen as the last great expedition of
the age of the Vikings. Another possibility is 1066, when King Harald
Hardradi of Norway failed disastrously in an attempt to invade England.
Harald was killed, and his army destroyed, at the Battle of Stamford
Bridge in the north of England. Raiding in England was never more than
half-hearted after the death of Harald and the arrival of William the
Conqueror.</p>
<p>All of these events may be regarded as stages in a slow process of
change. However, Norse activity in the British Isles continued until the
death of Hakon IV the Old (d. 1263). His doubtfully successful punitive
raid on Scotland was the last serious Scandinavian intervention in the
British Isles.</p>
<p>How Do We Know?</p>
<p>One major challenge is the dearth of literary materials from the
Vikings themselves in the early part of the Viking Age. It is not quite
fair to say, as is sometimes done, that the Vikings were illiterate at
the time the Scandinavian expansion began, since they did possess a
runic alphabet, the futhark, which was used in carving inscriptions on
stone, wood, bone or metal. Runic inscriptions are, by their very
nature, not suited to long narrative, however, and their study requires
a highly specialized background. Until recently, therefore, our
knowledge of the Vikings and their culture was shaped by the accounts of
their European enemies, who gave them a very bad press. English and
French chronicles are a major source of contemporary narratives of
Viking incursions.</p>
<p>However, from the nineteenth century onwards, translation into
English of medieval Icelandic sagas added another dimension to the study
of the Viking Age, allowing the Vikings to be appreciated from the
perspective of their own culture—or at least the culture of their
Christianized descendants in thirteenth-century Iceland. The narratives
of history and saga-literature frequently overlap, and this has tempted
many to find in the sagas a greater degree of historical factuality than
is justified. Nonetheless, the sagas are among the major ways in which
thirteenth-century Icelanders constructed their own and the wider
Scandinavian pasts. They were closer to the events than we are, and we
must concede to their writing, if not factuality, a high degree of
plausibility.</p>
<p>Two texts appear often in this reader: Egil’s Saga and Snorri
Sturluson’s Heimskringla, a History of the Kings of Norway. In order to
provide cohesiveness across the volume, many topics in the reader are
examined in part using Egil’s Saga, the biography of Egil
Skallagrimsson, a notable tenth-century Icelandic Viking and poet.
Snorri Sturluson (d. 1241) was a thirteenth-century Icelander of
outstanding ability, at once lawyer, diplomat, scholar, and poet.
Snorri’s Heimskringla covers much of Viking Age history, and does so
with both clarity and drama. In addition, Snorri interlaces his prose
with extensive quotations from court poets contemporary with the events
he narrates. While Heimskringla is no longer regarded as an absolutely
reliable historical source, it is important as a highly skillful blend
of history and popular legend. His Edda, too, is an indispensable source
for the study of Norse mythology and skaldic poetry. It has also been
suggested that he wrote Egil’s Saga.</p>
<p>European and Scandinavian material is complemented by documents from
the neighboring civilizations of Byzantium and Islam; in fact, Islamic
texts provide some of the most important descriptions of Scandinavians
and their customs in the tenth century. Understanding the Vikings, then,
necessarily involves the study of many texts and documents from many
different regions and periods, and written in many different languages.
An important aim of this collection is to highlight this geographic,
historical, and linguistic diversity of primary-source materials
relating to the Viking diaspora.</p>
<p>Some Notes on the Translations</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, all Old Norse and Anglo-Saxon texts are newly
translated for this reader. As is usual, the names of persons are
anglicized: for example, Egill appears as Egil, and Guðrún as
Gudrun.</p>
<p>In Old Norse texts, an individual is often identified as the son or
daughter of his or her father: for example, Guðrún Ósvífrsdóttir,
anglicized here as Gudrun Osvifrsdaughter, or Egill Skalla-Grímsson,
anglicized as Egil Skallagrimsson. A few names, such as Hákon or
Sigurðr, have a different form and are anglicized as Hakonarson and
Sigurdarson when used to express the patronymic, as in Hakon Hakonarson
or Harald Sigurdarson.</p>
<p>In the headings of chapters and sections of chapters, the titles of
Norse texts are given in their original form in parentheses after the
customary English translation: for example, Egil’s Saga (Egils saga
Skalla-Grímssonar).</p>
<p>Where placenames have well-known English forms, these are generally
used: for example, York replaces Jórvík, and Reykjavik replaces
Reykjarvík.</p>
<p>Only two symbols from Old Norse are likely to cause confusion on the
rare occasions when they are used here: Ð, ð: pronounced th as in that;
Þ,þ: pronounced th as in thin.</p>
