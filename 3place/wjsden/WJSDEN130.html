<h4 id="the-conversion-of-the-icelanders">93. The Conversion of the
Icelanders</h4>
<p>The conversion of the Icelanders was a largely political event,
carried out as a response to Norwegian pressure. This conversion was
remarkably peaceful in comparison with others in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Íslendingabók, ed. Jakob
Benediktsson, Íslenzk fornrit I (Reykjavík, 1986), pp. 14–18.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>King Olaf, the son of Tryggvi, the son of Olaf, the son of Harald
Finehair, introduced Christianity to Norway and Iceland. He sent here
the priest called Thangbrand, who instructed people in Christianity and
baptized everyone who adopted the faith. Hall Thorsteinsson from Sida
was baptized early on, and so were Hjalti Skeggjason from Thjorsardal,
Gizur the White, the son of Teit, the son of Ketilbjorn from Mosfell,
along with many other chieftains. However, more people argued against
the faith and rejected it.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Thangbrand had been here for a year or two, he left as he had
killed two or three men who had scurrilously made fun of him, and when
he arrived in Norway, he told King Olaf what had happened to him and
said also that Christianity was not likely to catch on in Iceland. King
Olaf was furious and, on this account, decided to torture or kill any of
our countrymen who were in Norway. The same summer Gizur and Hjalti
travelled to Norway from Iceland and had those men released by the king.
They promised him their help in a fresh attempt to have Christianity
adopted here, and they said that they had every expectation of being
listened to.</p>
<p>They traveled to Iceland the following summer with a priest called
Thormod, and, after a successful journey, arrived at Vestmannaeyjar
[Westerners’ Islands] when ten weeks of summer had passed. Teit used to
give this account, and he was there himself.</p>
<p>The previous summer, it had been declared law that men were to attend
the Althing after ten weeks of summer; before then, they had come a week
earlier. So they left Vestmannaeyjar and traveled inland to the Althing,
but they had Hjalti stay behind in Laugardal with eleven men as he had
been sentenced to lesser outlawry for blasphemy at the Althing the
previous summer. The reason was that he had recited this verse at the
law rock,</p>
<p>I won’t mock the mighty gods,</p>
<p>but I reckon Freya’s a real bitch.</p>
<p>Gizur and his companions kept going until they came to the place
called Vellankatli, near Olfossvatn. From there they sent a message to
the Thing [here, the Althing, or national assembly], summoning all their
supporters to meet them, for they had heard that their opponents
intended to bar them from Thingvellir by force. Before they left, Hjalti
rode up with the men who had stayed behind with him. They all rode off
to the Thing and, on the way, met the friends and relatives whom they
had asked to join them. The heathen men crowded together fully armed,
and the sides were so close to violence that it was anyone’s guess
whether a battle would break out.</p>
<p>Next day, Gizur and Hjalti went to the Law Rock to present their
case, and the story goes that it was astonishing how well they expressed
themselves. However, the result was that one man after another named
witnesses, and both sides, Christians and heathens, declared themselves
not bound by the laws of the others. At that, they left the Law
Rock.</p>
<p>Then the Christian men asked Hall of Sida to proclaim as their laws
those that would be in accord with Christianity, but Hall got himself
out of it and struck a deal with Thorgeir the Lawspeaker that he would
declare what the law was to be. Thorgeir was still a heathen at that
time.</p>
<p>When everyone returned to their booths, Thorgeir lay down and covered
himself with his cloak. He lay like this, without saying a word, all
that day and the following night. Next morning, he got up and sent word
that everyone was to go to the Law Rock. When they had assembled,
Thorgeir began speaking, and told them he considered that their affairs
were in a sorry state if they could not all have the same law code
throughout the land. He used many arguments to exhort them not to let
this happen, saying that it would lead to trouble and that there was a
strong likelihood of civil unrest, which would ruin the country. He
pointed to the kings of Norway and Denmark who had carried on
hostilities until their subjects made peace between them, though the
kings themselves did not want to. That agreement turned out so well
that, in a short time, the kings were exchanging splendid gifts and the
peace held as long as they lived.</p>
<p>“And I think it would be a good idea,” said Thorgeir, “not to leave
the decision to the extremists, but to arrive at a compromise, so that
each side gets something and we all have one law and a single faith. For
sure, if we tear up the law, we tear up the country.”</p>
<p>He ended his speech, and both sides agreed that they would all have a
single law code, which would be what he decided to announce.</p>
<p>Then it was passed into law that everyone was to be Christian and
that baptism was to be given to anyone in the country who was still
unbaptized. From among the old laws were preserved the right to expose
infants and the eating of horseflesh. Private sacrifice was still
allowed, but there would be a penalty of lesser outlawry if there were
any witnesses. A few years later this heathen practice was abolished
like the others.</p>
<p>Teit told us that this was how Christianity came to Iceland. That
same summer, Olaf Tryggvason died, according to Saemund the priest. Olaf
fought against Svein Haraldsson, king of Denmark, Olaf Eiriksson, the
Swede, and Hakon’s son, Eirik, who was later earl in Norway. That was
one hundred and thirty years after the killing of King Edmund, and one
thousand after the birth of Christ, as it is generally reckoned.</p>
