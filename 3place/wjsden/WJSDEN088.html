A Muslim Diplomat Meets Rūs Merchants on the Volga River AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Vikings appear in many Islamic sources. Perhaps the most famous,
and detailed, is that of Ibn Fadlān, a member of an embassy sent by the
caliph of Baghdad to the king of the Bulgars on the Volga River in 921.
His account, known as the Risāla [Writing], described the journey and
the peoples with whom the embassy came into contact, including a group
called the Rūs who were encountered on the upper reaches of the Volga in
922. The identity of these Rūs is the subject of debate: often regarded
as Scandinavians, they were probably undergoing processes of cultural
adaptation and assimilation by which they became Slavicized by the
mid-eleventh century.</p>
<p>Source: trans. James E. Montgomery, “Ibn Fadlān and the Rūsiyyah,”
Journal of Arabic and Islamic Studies 3 (2000), pp. 1–25.
http://www.uib.no/jais/v003ht/03-001-025Montgom1.htm</p>
<p>I saw the Rūsiyyah when they had arrived on their trading expedition
and had disembarked at the River ātil. I have never seen more perfect
physiques than theirs—they are like palm trees, are fair and reddish,
and do not wear the qurṭaq or the caftan. The man wears a cloak with
which he covers one half of his body, leaving one of his arms uncovered.
Every one of them carries an axe, a sword and a dagger and is never
without all of that which we have mentioned. Their swords are of the
Frankish variety, with broad, ridged blades. Each man, from the tip of
his toes to his neck, is covered in dark-green lines, pictures and such
like. Each woman has, on her breast, a small disc, tied
<around her neck>, made of either iron, silver, copper or gold, in
relation to her husband’s financial and social worth. Each disc has a
ring to which a dagger is attached, also lying on her breast. Around
their necks they wear bands of gold and silver. Whenever a man’s wealth
reaches ten thousand dirhams [an Islamic silver coin], he has a band
made for his wife; if it reaches twenty thousand dirhams, he has two
bands made for her—for every ten thousand more, he gives another band to
his wife. Sometimes one woman may wear many bands around her neck. The
jewellery which they prize the most is the dark-green ceramic beads
which they have aboard their boats and which they value very highly:
they purchase beads for a dirham a piece and string them together as
necklaces for their wives.</p>
<p>They are the filthiest of all Allāh’s creatures: they do not clean
themselves after excreting or urinating or wash themselves when in a
state of ritual impurity (i.e., after coitus) and do not <even> wash
their hands after food. Indeed they are like asses that roam
<in the fields>.</p>
<p>They arrive from their territory and moor their boats by the ātil (a
large river), building on its banks large wooden houses. They gather in
the one house in their tens and twenties, sometimes more, sometimes
less. Each of them has a couch on which he sits. They are accompanied by
beautiful slave girls for trading. One man will have intercourse with
his slave-girl while his companion looks on. Sometimes a group of them
comes together to do this, each in front of the other. Sometimes indeed
the merchant will come in to buy a slave-girl from one of them and he
will chance upon him having intercourse with her, but <the Rūs> will not
leave her alone until he has satisfied his urge. They cannot, of course,
avoid washing their faces and their heads each day, which they do with
the filthiest and most polluted water imaginable. I shall explain. Every
day the slave-girl arrives in the morning with a large basin containing
water, which she hands to her owner. He washes his hands and his face
and his hair in the water, then he dips his comb in the water and
brushes his hair, blows his nose and spits in the basin. There is no
filthy impurity which he will not do in this water. When he no longer
requires it, the slave-girl takes the basin to the man beside him and he
goes through the same routine as his friend. She continues to carry it
from one man to the next until she has gone round everyone in the house,
with each of them blowing his nose and spitting, washing his face and
hair in the basin.</p>
<p>The moment their boats reach this dock every one of them disembarks,
carrying bread, meat, onions, milk and alcohol, and goes to a tall piece
of wood set up <in the ground>. This piece of wood has a face like the
face of a man and is surrounded by small figurines behind which are long
pieces of wood set up in the ground. <When> he reaches the large figure,
he prostrates himself before it and says, “Lord, I have come from a
distant land, bringing so many slave-girls <priced at> such and such per
head and so many sables <priced at> such and such per pelt.” He
continues until he has mentioned all of the merchandise he has brought
with him, then says, “And I have brought this offering,” leaving what he
has brought with him in front of the piece of wood, saying, “I wish you
to provide me with a merchant who has many dīnārs and dirhams and who
will buy from me whatever I want <to sell> without haggling over the
price I fix.” Then he departs. If he has difficulty in selling
<his goods> and he has to remain too many days, he returns with a second
and third offering. If his wishes prove to be impossible he brings an
offering to every single one of those figurines and seeks its
intercession, saying, “These are the wives, daughters and sons of our
Lord.” He goes up to each figurine in turn and questions it, begging its
intercession and grovelling before it. Sometimes business is good and he
makes a quick sell, at which point he will say, “My Lord has satisfied
my request, so I am required to recompense him.” He procures a number of
sheep or cows and slaughters them, donating a portion of the meat to
charity and taking the rest and casting it before the large piece of
wood and the small ones around it. He ties the heads of the cows or the
sheep to that piece of wood set up in the ground. At night, the dogs
come and eat it all, but the man who has done all this will say, “My
Lord is pleased with me and has eaten my offering.”</p>
<p>When one of them falls ill, they erect a tent away from them and cast
him into it, giving him some bread and water. They do not come near him
or speak to him, indeed they have no contact with him for the duration
of his illness, especially if he is socially inferior or is a slave. If
he recovers and gets back to his feet, he rejoins them. If he dies, they
bury him, though if he was a slave they leave him there as food for the
dogs and the birds.</p>
<p>If they catch a thief or a bandit, they bring him to a large tree and
tie a strong rope around his neck. They tie it to the tree and leave him
hanging there until <the rope> breaks, <rotted away> by exposure to the
rain and the wind.</p>
<p>I was told that when their chieftains die, the least they do is to
cremate them. I was very keen to verify this, when I learned of the
death of one of their great men. They placed him in his grave and
erected a canopy over it for ten days, until they had finished making
and sewing his <funeral garments>.</p>
<p>In the case of a poor man they build a small boat, place him inside
and burn it. In the case of a rich man, they gather together his
possessions and divide them into three, one third for his family, one
third to use for <his funeral> garments, and one third with which they
purchase alcohol which they drink on the day when his slave-girl kills
herself and is cremated together with her master. (They are addicted to
alcohol, which they drink night and day. Sometimes one of them dies with
the cup still in his hand.)</p>
<p>When their chieftain dies, his family ask his slave-girls and
slave-boys, “Who among you will die with him?” and some of them reply,
“I shall.” Having said this, it becomes incumbent upon the person and it
is impossible ever to turn back. Should that person try to, he is not
permitted to do so. It is usually slave-girls who make this offer.</p>
<p>When that man whom I mentioned earlier died, they said to his
slave-girls, “Who will die with him?” and one of them said, “I shall.”
So they placed two slave-girls in charge of her to take care of her and
accompany her wherever she went, even to the point of occasionally
washing her feet with their own hands. They set about attending to the
dead man, preparing his clothes for him and setting right all he needed.
Every day the slave-girl would drink <alcohol> and would sing merrily
and cheerfully.</p>
<p>On the day when he and the slave-girl were to be burned I arrived at
the river where his ship was. To my surprise I discovered that it had
been beached and that four planks of birch and other types of wood had
been erected for it. Around them wood had been placed in such a way as
to resemble scaffolding. Then the ship was hauled and placed on top of
this wood. They advanced, going to and fro <around the boat> uttering
words which I did not understand, while he was still in his grave and
had not been exhumed.</p>
<p>Then they produced a couch and placed it on the ship, covering it
with quilts <made of> Byzantine silk brocade and cushions <made of>
Byzantine silk brocade. Then a crone arrived whom they called the “Angel
of Death” and she spread on the couch the coverings we have mentioned.
She is responsible for having his <garments> sewn up and putting him in
order and it is she who kills the slave-girls. I myself saw her: a
gloomy, corpulent woman, neither young nor old.</p>
<p>When they came to his grave, they removed the soil from the wood and
then removed the wood, exhuming him <still dressed> in the izār
[garment] in which he had died. I could see that he had turned black
because of the coldness of the ground. They had also placed alcohol,
fruit and a Pandora [a musical instrument similar to a lute] beside him
in the grave, all of which they took out. Surprisingly, he had not begun
to stink and only his colour had deteriorated. They clothed him in
trousers, leggings, boots, a qurṭaq, and a silk caftan with golden
buttons, and placed a silk qalansuwwah [cap] <fringed> with sable on his
head. They carried him inside the pavilion on the ship and laid him to
rest on the quilt, propping him with cushions. Then they brought
alcohol, fruit and herbs and placed them beside him. Next they brought
bread, meat and onions, which they cast in front of him, a dog, which
they cut in two and which they threw onto the ship, and all of his
weaponry, which they placed beside him. They then brought two mounts,
made them gallop until they began to sweat, cut them up into pieces and
threw the flesh onto the ship. They next fetched two cows, which they
also cut up into pieces and threw on board, and a cock and a hen, which
they slaughtered and cast onto it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the slave-girl who wished to be killed was coming and
going, entering one pavilion after another. The owner of the pavilion
would have intercourse with her and say to her, “Tell your master that I
have done this purely out of love for you.”</p>
<p>At the time of the evening prayer on Friday they brought the
slave-girl to a thing that they had constructed, like a door-frame. She
placed her feet on the hands of the men and was raised above that
door-frame. She said something and they brought her down. Then they
lifted her up a second time and she did what she had done the first
time. They brought her down and then lifted her up a third time and she
did what she had done on the first two occasions. They next handed her a
hen. She cut off its head and threw it away. They took the hen and threw
it on board the ship.</p>
<p>I quizzed the interpreter about her actions and he said, “The first
time they lifted her, she said, ‘Behold, I see my father and my mother.’
The second time she said, ‘Behold, I see all of my dead kindred,
seated.’ The third time she said, ‘Behold, I see my master, seated in
Paradise. Paradise is beautiful and verdant. He is accompanied by his
men and his male-slaves. He summons me, so bring me to him.’” So they
brought her to the ship and she removed two bracelets that she was
wearing, handing them to the woman called the “Angel of Death,” the one
who was to kill her. She also removed two anklets that she was wearing,
handing them to the two slave-girls who had waited upon her: they were
the daughters of the crone known as the “Angel of Death.” Then they
lifted her onto the ship but did not bring her into the pavilion. The
men came with their shields and sticks and handed her a cup of alcohol
over which she chanted and then drank. The interpreter said to me,
“Thereby she bids her female companions farewell.” She was handed
another cup, which she took and chanted for a long time, while the crone
urged her to drink it and to enter the pavilion in which her master lay.
I saw that she was befuddled and wanted to enter the pavilion but she
had <only> put her head into the pavilion
<while her body remained outside it>. The crone grabbed hold of her head
and dragged her into the pavilion, entering it at the same time. The men
began to bang their shields with the sticks so that her screams could
not be heard and so terrify the other slave-girls, who would not, then,
seek to die with their masters.</p>
<p>Six men entered the pavilion and all had intercourse with the
slave-girl. They laid her down beside her master and two of them took
hold of her feet, two her hands. The crone called the “Angel of Death”
placed a rope around her neck in such a way that the ends crossed one
another and handed it to two <of the men> to pull on it. She advanced
with a broad-bladed dagger and began to thrust it in and out between her
ribs, now here, now there, while the two men throttled her with the rope
until she died.</p>
<p>Then the deceased’s next of kin approached and took hold of a piece
of wood and set fire to it. He walked backwards, with the back of his
neck to the ship, his face to the people, with the lighted piece of wood
in one hand and the other hand on his anus, being completely naked. He
ignited the wood that had been set up under the ship after they had
placed the slave-girl whom they had killed beside her master. Then the
people came forward with sticks and firewood. Each one carried a stick
the end of which he had set fire to and which he threw on top of the
wood. The wood caught fire, and then the ship, the pavilion, the man,
the slave-girl and all it contained. A dreadful wind arose and the
flames leapt higher and blazed fiercely.</p>
<p>One of the Rūsiyyah stood beside me and I heard him speaking to my
interpreter. I quizzed him about what he had said, and he replied, “He
said, ‘You Arabs are a foolish lot!’” So I said, “Why is that?” and he
replied, “Because you purposely take those who are dearest to you and
whom you hold in highest esteem and throw them under the earth, where
they are eaten by the earth, by vermin and by worms, whereas we burn
them in the fire there and then, so that they enter Paradise
immediately.” Then he laughed loud and long. I quizzed him about that
&lt;i.e., the entry into Paradise&gt; and he said, “Because of the love
which my Lord feels for him. He has sent the wind to take him away
within an hour.” Actually, it took scarcely an hour for the ship, the
firewood, the slave-girl and her master to be burnt to a fine ash.</p>
<p>They built something like a round hillock over the ship, which they
had pulled out of the water, and placed in the middle of it a large
piece of birch on which they wrote the name of the man and the name of
the King of the Rūs. Then they left.</p>
<p>He (Ibn Faḍlān) said: One of the customs of the King of the Rūs is
that in his palace he keeps company with four hundred of his bravest and
most trusted companions; they die when he dies and they offer their
lives to protect him. Each of them has a slave-girl who waits on him,
washes his head and prepares his food and drink, and another with whom
he has coitus. These four hundred <men> sit below his throne, which is
huge and is studded with precious stones. On his throne there sit forty
slave-girls who belong to his bed. Sometimes he has coitus with one of
them in the presence of those companions whom we have mentioned. He does
not come down from his throne. When he wants to satisfy an urge, he
satisfies it in a salver. When he wants to ride, they bring his beast up
to the throne, whence he mounts it, and when he wants to dismount, he
brings his beast <up to the throne> so that he can dismount there. He
has a vicegerent who leads the army, fights against the enemy and stands
in for him among his subjects.</p>
