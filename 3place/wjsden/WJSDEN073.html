<h4 id="the-northmen-in-france-843865-aaaaaaaa">47. The Northmen in
France, 843–865 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Annals of St-Bertin covers the years 830 to 882 and is an
important source for the ninth-century Carolingian world. This set of
annals was produced in the 830s as a court chronicle under Louis the
Pious and was later continued by Prudentius of Troyes and Hincmar of
Rheims. This selection illustrates the scope and intensity of Viking
activities on the Continent, as well as the responses of Carolingian
kings, local rulers, and even peasants.</p>
<p>Source: trans. Janet L. Nelson, The Annals of St-Bertin.
Ninth-century Histories, vol. 1 (Manchester and New York: Manchester
University Press, 1991), pp. 55–129, excerpts.</p>
<ol start="843" type="1">
<li><p>Northmen pirates attacked Nantes, slew the bishop and many clergy
and lay people of both sexes, and sacked the civitas [city]. Then they
attacked the western parts of Aquitaine to devastate them too. Finally
they landed on a certain island [probably Noirmoutier], brought their
households over from the mainland and decided to winter there in
something like a permanent settlement.</p></li>
<li><p>The Northmen sailed up the Garonne as far as Toulouse, wreaking
destruction everywhere, without meeting any opposition. Then some of
them withdrew from there and attacked Galicia, but they perished, partly
because they met resistance from missile-throwers, partly because they
were caught in a storm at sea. Some of them, though, got to the
south-western part of Spain, where they fought long and bitterly with
the Saracens, but were finally beaten and withdrew to their
ships.</p></li>
<li><p>A very hard winter. In March, 120 ships of the Northmen sailed up
the Seine to Paris, laying waste everything on either side and meeting
not the least bit of opposition. Charles [the Bald] made efforts to
offer some resistance, but realized that his men could not possibly win.
So he made a deal with them: by handing over to them 7,000 lb [of
silver] as a bribe, he restrained them from advancing further and
persuaded them to go away….</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Horic, king of the Northmen, sent 600 ships up the Elbe in Germany
against Louis [the German]. The Saxons opposed them, and when battle was
joined, by the help of our Lord Jesus Christ, emerged victorious. The
Northmen went away from there, and attacked and captured a certain
civitas of the Slavs [possibly Hamburg]….</p>
<p>The Northmen went back down the Seine to the open sea. Then they
devastated all the coastal regions, plundering and burning. God in his
goodness and justice, so much offended by our sins, had thus worn down
the lands and kingdoms of the Christians. Nevertheless, so that the
pagans should no longer go unpunished in falsely accusing the most
all-powerful and most provident Lord of improvidence and even
powerlessness, when they were going away in ships loaded with booty from
a certain monastery [St. Germain] which they had sacked and burned, they
were struck down by divine judgment either with blindness or insanity,
so severely that only a very few escaped to tell the rest about the
might of God. It is said that their king Horic was so disturbed when he
heard about this that he sent envoys to King Louis for peace talks, and
was ready to release all the captives and make every effort to restore
the stolen treasures….</p>
<p>The Danes, who had ravaged Aquitaine the year before, returned and
attacked Saintonge. They won the fight, and settled down there to stay
quietly for a while.</p>
<ol start="846" type="1">
<li><p>Danish pirates went to Frisia, extracted as large a tribute as
they wanted and then fought a battle which they won. As a result they
gained control of the whole province….</p></li>
<li><p>The Danes came to the western region of Gaul where the Bretons
live, defeated them in three battles, and completely overpowered them.
Nominoë [leader of the Bretons], beaten, fled with his men; later he
softened up the Danes with bribes and got them out of his
territories….</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Irish, who had been attacked by the Northmen for a number of
years, were made into regular tribute-payers. The Northmen also got
control of the islands all around Ireland, and stayed there without
encountering any resistance from anyone….</p>
<p>Danes attacked and plundered the coastal regions of Aquitaine. They
laid siege to the town of Bordeaux for a long time. Another group of
Danes occupied and took possession of the emporium [trading center,
market town] called Dorestad and the island of Betuwe [just south of
Dorestad].</p>
<ol start="848" type="1">
<li><p>Charles attacked the contingent of Northmen who were besieging
Bordeaux and manfully defeated them…. In Aquitaine some Jews betrayed
Bordeaux to the Danes: having taken the town, they ravaged and burned
it.</p></li>
<li><p>Horic, king of the Northmen, was attacked by two of his nephews
and war ensued. The nephews were induced to make peace by a partition of
the realm. Roric, the nephew of Harald, who had recently defected from
Lothar, raised whole armies of Northmen with a vast number of ships and
laid waste Frisia and the island of Betuwe and other places in that
neighborhood by sailing up the Rhine and the Waal. Lothar, since he
could not crush Roric, received him into his allegiance and granted him
Dorestad and other counties. Another band of Northmen plundered the
inhabitants of Mempisc, Thérouanne and other coastal districts, while
yet others attacked the island of Britain….</p></li>
<li><p>…Danish pirates ravaged Frisia and the inhabitants of Betuwe.
Running amok right up to the monastery of St-Bavo which they call Ghent,
they burned the monastery and then after reaching Rouen they proceeded
on foot as far as Beauvais which they burned. On their way back, they
were intercepted by our forces and some of them were killed [these
events are dated to 852 by other sources].</p></li>
<li><p>Godefrid, son of Harald the Dane who had once been baptized at
Mainz in the emperor Louis’s time [826], now defected from Lothar and
took himself off to his own people. He collected a strong force from
among them, and attacked Frisia with a large number of ships, then went
to the area around the River Scheldt, and finally to the Seine. Lothar
and Charles came up to meet him with their whole army, and blockaded him
from either bank of the Seine.</p></li>
<li><p>During this blockade they celebrated Christmas. But the men in
Charles’s contingent did not want to fight, so he had to withdraw having
achieved no advantage at all. Charles got Godefrid to make peace with
him on certain agreed conditions. But the rest of the Danes settled down
there right through March without needing to feel the least anxiety:
they ravaged, burned and took captives all the more savagely for being
completely unrestrained….</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In July the Danes left the Seine and went to the Loire where they
sacked the town of Nantes and the monastery of St-Florent and its
neighborhood….</p>
<p>On 8 November Danish pirates from Nantes heading further inland
brazenly attacked the town of Tours and burned it, along with the church
of St-Martin, and other neighboring places. But because the attack had
been known about beforehand with complete certainty, the body of
St-Martin had already been taken away to the monastery of Cormery and
the treasures of his church to the civitas of Orléans.</p>
<ol start="854" type="1">
<li>The Danes stayed on the Loire. They sailed up as far as the
stronghold of Blois which they burned. Their aim was to reach Orléans
and wreak the same havoc there. But Bishop Agius of Orléans and Bishop
Burchard of Chartres got ready ships and warriors to resist them; so the
Danes gave up their plan and headed back to the lower waters of the
Loire. Other Danish pirates also laid waste the part of Frisia next door
to Saxony.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Danes fought amongst themselves in a civil war. They battled like
madmen in a terribly stubborn conflict lasting three days. When King
Horic and other kings with him had been slain, almost the entire
nobility perished too. Pirates of the Northmen came up the Loire again
and burned the civitas of Angers.</p>
<ol start="855" type="1">
<li>Lothar gave the whole of Frisia to his son Lothar, whereupon Roric
and Godefrid headed back to their native Denmark in the hope of gaining
royal power….</li>
</ol>
<p>The Northmen attacked Bordeaux, a civitas in Aquitaine, and moved
about all over the countryside at will….</p>
<p>The Northmen sailed up the Loire. They left their ships and tried to
reach Poitiers on foot. But the Aquitanians came up to meet them and
beat them so soundly that hardly more than 300 of them escaped. Roric
and Godefrid, on whom success had not smiled, remained based at Dorestad
and held sway over most of Frisia.</p>
<ol start="856" type="1">
<li>On 18 April, Danish pirates came to Orléans, sacked it and went away
again without meeting any opposition….</li>
</ol>
<p>In mid-August, other Danish pirates again sailed up the Seine. They
ravaged and plundered the civitates, monasteries and villae [farms] on
both banks of the river, and even some civitates further away. Then they
chose a place on the bank of the Seine called Jeufosse, an excellent
defensive site for a base camp, and there they quietly passed the
winter.</p>
<ol start="857" type="1">
<li>On 28 December [856] Danish pirates attacked Paris and burned it.
Those pirates who were based in the region of the lower Loire sacked
Tours and all the surrounding districts as far as the stronghold of
Blois….</li>
</ol>
<p>The Danes who were coming up the Seine ravaged everything unchecked.
They attacked Paris where they burned the church of Sts-Peter and
Genevieve and all the other churches except for the cathedral of
St-Stephen, the Church of Sts-Vincent and Germain and also the church of
St-Denis: a great ransom was paid in cash to save these churches from
being burned. Other Danes stormed the emporium called Dorestad and
ravaged the whole island of Betuwe and other neighboring districts….</p>
<p>As the Danes attacked his civitas, Frotbald bishop of Chartres fled
on foot and tried to swim across the river Eure but he was overwhelmed
by the waters and drowned.</p>
<ol start="858" type="1">
<li>Bjørn, chief of one group of the pirates on the Seine, came to King
Charles at the palace of Verberie, gave himself into his hands and swore
fidelity after his own fashion. Another group of those pirates captured
Abbot Louis of St-Denis along with his brother Gauzlin, and demanded a
very heavy fine for their ransom. In order to pay this many church
treasuries in Charles’s realm were drained dry, at the king’s command.
But even all this was far from being enough: to bring it up to the
required amount, large sums were eagerly contributed also by the king,
and by all the bishops, abbots, counts and other powerful men….</li>
</ol>
<p>The Danes attacked Saxony but they were repulsed….</p>
<p>In July, King Charles came to the island of Oissel in the Seine [just
south of Rouen], to besiege the Danes ensconced there. There the Young
Charles, his son, arrived from Aquitaine and along with him came Pippin,
now a layman…. In August too, King Lothar hastened to that same island
of Oissel, to bring help to his uncle. They stayed there till 23
September, without making any progress in the siege. Then they went
home….</p>
<ol start="859" type="1">
<li>The Danes ravaged the places beyond the Scheldt. Some of the common
people living between the Seine and the Loire formed a sworn association
amongst themselves, and fought bravely against the Danes on the Seine.
But because their association had been made without due consideration,
they were easily slain by our more powerful people….</li>
</ol>
<p>Danish pirates made a long sea-voyage, sailed through the straits
between Spain and Africa and then up the Rhône. They ravaged some
civitates and monasteries, and made their base on an island called the
Camargue….</p>
<p>Danes launched new attacks [in the autumn], and laid waste, by firing
and plundering, the monastery of St-Valery [sur-Somme], the civitas of
Amiens, and other places round about. Others of them also attacked with
the same fury the island in the Rhine called Betuwe.</p>
<p>Those who were still on the Seine made a night attack on the civitas
of Noyon. They took captive Bishop Immo along with other nobles, both
clerics and laymen, and after laying waste the civitas carried the
prisoners off with them and slew them on their march. Two months
earlier, they had also killed Ermenfrid bishop of Beauvais at a certain
villa, and the previous year they had slain Baltfrid, bishop of
Bayeux.</p>
<p>For fear of those same Danes, the bones of the blessed martyrs Denis,
Rusticus, and Eleutherius were removed to Nogent [sur-Seine], one of the
villae belonging to St-Denis in the Morvois district. There on 21
September the bones were reverently placed in reliquaries.</p>
<ol start="860" type="1">
<li>King Charles, deceived by the empty promises of the Danes on the
Somme, ordered a tax to be levied on the treasures of the churches and
on all mansi [small farms] and on traders—even very small-scale ones:
even their houses and all their equipment were assessed so that the
tribute could be levied on them. For the Danes had promised that if
3,000 lb of silver, weighed out under careful inspection, were handed
over to them, they would turn and attack those Danes who were busy on
the Seine and would either drive them away or kill them….</li>
</ol>
<p>The Danes on the Somme, since the above-mentioned tribute was not
paid to them, received hostages, and then sailed over to attack the
Anglo-Saxons by whom, however, they were defeated and driven off. They
then made for other parts. The Danes who were still on the Rhône got as
far as the city of Valence, ravaging as they went. There they destroyed
everything around, and then returned to the island on which they had
made their base….</p>
<p>The Danes who had been on the Rhône made for Italy, where they took
Pisa and other civitates, sacked them and laid them waste.</p>
<ol start="861" type="1">
<li>In January, the Danes burned Paris and with it the church of
Sts-Vincent the Martyr and Germain the Confessor. Also, traders who were
fleeing back up the Seine by ship were chased and captured. Other Danish
pirates came to the district of Thérouanne and ravaged it….</li>
</ol>
<p>The Danes had lately come back from the English and burned
Thérouanne. Under Weland’s command, they now sailed up the Seine with
over 200 ships, and besieged the fort built by the Northmen on the
island of Oissel with those Northmen inside it too. To support the
besiegers, Charles ordered a levy to be raised from his realm to bring
in 5,000 lb of silver and a large amount of livestock and corn, so that
the realm should not be looted….</p>
<p>Meanwhile the other group of Danes with sixty ships sailed up the
Seine and into the Tellas and from there they reached those who were
besieging the fort, and joined up with them. The besieged were forced by
starvation, filth, and general misery to pay the besiegers 6,000 lb made
up of gold and silver and to make an alliance with them. So they sailed
away down the Seine as far as the sea. But they were prevented from
putting out to sea by the winter now coming on. So they split up
according to their brotherhoods [possibly kin-groups] into groups
allocated to various ports, from the sea-coast right up to Paris. Weland
with his company came up the Seine to the fort of Melun. Former
occupants of the besieged fort, with Weland’s son, now occupied the
monastery of St-Maur-des-Fossés.</p>
<ol start="862" type="1">
<li>…Charles arrived at Senlis, where he waited, expecting the people to
assemble there so that troops could be positioned along both banks of
certain rivers, namely the Oise, Marne, and Seine, and defensive
measures taken to stop the Northmen from coming up to plunder. But
Charles now received word that a select force of Danes, picked from
amongst those encamped at Fossés, was making for Meaux with a few ships.
Charles made all speed in that direction with those men whom he had with
him. But he could not catch up with them, because the bridges had been
destroyed and the ships taken over by the Northmen. He therefore
followed some indispensable advice and rebuilt the bridge across to the
island by Trilbardou, thereby cutting the Northmen’s access to the way
down the river. He also assigned squadrons to guard both banks of the
Marne. The Northmen, now tightly hemmed in by these moves, gave hostages
chosen by Charles, and on his orders: the conditions were that they
should return without any delay all the captives they had taken since
sailing up the Marne, and either, on some prearranged assemblydate,
should withdraw from the Seine with the other Northmen, and should seek
the open sea, or, if the others would not withdraw with them, should
unite with Charles’s army to attack those who refused to go. Thus, when
ten hostages had been given, they were allowed to return to their own
people. About twenty days later, Weland himself came to Charles and
commended himself to him, while he and the men he had with him swore
solemn oaths in their own way. Then he returned to the ships and with
the whole Danish fleet sailed down the Seine to Jumièges, where they
decided to repair their ships and await the Spring equinox. When the
ships had been repaired, the Danes made for the open sea, and split up
into several flotillas which sailed off in different directions
according to their various choices. Most of them made for the Bretons,
who live in Neustria with Salomon as chief; and these Danes were joined
by the ones who had been in Spain. Salomon hired twelve Danish ships for
an agreed fee, to use against Robert. These Robert captured on the river
Loire and slew every man in the fleet, except for a few who fled into
hiding. Robert, unable now to put up with Salomon any longer, made an
alliance against Salomon with the Northmen who had just left the Seine,
before Salomon could ally with them against him. Hostages were
exchanged, and Robert paid them 6,000 lb of silver.</li>
</ol>
<p>Weland with his wife and sons came to Charles, and he and his family
became Christians.</p>
<p>…Charles caused all the leading men of his realm to assemble about 1
June, with many workmen and carts, at the place called Pîtres, where the
Andelle from one side and the Eure from the other flow into the Seine
[Pont-de-l’Arche, dep. Eure]. By constructing fortifications on the
Seine, he closed it off to ships sailing up or down the river. This was
done because of the Northmen….</p>
<ol start="863" type="1">
<li>In January Danes sailed up the Rhine toward Cologne, after sacking
the emporium called Dorestad and also a fairly large villa at which the
Frisians had taken refuge, and after slaying many Frisian traders and
taking captive large numbers of people. Then they reached a certain
island near the fort of Neuss [near Xanten]. Lothar came up and attacked
them with his men along one bank of the Rhine and the Saxons along the
other and they encamped there until about the beginning of April. The
Danes therefore followed Roric’s advice and withdrew by the same way
they had come….</li>
</ol>
<p>[After 25 October] two Northmen who had recently left their ships
with Weland and come asking to be baptized as Christians now
revealed—and it afterwards turned out to be true—that this had been a
trick, and they accused Weland of bad faith. So, according to the custom
of their people, one of the Northmen challenged him to single combat in
King Charles’s presence, and killed him in the fight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile he [King Charles] received news that the Northmen had come
to Poitiers, and though the city was ransomed, they had burned the
church of the great confessor Saint Hilary….</p>
<ol start="864" type="1">
<li>Charles arranged his troops and ordered the Aquitanians to advance
against the Northmen who had burned the church of St-Hilary….</li>
</ol>
<p>The Northmen got to Clermont where they slew Stephen, son of Hugh,
and a few of his men, and then returned unpunished to their ships.
Pippin, son of Pippin [II, king of Aquitaine], who had changed back from
being a monk to become a layman and an apostate, joined company with the
Northmen and lived like one of them [he was later captured and
executed].</p>
<p>Lothar, son of Lothar, raised 4 denarii [denarius, a silver coin]
from every manse in his whole kingdom, and handed over the sum in cash,
plus a large quantity of flour and livestock and also wine and cider, to
the Northman Rodulf, son of Harald, and his men, all this being termed a
payment for service [these were probably the Northmen who sailed up the
Rhine in 863]….</p>
<p>Northmen sailed to Flanders with a large fleet, but when they met
with resistance from the local people, they sailed up the Rhine and laid
waste the neighboring regions of the kingdoms of Lothar and Louis on
both banks of the river….</p>
<p>Then Charles ordered fortifications to be constructed there [at
Pîtres] on the Seine to prevent the Northmen from coming up the
river….</p>
<p>Robert, count of Anjou, fought against two companies of Northmen who
were based on the Loire. Of one, he slew every man, except for a few who
got away; the other larger group attacked from behind, and Robert was
wounded, and having lost a few of his men, he decided to withdraw….</p>
<ol start="865" type="1">
<li>…Northmen based on the Loire made their way up the river with a
favorable wind, divine judgment thus making it easy for them, to launch
a fullscale attack. They reached the monastery of St-Benedict known as
Fleury and burned it. On their way back they burned Orléans and the
monasteries both in the civitas and round it, except for the church of
the Holy Cross which, despite great efforts on the part of the Northmen,
the flames proved unable to consume. So they sailed back down the river
and after ravaging all the neighboring districts they returned to their
base….</li>

<p>From Attigny [in mid-July] Charles marched to resist the Northmen who
had sailed up the Seine with fifty ships….</p>
<p>The Northmen on the Loire made their way on foot to Poitiers without
meeting any resistance, burned the civitas and returned to their ships
unscathed. But Robert slew more than 500 of these Northmen based on the
Loire, without losing any of his own men, and sent to Charles the
standards and weapons captured from the Northmen.</p>
<p>Charles, for his part, came up to the place called Pîtres where the
Northmen still were. Now there were bridges over the Oise and the Marne
at two places called Auvers and Charenton, but the local people who had
built them long ago could not repair them because of the attacks of the
Northmen. On the advice of his faithful men, Charles therefore ordered
these bridges to be repaired by men drafted from more distant regions to
perform labor services in order to complete the fortifications on the
Seine, but on condition that this was treated as a special case of
urgent need and that the men who would now repair these bridges should
never at any future time suffer any disadvantage through performing
labor services on this particular job. Guards were assigned to keep
watch on both banks of the Seine. Then in mid-September, Charles moved
to the villa of Orville to do some hunting. But the guards still had not
taken up their positions on this [the east] bank of the Seine, so those
Northmen dispatched about 200 of their number to Paris to get wine.
Failing to find what they sought there, they came back to their people
who had sent them, without suffering any losses. More than 500 of them
planned to advance from there beyond the Seine to sack Chartres, but
they were attacked by the troops guarding the west bank of the Seine and
after losing some men killed and some wounded, they retreated to their
ships….</p>
<p>[Charles] received news [while en route from Cologne to Quierzy]…that
on the 18 October, Northmen had got into the monastery of St-Denis,
where they stayed for about twenty days, carrying off booty from the
monastery to their ships each day, and after much plundering without
encountering resistance from anyone at all, they returned to their camp
not far from the monastery.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Northmen on the Loire joined forces with Bretons and
attacked Le Mans. They sacked it without opposition, and sent back to
their ships. The Aquitanians fought with Northmen based on the Charente
under their leader Sigfrid, and slew about 400 of them: the rest fled
back to their ships.</p>
