<h4 id="vikings-in-the-iberian-peninsula-aaaaaaaa">50. Vikings in the
Iberian Peninsula AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Spanish and Islamic sources provide information on ninth- and
tenth-century Viking activities in the Christian kingdoms of Galicia and
Asturias and in the Islamic Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba in the Iberian
Peninsula, which experienced Viking raids in 844–845, 859–861, 964–966,
and 968–971. Ibn al-Kutia (d. 977) lived in Cordoba and was the author
of a historical work on the History of the Conquest of Andalusia, which
dealt with the period from the Islamic conquest to the early tenth
century. Little is known of the life of Ibn Idhari, a Moroccan whose
history of the Maghreb and Iberia of ca 1300 contains important
information extracted from earlier works now lost. The Vikings were
known in Al-Andalus (Islamic Spain) as madjus, in reference to their
polytheistic religion. The following passages use the Islamic calendar,
which numbers the years from the migration of the Prophet from Mecca to
Medina (622 CE). Gregorian dates are given in parentheses.</p>
<p>Source: trans. J. Stefánsson, “The Vikings in Spain. From Arabic
(Moorish) and Spanish Sources,” Saga Book of the Viking Club VI, Pt. 1
(Jan. 1909), pp. 33–36, 37–39.</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>Ibn al-Kutia. Year 230 (17 September 844–1 October 845)</li>
</ol>
<p>Abd al-Rahman [II, Umayyad Emir of Cordoba, 822–852] built the great
Mosque in Seville, and when the walls of this city had been destroyed by
Madjus in 230 he rebuilt them. The arrival of these barbarians struck
terror into the heart of the inhabitants. All fled and sought a refuge,
partly in the mountains of the neighborhood, partly in Carmona. In all
the west there was none who dared to meet them in battle. Therefore the
inhabitants of Cordoba and the nearest districts were called to arms as
soon as Madjus had landed on the coast in the farthest west, and had
seized the plains of Lisbon. Our leaders with their troops took up a
position at Carmona, but, as the enemy was uncommonly brave, they dared
not attack them before the arrival of soldiers from the border…. The
border chieftains demanded news of the movements of the enemy, and the
commander answered that Madjus sent every day detachments toward
Firrich, Lacant, Cordoba, and Moron. They [the chieftains] then asked,
if there were not, near Seville, a place where they could lie in ambush
without being seen. The commander told them of the village
Quintos-Maâfir, south-east of Seville. They moved there in the middle of
the night, and sat in ambush. One of their men, with a bundle of
faggots, was set to keep watch from the tower of the village church. At
sunrise the guard made known that a host of 16,000 Madjus was marching
on Moron. The Moslem let them pass, cut them off from Seville, and cut
them down. Then our leaders advanced, entered Seville, and found its
commander besieged in the castle. They joined forces, and the
inhabitants returned to the city in multitudes.</p>
<p>Besides the host that had been cut down, two other hosts of Madjus
had moved out, one toward Lacant, the other toward the quarter of the
tribe of Beni-’l-Laith in Cordova. But when the Madjus who remained in
Seville saw the Muslim army coming, and heard of the disaster that the
detachment marching on Moron had met with, they suddenly embarked. When
they were sailing up the river toward a castle, they met their
countrymen, and when these had also embarked, they all together began to
sail down the river, while the inhabitants of the country poured on them
curses and threw stones at them. When they had arrived a mile (league)
below Seville, Madjus shouted to the people, “Leave us in peace, if you
wish to buy prisoners of us.” People then ceased to throw stones at
them, and they allowed everybody to ransom prisoners. A certain sum was
paid for most of them, but Madjus refused both gold and silver. They
took only clothes and food.</p>
<p>After this the Emir Abd al-Rahman took measures of safety. He built
an arsenal in Seville, ordered ships to be built, and gathered sailors
on the coasts of Andalos; to these he gave very high wages, and provided
them with war engines and naphtha. When Madjus returned next, in 244 [19
April 858–7 April 859], during the reign of Emir Mohammed, battle was
given them at the mouth of the river [Guadalquivir], and when they had
been beaten and several of their ships burnt, they departed.</p>
<ol start="2" type="a">
<li>Ibn Adhari. Year 229 (30 September 843–17 September 844)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the year 229 a letter arrived in the capital [Cordoba] from
Wahballah ibn-Hazm, governor at Lisbon. He wrote therein that Madjus had
been seen on the coast of his province, in 54 ships, and in the same
number of smaller vessels. Abd al-Rahman gave to him, as to other
governors in provinces adjoining the sea, authority to take all needful
measures.</p>
<p>Madjus arrived in about 80 ships. One might say they had, as it were,
filled the ocean with dark red birds, in the same way as they had filled
the hearts of men with fear and trembling. After landing at Lisbon, they
sailed to Cadiz, then to Sidona, then to Seville. They besieged this
city, and took it by storm. After letting the inhabitants suffer the
terrors of imprisonment or death, they remained there seven days, during
which they let the people empty the cup of bitterness.</p>
<p>As soon as Abd al-Rahman had news of this, he gave to the Hadjib
[Prime Minister] Isâ ibn-Chohaid the command of the cavalry. Moslems
hastened to gather under the banner of this general, and to join him as
closely as the eyelid is joined to the eye. Abjullah ibn-Kolaib, Ibn
Wasim, and other great chieftains also joined the cavalry. The
commander-in-chief made Axarafe [a high hill near Seville] his
headquarters, and wrote to the governors all round to command them to
call their men to arms. They went to Cordoba, and the eunuch Nasr took
them to the army.</p>
<p>But Madjus continually received reinforcements, and, according to the
author of the book, Bahdja, an-n-afs, they continued for thirteen days
to kill men and drag women and children into slavery. Instead of
thirteen days, the author of Dorar al-Kalayid says seven days, and we
have followed him above. After some skirmishes with Moslems they
[Madjus] went to Kaptel [an island in the Guadalquivir] where they
stayed three days. They then entered Caura [Coria], twelve miles from
Seville, where they murdered many people. Then they took Talyata, two
miles from Seville. There they spent the night, and were seen next
morning at Al-Fakkharin [Alfarache]. Then they re-embarked and joined
battle with Moslems, who were put to flight and lost so many men that
they could not be numbered. After returning to their ships, Madjus
sailed to Sidona, and then to Cadiz, after Abd al-Rahman had sent his
generals against them and fought them, sometimes successfully, sometimes
with loss. At last, when war engines were used against them, and
reinforcements had arrived from Cordoba, Madjus were put to flight. They
[the Moors] killed about 500 of their men, and took four of their ships
with all their cargoes. Ibn-Wazim had these burnt, after selling all
that was found in them. Then they [Madjus] were defeated at Talyata on
the 25 Safar of this year [11 November 844]. Many were killed, others
hanged at Seville, others hanged in the palm trees of Talyata, and
thirty of their ships were burnt. Those who escaped from the bloodshed
embarked. They went to Niebla, and then to Lisbon, and were no more
heard of. They arrived at Seville on the 14 Moharram, 230 [1 October
844], and forty-two days had passed from the day when they entered
Seville until those of them who were not put to the sword departed.
Their general was killed. To punish them for their crimes, God gave them
to our sword and destroyed them, numerous as they were. When they had
been annihilated, the government made this happy event known through all
the provinces, and Abd al-Rahman also wrote to the Cinhadja tribe in
Tanger, to tell them that with God’s help he had succeeded in destroying
Madjus. At the same time he sent them the heads of the general, and of
two hundred of the noblest Madjus warriors.</p>

<p>“The Heathens Stayed”: From Raiding to Settlement</p>
<p>By the middle of the ninth century, chroniclers in Ireland and
England began to observe with a certain amount of surprise and shock
that parties of Vikings were beginning to overwinter in those regions.
This ushered in the beginning of a new phase of activity characterized
by the establishment of a permanent Scandinavian presence in the British
Isles and continental Europe. Many scholars regard this period of
settlement as a “Second Viking Age” quite distinct from the “First
Viking Age” of raiding. Settlement did not occur at the same time or in
the same way, in the same concentration, or with the same effect across
Europe, and it is much better documented in some regions than in
others.</p>
