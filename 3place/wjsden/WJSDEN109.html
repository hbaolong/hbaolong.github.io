<h4 id="advice-for-sailors-and-merchants">79. Advice for Sailors and
Merchants</h4>
<p>The first part of the thirteenth-century Norwegian text Konungs
skuggsjá (Speculum Regale) or King’s Mirror (see doc. 70) consists of a
father providing all sorts of useful advice to his son. Much of the
advice in this section relates to how a prospective merchant should
behave when abroad.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Speculum Regale.
Konungs-Skuggsjá, ed. R. Keyser, P.A. Munch, C.R. Unger (Christiania
[Oslo]: Akademiske Collegium ved det kongelike norske
Frederiks-Universitet, 1848), pp. 5–9, 51–53.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>…If you are staying in market towns…and you don’t know how buying
and selling is done there, observe carefully how those who are reputed
to be the best and most successful merchants carry on their trading.
When you are buying, take a careful look at the merchandise before
clinching the deal, in case it is damaged or flawed in any way. And
whenever you seal a bargain, always have a few trustworthy men present
to witness the transaction….</li>
</ol>
<p>You should occupy yourself with business matters until breakfast
time, or until mid-day if necessary, and afterwards you should sit down
to a meal. Set your table with white cloths, fresh food, and good drink,
and eat well if you can afford it. After lunch, take a nap, or go for a
walk, either for your own amusement, or to see what other reputable
merchants are up to, or to find out if any new goods have arrived in
town that you might want to buy. When you get back to your lodgings,
take a careful look at the goods you have to sell and make sure that
none of them have been damaged while in your possession. If there is any
damage and you are going to sell the goods, don’t hide the defect from
the buyer. Instead, show him the damage and make the best deal you can.
That way, you won’t get a reputation as a swindler. Set a high price on
your goods, one as close as possible to what you think you can get, but
don’t set the price too high or you’ll be regarded as a profiteer.</p>
<p>Whenever you have a spare moment, devote some time to your studies,
especially to the study of law…. If you want to be a merchant, you must
have a good grasp of all lawcodes, but you’ll need to have a more
thorough grasp of the Bjarkey code than of any other. If you know the
law, no one will be able to use legal trickery against you if you bring
lawsuits against your peers, and you will be able to plead according to
the law in every case.</p>
<p>Though I am speaking mainly about the law, I don’t consider anyone to
be well-informed unless he has a thorough knowledge and understanding of
the people he is living amongst. If you want to be really erudite, you
must learn all languages, especially Latin and French, which are the
most widely used languages. Do not, however, neglect your own speech or
language.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>There are some habits that you must guard against and avoid like the
devil himself—these are drinking, gaming, whoring, brawling, and
betting—for these practices are at the root of the worst evils, and few
people can avoid sin or censure for long unless they guard against these
habits.</li>
</ol>
<p>You must observe the movements of the heavenly bodies, and make a
careful study of how the sky is illuminated, how night is divided from
day, and how day is divided into several time-periods. You must also
learn how to monitor the sea-surge and understand the significance of
its ebbings and swellings, because that is essential knowledge for
seafaring men. And you should make a thorough study of arithmetic,
because merchants need to make frequent use of it….</p>
<p>Don’t hang onto your trade goods too long, if you can get rid of them
at a decent price, for merchants usually buy regularly, and sell on
quickly….</p>
<p>If you are getting ready for an overseas trading-trip, and you own
your own ship, tar it thoroughly in the autumn, and keep it tarred all
winter if you can. But if your ship is laid up on blocks too late to be
tarred in the autumn, tar it in the early spring, and then leave it
until it dries out completely. Always buy shares in good ships, or don’t
buy them at all. Keep your ship looking smart, so that able men will
choose it, and you’ll have a competent crew. Get your ship ready early
in the summer and sail when the weather is at its best. Always make sure
that the gear on your ship is in good repair, and don’t stay at sea late
into the autumn, if you can help it….</p>
<p>There are one or two minor points still to be mentioned. Whenever you
go to sea, take two or three hundred ells of vadmal [homespun woollen
cloth] with you—the kind suitable for sail-mending—in case it’s needed.
Take lots of needles and a good supply of thread and ropes. It may seem
trifling to mention these things, but they are often needed on a
journey. You should always take along plenty of nails, both large ones
and rivets, in the requisite sizes for your ship. And you’ll also need
good grapnels, adzes, chisels and augers, as well as all the other tools
used in ship-building. Whenever you go on a trading voyage in your own
ship, you must always remember to take everything I have mentioned….</p>
<p>If you start making a lot of money, divide it up and form
partnerships in places that you don’t go to yourself, but choose your
partners carefully….</p>
<p>If you have a large amount of money invested in trade, divide it into
three parts. Use a third of it to buy partnerships with men who are
permanent residents of market towns; make sure that these men are
trustworthy and experienced in trade. Put the other two thirds into
several different trading ventures, for if your money is invested in a
variety of ventures, it’s unlikely that you will suffer losses in
everything at once. The more likely outcome is that you will hold onto
your wealth in some of the places where you trade, even though you
suffer frequent losses. On the other hand, if you see that your profits
from trade are increasing greatly, buy good land with two thirds of it,
for money is usually secure in the form of land, whether it’s in your
own hands or in your kinsmen’s hands. Do as you like with the remaining
third—leave it in trading, or put it all into land if you want. But if
you decide to keep your money invested in trade, you yourself should
stop going from land to land on trading voyages, as soon as you have
made enough money and have learnt as much as you want about foreign
customs….</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li>Seas are not all the same size. Small seas present few dangers and
may be navigated without risk at any time of the year, for it’s only a
question of being able to predict favorable winds for a day or two, and
that’s not difficult for men who understand weather. Also, there are
many lands which offer numerous harbors when the coast is reached. So,
if men can wait for fair winds in a good harbor, or can be confident of
good harbors once the crossing has been made, or if the sea is so small
that there is no need to anticipate conditions for more than a day or
two, then they may risk crossing such a sea almost at will. But where
the sailor meets more difficulties—whether because the sea is broad and
full of currents, or because he has set his course for lands where the
harbors are dangerous owing to skerries, breakers, shoals, or
sandbanks—then he should always exercise great caution and avoid
crossing such seas late in the sailing-season.</li>
</ol>
<p>You asked about suitable times for sailing. I am strongly of the view
that it is not really safe to risk crossing the sea after the beginning
of October, because after that the seas become very rough and storms
grow wilder and wilder as autumn advances and winter comes closer….</p>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li>At the beginning of April it is possible to cross all but the widest
seas without risk, for about the middle of March, the days grow longer,
the sun is higher in the sky, and the nights become shorter….</li>
</ol>
