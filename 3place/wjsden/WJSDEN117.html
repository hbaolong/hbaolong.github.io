<h4 id="a-a-horse-fight-from-njals-saga-aaaaaaaa">(a) A Horse-fight from
Njal’s Saga AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 146–51.</p>
<ol start="57" type="1">
<li><p>There was a man called Starkad who farmed at Thrihyrning. He was
a married man, and his wife’s name was Hallbera. Their sons were
Thorgeir, Bork, and Thorkel. Their daughter was Hildigun the Healer. The
sons were arrogant, violent, quarrelsome men who rode roughshod over the
rights of others….</p></li>
<li><p>…Starkad had a fine, red stallion; he and his sons thought there
was no horse that could get the better of it in a fight. On one
occasion, Starkad’s nephews were at Thrihyrning. They chatted for a
while about the various farmers in Fljotshlid and, at length, they got
to wondering whether anyone would compete with them in a horsefight.
Some men who wished to flatter them said that not only would no one dare
to take them on, but nobody had a horse to equal Starkad’s.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“I know a man who would dare take you on,” responded Hildigun.</p>
<p>“Name him,” they said.</p>
<p>“Gunnar from Hlitharend has a brown stallion,” said Hildigun, “and
he’ll give you or anyone else a fight.”</p>
<p>“You women,” they replied. “You think there’s no one like Gunnar. But
just because Geir the Godi and Gizur the White were put to shame by him,
there’s no reason to think that we’ll do so badly.”</p>
<p>“You’ll do much worse,” she said.</p>
<p>Her words led to a fierce argument.</p>
<p>“Gunnar is the last man I’d want you to antagonize,” said Starkad,
“because you won’t find it easy to counter his good luck.”</p>
<p>“You will let us challenge him to a horsefight, won’t you?” they
asked.</p>
<p>“I will,” replied Starkad, “as long as you play fair with him.”</p>
<p>They said that they would.</p>
<p>Then the men from Thrihyrning rode to Hlitharend. Gunnar was at home
and came out to meet them, along with his brothers, Kolskegg and Hjort.
They gave the visitors a warm welcome and asked where they were
going.</p>
<p>“This far and no further,” they replied. “We have been told that you
have a fine stallion, and we want to challenge you to a horsefight.”</p>
<p>“You can’t have heard much about my horse,” answered Gunnar. “He is
young and completely untested.”</p>
<p>“But surely you’ll give him the chance to fight,” they said.
“Hildigun said that you’d welcome the idea of a horsefight.”</p>
<p>“Why were you talking about that?” asked Gunnar.</p>
<p>“Some men were saying that no one would dare pit his horse against
ours,” they answered.</p>
<p>“I would dare,” said Gunnar, “but I think that was a malicious
remark.”</p>
<p>“Shall we agree on the fight then?” they said.</p>
<p>“An agreement will give some point to your journey,” replied Gunnar.
“However, I want to make it a condition that we fight our horses to
provide sport for others, not trouble for ourselves, and that you won’t
treat me dishonorably. But if you treat me as you treat others, you can
be sure that I’ll get back at you in ways you’ll find hard to bear. I’ll
give you as good as I get.”</p>
<p>The men from Thrihyrning rode back home. When Starkad asked them how
their journey had gone, they replied that Gunnar had made their trip
worthwhile.</p>
<p>“He promised to give us a horse fight, and we settled where and when
it should take place,” they said. “But it was plain that he felt at a
disadvantage and was trying to get out of it.”</p>
<p>“Gunnar is usually reluctant to get into quarrels,” said Hildigun,
“but he’s hard to control if he can’t avoid them….”</p>
<ol start="59" type="1">
<li>…Crowds of people rode to the horsefight. Gunnar, his brothers, and
the Sigfussons were there. Njal and his sons were there. Starkad and
Egil, his brother-in-law, came with all their sons. They suggested to
Gunnar that it was time to bring the horses together, and he
agreed.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Gunnar, my kinsman,” said Skarphedin Njalsson, “do you want me to
goad your horse forward in the fight?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t” said Gunnar.</p>
<p>“It would be better if I did the goading,” said Skarphedin. “for then
there would be quick-tempered men on both sides.”</p>
<p>“You lot wouldn’t have to say or do much before trouble started,”
said Gunnar. “With me, the trouble will brew more slowly, though it will
all come to the same thing in the end.”</p>
<p>The horses were brought out. As Gunnar got ready to goad his horse,
Skarphedin led the animal forward. Gunnar was wearing a red tunic and a
broad silver belt. He carried a prod in his hand. Then the horses
attacked one another and bit at each other for a long time. They didn’t
even have to be goaded. It was splendid sport.</p>
<p>After a while, Starkad’s son, Thorgeir, and Kol Egilsson, his nephew,
came up with a plan. They decided that, as soon as the animals attacked
one another, they would push their horse forward and try to knock Gunnar
over. The horses attacked again. Thorgeir and Kol got behind their horse
and pushed, but Gunnar pushed back with his horse and, in an instant,
Thorgeir and Kol fell flat on their backs with their horse on top of
them. They leapt back up and ran at Gunnar. He jumped out of their way,
grabbed hold of Kol, and threw him to the ground with such force that he
was knocked out. Thorgeir then struck Gunnar’s horse so hard that its
eye flew out, and Gunnar hit Thorgeir with his prod, knocking him
senseless.</p>
<p>Gunnar walked over to his horse and said to his brother, Kolskegg,
“Kill the horse. He’s not going to live his life maimed like that.”</p>
<p>Kolskegg beheaded the horse. Then Thorgeir got to his feet and seized
his weapons. He wanted to attack Gunnar, but a great throng of people
came crowding around, and he was thwarted.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand all this pushing and shoving,” Skarphedin said. “Brave
men should fight with weapons.”</p>
<p>Gunnar stood by so quietly that it took only one man to hold him; he
said nothing at all to stir things up. Njal suggested coming to terms or
making a truce, but Thorgeir declared that he would neither give nor
accept a truce and would rather see Gunnar dead because of the blow.</p>
<p>“Gunnar has always stood firm in the face of threats,” said Kolskegg,
“and he won’t cave in now.” Then everyone rode home from the
horsefight….</p>
