<h4 id="c-egil-fights-a-berserk">(c) Egil Fights a Berserk</h4>
<p>Fighting berserks comes to be expected of saga-heroes. Here, Egil
obliges. In the sagas, the berserks are often seen as thugs and bullies
rather than as members of a warrior class. They are little more than
social nuisances.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar,
ed. Sigurður Nordal, Íslenzk fornrit II (Reykjavík, 1933),
pp. 201–6.</p>
<ol start="64" type="1">
<li>…All evening, Egil was very cheerful but Frithgeir and his household
were a bit subdued. Egil saw an attractive, well-dressed girl there and
was told that she was Frithgeir’s sister. The young woman was miserable
and cried incessantly all evening. Egil and his men thought this was
really odd.</li>
</ol>
<p>They stayed there overnight. Next morning the wind was so strong that
putting to sea was out of the question. Moreover, to leave the island,
they needed a ship. Both Frithgeir and Gytha, his mother, went to Egil
and invited him to stay there with his men until the weather was
favorable for sailing. They also offered to give him whatever transport
and provisions he needed for the journey. Egil accepted the offer and he
and his men stayed there, weather bound, for three nights. They were
treated very hospitably.</p>
<p>Then the weather improved, so Egil and his men got up early in the
morning and prepared to leave. They gathered their things together, and
then sat down to have something to eat and ale to drink. After the meal,
Egil rose and thanked Frithgeir and Gytha for their hospitality. Then
everyone went outside.</p>
<p>The farmer and his mother came to see them on their way. Then Gytha
began a whispered conversation with her son, Frithgeir. While Egil stood
waiting for them, he spoke to the young woman.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying, my girl?” he asked. “I have never seen you
looking happy.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t answer, and cried all the more. Frithgeir said to his
mother in a loud voice, “I’m not going to ask them to do this now that
they’re ready for their journey.”</p>
<p>So, Gytha went over to Egil and said, “I’ll tell you what’s happening
here, Egil. There’s a man called Ljot the Pale, a berserk and a duelist,
whom everyone dislikes. He came here and asked to marry my daughter, but
we gave him short shrift and turned down his offer. So he challenged my
son, Frithgeir, to a duel and tomorrow he’s coming to fight him on
Valdero island. Egil, I’d like you to go to the duel with Frithgeir. If
my brother, Arinbjorn [a close friend of Egil], were here in Norway, we
certainly wouldn’t have to put up with bullying from the likes of
Ljot.”</p>
<p>“Lady,” said Egil, “for Arinbjorn’s sake, I’m duty bound to go with
your son, if he thinks I can help at all.”</p>
<p>“You’re doing a fine thing, Egil,” she replied. “Let’s go back inside
and spend the day together.” Egil and his men went into the living room
and sat there drinking all day. In the evening, they were joined by some
of Frithgeir’s friends who had volunteered to go with him. The house was
crowded that night and there was a splendid feast.</p>
<p>Next morning, Frithgeir got ready for the journey. With him, he had
Egil and a large crowd of men. The weather was perfect for sailing, so
they went on their way and got to Valdero island. Close by the sea,
there was a pleasant field where the duel was to take place. The dueling
ground itself was marked out by stones which were laid around it. Now
Ljot arrived with his men and prepared for the duel. He was a huge,
strong-looking man, armed with a sword and shield. As he advanced
through the field to the dueling ground, he went into a berserk’s rage,
uttering terrible howls, and biting his shield. Frithgeir was a small,
slender man, handsome but not strong, and he had no experience of
fighting. When Egil saw Ljot, he recited this poem:</p>
<p>We shall go to the island, warriors,</p>
<p>defend the maiden from this man;</p>
<p>Frithgeir must not fight,</p>
<p>battle against the shield-biter</p>
<p>who gives offerings to the old gods,</p>
<p>battle against the storm-fierce fighter,</p>
<p>who rolls his eyes unnervingly</p>
<p>and is doomed to death.</p>
<p>Ljot saw Egil standing there and heard his words. “If you’re so keen
to fight me, big man,” said Ljot, “come on over to the field and we’ll
put one another to the test. It will be much fairer than fighting
Frithgeir, for my self-esteem won’t be improved even if I send him to
his grave.”</p>
<p>Then Egil recited:</p>
<p>It’s wrong to reject</p>
<p>Ljot’s little request;</p>
<p>I’ll swing my sword against</p>
<p>the wan-faced warrior;</p>
<p>ready for the fierce fight,</p>
<p>I’ll mete out no mercy;</p>
<p>here in Møre, warlike man,</p>
<p>you and the skald will skirmish.</p>
<p>Then Egil got ready for the duel with Ljot. He was carrying the
shield he always used; at his waist he was wearing the sword called
Adder, and in his hand he held Dragvandil [Slicer, a sword given to Egil
by Arinbjorn]. When Egil entered the dueling ground, Ljot was not yet
ready, so Egil brandished his sword and recited this poem:</p>
<p>Let cutting swords clash,</p>
<p>let steel strike shield,</p>
<p>and test its toughness;</p>
<p>let’s bathe swords in blood;</p>
<p>we’ll dock Ljot’s life,</p>
<p>play harshly with the pale one,</p>
<p>silence the bold warrior with our weapons,</p>
<p>let the eagle feed on his flesh.</p>
<p>Then Ljot stepped forward into the dueling ground and they attacked
one another. Egil slashed at Ljot, who parried with his shield, but
Egil’s blows came so fast that Ljot couldn’t get in a return blow. He
drew back to give himself room to strike, but Egil stayed right with
him, delivering blows ferociously until Ljot fled beyond the marker
stones and ran far into the field. That is how the first round went.
Then Ljot asked for a break, and Egil acquiesced. So they stopped and,
while they rested, Egil recited:</p>
<p>Greedy for gain, Ljot,</p>
<p>the scatterer of sword’s fire,</p>
<p>the hapless hero</p>
<p>falls back in fear;</p>
<p>bloodied, he balks at battle,</p>
<p>fails to stand firm,</p>
<p>flees far afield from</p>
<p>the bald-headed bard.</p>
<p>According to the rules of dueling in those days, when one man
challenged another, the challenger would receive whatever was in dispute
as the prize of victory if he won. But, if he lost, he had to pay an
agreed amount as ransom. If he died in the duel, he forfeited all his
property and the man who had killed him inherited it. It was also the
law that if a foreigner died without heirs in the country, his
inheritance went into the king’s treasury.</p>
<p>Egil told Ljot to get ready. “Let’s fight this duel to a finish,” he
said. Then, Egil ran at Ljot, struck him, and pressed up so close to him
that he fell back, and his shield slipped to the side. Immediately, Egil
struck Ljot just above the knee and cut off his leg. Ljot fell down dead
on the spot. Egil went over to Frithgeir and the others and they thanked
him profusely for what he had done. Then Egil recited:</p>
<p>The skald severed Ljot’s leg;</p>
<p>the doer of evil deeds died,</p>
<p>fell to feed wolves.</p>
<p>The poet gave Frithgeir peace;</p>
<p>I sought for myself</p>
<p>no gold-giver’s gift,</p>
<p>but fought the pale-faced foe</p>
<p>for the noisy sport with spears.</p>
<p>Few people lamented Ljot’s death for he had been a very violent man.
His family was Swedish and he had no relatives in Norway, but he had
gone there and made a fortune from dueling. He had killed many good
farmers after challenging them for their farms and ancestral lands. This
had made him exceptionally rich both in land and money.</p>
<p>After the duel, Egil went home with Frithgeir and stayed with him for
a short time before going south to Møre. Frithgeir and Egil parted on
the friendliest terms; Egil commissioned Frithgeir to claim the land
that had been owned by Ljot. Then he went on his way and arrived in
Fjordane.</p>
