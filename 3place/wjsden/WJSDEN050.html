<ol type="1">
<li>Hrolf Kraki and Skofnung</li>
</ol>
<p>Hrolf Kraki belonged to the Danish Scylding dynasty. He was nephew of
King Hrothgar in whose hall Beowulf killed the monster Grendel. This
passage from The Saga of Hrolf Kraki recounts Hrolf’s last battle and
his burial with his sword, Skofnung.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Hrólfs saga kraka, in
Fornaldarsögur Norðurlanda, ed. Guðni Jónsson, 4 vols. (Reykjavík,
1959), vol. 1, pp. 98–105.</p>
<ol start="50" type="1">
<li>King Hrolf leapt up from the high seat after he and his champions
had been drinking for a while. They left their good drink and went
outside at once, all except Bothvar Bjarki. No one saw him and they
wondered about his absence; they thought that he had probably been
captured or killed somewhere else.</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as they got outside, a dreadful battle broke out. King Hrolf
himself rushed forward with the standards and on either side of him were
his champions; the entire garrison was there but, though they were
numerous, they contributed little to the battle. Terrible blows could be
seen there, striking helmets and mail-shirts. Many swords and spears
could be seen in the air, and there were so many dead that they covered
the entire battlefield.</p>
<p>Brave-hearted Hjalti spoke: “Though many a mail-shirt has been
shredded, many a weapon broken, many a helmet shattered, and many a
brave horseman has been thrust from the saddle, our king is in great
spirits, for he is just as happy now as when he was drinking his fill of
ale. He always attacks with both hands, and he is very different from
other kings in battle, for it seems to me he fights with the strength of
twelve kings and kills many brave men. Now King Hjorvard [a legendary
Danish king] can see that Skofnung bites, and that it clangs against
their skulls, for it is Skofnung’s nature to sing aloud whenever it
tastes bone.”</p>
<p>The battle grew so hot that nothing could stand against King Hrolf
and his champions. It was wonderful to see how King Hrolf wielded
Skofnung; they wrought such havoc on King Hjorvard’s army that his
soldiers fell in heaps….</p>
<ol start="52" type="1">
<li>King Hrolf defended himself as a warrior should and his bravery was
incomparably greater than the courage of other men. The best troops of
Skuld [wife of Hjorvard] and King Hjorvard surrounded the king and
pressed him hard. Skuld now arrived at the battle and eagerly urged her
ruffians to attack King Hrolf, for she saw that his champions were not
near him. Bothvar Bjarki was enraged because he could not help his lord,
and the other champions shared Bjarki’s rage since they were now as
eager to die with their king as they had been to live with him in the
flower of their youth. By this time, King Hrolf’s entire retinue had
fallen—not one was left on his feet—and most of the champions had been
fatally wounded, as was only to be expected.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now such a great storm was brought about by spells that the champions
began to fall one on top of the other. Hrolf himself was outside the
shieldwall, almost dead from exhaustion. There is no need to prolong the
story: King Hrolf and all his champions died there with great glory. A
burial mound was built for King Hrolf, and the sword Skofnung was laid
beside him. A mound was also raised for each of the champions, and each
had his weapons beside him. Here ends the saga of King Hrolf Kraki and
his Champions.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Skeggi and Skofnung</li>
</ol>
<p>The Book of Settlements (Landnámabók) is an account of the settlement
of Iceland in the ninth and tenth centuries (see doc. 72b).</p>
<p>Source: Landnamabók, ed. Jakob Benediktsson, Íslenzk fornrit I
(Reykjavík, 1986), p. 212.</p>
<p>S. 174. In Norway, there was a distinguished man called Skeggi from
Skautad. His son was called Bjorn, nicknamed Bjorn the Skin because he
had traveled to Novgorod in Russia [as a fur trader]. When he grew tired
of trading journeys, he went to Iceland and settled Midfjord and
Linakradal. His son was Skeggi from Midfjord, a brave man and a
traveler, who fought in Russia. When he returned from the east, he went
to Saeland in Denmark where he broke into the burial mound of Hrolf
Kraki and stole Skofnung, King Hrolf’s sword, as well as Hjalti’s ax,
and many other treasures, but he didn’t find Laufi, the sword of Bothvar
Bjarki.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Kormak and Skofnung</li>
</ol>
<p>In Kormak’s Saga, Kormak, an Icelandic poet, attempts to use Skofnung
in a duel. The passage illustrates the magical properties of the
sword.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Kormak’s Saga, in Vatnsdoela
saga, ed. Einar Ól. Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit VIII (Reykjavík, 1939),
pp. 234–42.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>…Kormak told his mother, Dalla, how he had got on. “Our luck’s not
going to improve much, the way your life’s going,” she said. “You’ve
turned down an excellent match and you don’t stand a chance in a fight
against Bersi, for he’s a brave man with fine weapons.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Bersi’s sword was called Hviting, a sharp sword with a healing stone
in the hilt; he had carried it in many life-threatening fights. “Where
will you find weapons to use against Hviting?” asked Dalla.</p>
<p>Kormak answered that he would have a big, sharp ax. Dalla suggested
that he should visit Skeggi of Midfjord and ask him for the loan of his
sword, Skofnung. So Kormak went to Reykir, and explained his predicament
to Skeggi. He asked him to lend Skofnung, but Skeggi was reluctant,
saying that Kormak and Skofnung had entirely different temperaments.</p>
<p>“Skofnung is slow and deliberate whereas you are rash and impatient,”
said Skeggi. Kormak rode away; he wasn’t very pleased. When he got home
to Mel, he told his mother that Skeggi would not lend the sword. Now,
Skeggi looked after Dalla’s business affairs and there was a warm
friendship between them.</p>
<p>“He will lend the sword,” said Dalla, “though he may not give in
quickly.”</p>
<p>“It’s not fair if he’ll lend the sword to you, but not to me,” said
Kormak.</p>
<p>Dalla said that her son was an ill-tempered man. Some days later,
Dalla told Kormak to go to Reykir. “Skeggi will lend you the sword now,”
she said. So Kormak went to see Skeggi and asked for Skofnung.</p>
<p>“You’ll find the sword difficult to handle,” said Skeggi. “There’s a
pouch attached to it, and you must leave that alone. The sun mustn’t
shine on the pommel, and you must never carry the sword unless you’re
getting ready for a fight. When you get to the scene of the fight, wait
until you are sitting alone before drawing the sword; then hold the
blade out in front of you, blow on it and a little serpent will wriggle
out from under the pommel; then turn the sword over to allow the serpent
to wriggle back under the pommel.”</p>
<p>“You sorcerers put on quite a show,” said Kormak. “Nonetheless,” said
Skeggi, “everything must be done just so.”</p>
<p>After this, Kormak rode home and told his mother how he had got on,
remarking that her wishes carried great weight with Skeggi. He showed
her the sword and tried to draw it, but it wouldn’t come out of the
scabbard. “You’re too headstrong, my son,” said Dalla. Then Kormak put
his feet on the hilt of the sword and tore off the pouch. Skofnung
howled, but stayed in the sheath.</p>
<p>Time passed and the appointed day arrived. Kormak rode from home with
fifteen men, and Bersi, too, rode to the island with an equal number of
men. Kormak arrived first and told Thorgils that he wanted to sit on his
own. Then he sat down and took off the sword. However, he made no effort
to keep the pommel out of the sunlight, and had actually been wearing it
outside his clothes. He tried to draw the sword but wasn’t able to until
he stood on the hilt. The little serpent came out, but it wasn’t handled
properly. So, the spell was broken, and the sword came from the sheath
groaning.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>After that, Kormak rejoined his companions. By then, Bersi and his
men had arrived, and many others had come to watch the fight. Kormak
picked up Bersi’s shield and hacked at it so that sparks flew. A cloak
was now spread on the ground for them to stand on.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Kormak, you have challenged me to a formal duel, but I’m offering
you single combat instead,” said Bersi. “You are a young and
inexperienced man, and duels are a complicated business, but single
combat is straightforward.”</p>
<p>“Fighting in single combat won’t be any better,” said Kormak. “I’ll
take my chances and consider myself your equal in everything.” “Just as
you like,” said Bersi.</p>
<p>The laws of dueling required that the cloak laid on the ground should
be five ells square and have loops at each corner. Pegs with heads at
one end should then be driven into each loop: these pegs are called
tjosnur. Whoever sets this up must approach the pegs in such a way that
he can see the sky between his legs and he must hold the lobes of his
ears while saying the prayer used later in the sacrifice called the
tjosnur sacrifice. Three squares, each a foot wide, must be measured
around the cloak and, at the outer edges of these squares, there must be
four poles, called hazels. When these steps are complete, the field is
called a “hazeled field.”</p>
<p>Each man was to have three shields and when all three were destroyed,
he was to get onto the cloak, even if he had been driven from it before,
and from then on he was to defend himself there using his weapons alone.
The one who had been challenged was to strike the first blow and if
either was wounded so that blood fell on the cloak, there was no
obligation to go on fighting. If a man stepped outside the hazel poles
with one foot, he was said to be “falling back on his heel,” but if both
feet went outside, he was said to be “running.” Each of the two fighters
was to have a companion to hold his shield in front of him, and the man
who was the more seriously wounded was to pay a dueling ransom of three
marks of silver.</p>
<p>Thorgils carried the shield in front of his brother, Kormak, and
Thord Arndisarson did the same for Bersi. Bersi struck the first blow
and split Kormak’s shield. Kormak struck back just as aggressively. Each
wrecked the other’s three shields. Then it was Kormak’s turn to strike
and he swung at Bersi who warded off the blow with Hviting. Skofnung
broke the point from Hviting right where the gutter-ridge ended. The
sword-point flew onto Kormak’s hand, wounding his thumb. The joint was
cut open and blood dropped onto the cloak. After that the men were
separated and prevented from fighting on. “This is a shabby victory that
Bersi has won,” said Kormak. “He owes it to my bad luck, and yet we have
to part now.”</p>
<p>Kormak threw Skofnung down and it hit Bersi’s shield. Sparks were
struck from the shield and a notch was gouged from Skofnung. Bersi asked
for the dueling-ransom and Kormak replied that it would be paid. With
that, they parted.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>…After that, Kormak went home to Mel and visited his mother. She
healed his hand; the wound became ugly and the flesh swelled up around
it. They tried to smooth the notch in Skofnung, but the more they tried,
the larger it grew. Then he went back to Reykir and threw the sword at
Skeggi’s feet and recited this verse:</li>
</ol>
<p>I bring back to you,</p>
<p>Skeggi, this sword</p>
<p>broken-edged, blunt-toothed;</p>
<p>truly, their might outdid mine;</p>
<p>no fault falls to me</p>
<p>who fought fiercely</p>
<p>for the girl guarded</p>
<p>by the singing of swords.</p>

<li>Thorkel Eyolfsson and Skofnung</li>
</ol>
<p>Thorkel reaps the benefits of Skofnung’s magic properties. From The
Saga of the People of Laxdale.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 170–74, 221–22.</p>
<ol start="57" type="1">
<li>…At that time, there was a man named Thorkel Eyolfsson who was
involved in trading voyages. He was a well-known man of noble family and
a great friend of Snorri Godi. When he was in Iceland, he always stayed
with his kinsman, Thorstein Kuggason.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once, when Thorkel had a ship laid up at Vail on Bard strand, the son
of Eid of As was killed in Borgarfjord by the sons of Helga of Kropp.
Grim was the man who did the killing along with his brother, Njal. Njal
drowned in the Hvita [White River] shortly afterwards and Grim, who was
condemned to outlawry for the killing, hid out in the hills after he was
outlawed. Grim was a big, strong man when all this happened, but Eid was
very old and that is why the case was not followed up vigorously.
However, people were very critical of Thorkel Eyjolfsson for not
pursuing the case.</p>
<p>In the spring, after he had fitted out his ship, Thorkel traveled
south across Breidafjord. There, he got himself a horse and rode alone
without stopping until he reached the home of his relative Eid at As;
Eid gave him a warm welcome. Thorkel explained that he intended to find
the outlaw, Grim, and asked Eid if he had any idea where Grim’s hideout
was.</p>
<p>“I don’t like this one bit,” replied Eid. “I think you’re risking a
great deal taking on a devil like Grim. But, if you’re determined to go,
take plenty of men with you, so that you’ll have the upper hand.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s much glory in taking a whole body of men
against a single man,” said Thorkel. “I’d like you to lend me the sword
Skofnung and then I’m sure I’ll be able to deal with a lone outlaw, no
matter how resourceful he is.”</p>
<p>“Have it your own way,” said Eid. “It won’t surprise me, though, if
you come to regret your willfulness. But, since you seem to think you’re
doing this for my sake, I won’t refuse your request, for I’m sure that
Skofnung will be in good hands when it’s with you. However, Skofnung has
special properties because of which the sun must never shine on the
hilt, and it must never be drawn when there are women present. Also, if
someone is wounded by the sword, the wound won’t heal unless it’s rubbed
by the healing stone that is mounted on the sword.”</p>
<p>Thorkel said that he would be careful to bear all these instructions
in mind. Then he took up the sword and asked Eid to show him the way to
Grim’s hideout. Eid thought that Grim had a den in the north at Tvidag
[Two-Day Heath] near Fiskivatn [Fish Lake]. So Thorkel rode north across
the heath, following Eid’s directions, and when he had traveled quite a
distance into the heath, he saw a shed near a large lake and headed
toward it.</p>
<ol start="58" type="1">
<li>Thorkel approached the shed and saw a man with a cloak over his head
fishing at the mouth of a stream which flowed into the lake. He
dismounted, tethered his horse by the wall of the shed, and walked over
to the lake where the man was sitting. Grim saw Thorkel’s reflection in
the water and leapt up quickly, but by then Thorkel had got very close
to Grim and struck him. The blow caught Grim on the arm just above the
wrist, but the wound was not serious. So right away, Grim ran at Thorkel
and they started wrestling. The difference in strength told immediately
and Thorkel fell with Grim on top of him. Grim then asked him who he
was, but Thorkel replied that it didn’t matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Things haven’t gone quite as you intended,” said Grim, “for your
life is in my hands now.” Thorkel answered that he would not ask for
mercy. “It’s just my bad luck,” he said.</p>
<p>Grim replied that he had enough problems already without looking for
more.</p>
<p>“Your fate lies elsewhere; you’re not going to die here in a fight
with me, for I’m going to give you your life, and you can repay me
however you like.”</p>
<p>They both got up and walked back to the shed. Thorkel noticed that
Grim was becoming weak from loss of blood so he rubbed Grim’s wound with
Skofnung’s healing stone and then tied it to his arm. Immediately, the
stone removed all the pain and swelling from the wound. They stayed
there overnight; in the morning Thorkel got ready to leave and asked
Grim if he wanted to come with him. Grim said yes.</p>
<p>[The story of Skofnung and Thorkell is resumed after a considerable
absence from the saga.]</p>
<ol start="76" type="1">
<li>Early in the morning of Maundy Thursday [Thursday before Easter],
Thorkel got ready for his journey, but Thorstein tried his best to
dissuade him. “The weather looks unsettled,” he said. Thorkel replied
that the weather would suit him just fine. “You’re not going to stop me,
kinsman,” said Thorkel, “because I want to get home for Easter.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Thorkel launched the ferry and loaded it with timber, but Thorstein
unloaded the cargo just as quickly as Thorkel and his crew got it
aboard. “Give it up, Thorstein,” said Thorkel. “Stop trying to delay our
journey; you won’t get your way this time.”</p>
<p>“Then,” said Thorstein, “the person least suited to make the decision
will get his way, and this journey will have terrible consequences.”
Thorkel and his crew sailed along Breidafjord all that day; there were
ten men aboard. The weather blew up a gale which became a major storm
before letting up again, but being very brave men they pressed on
regardless. Thorkel had Skofnung with him in a chest. They sailed on
until they came to Bjarnarey [Bjorn’s Island]—people were watching them
from both shores—but when they got to the island, a squall caught the
sail and capsized the ship. Thorkel and all the men with him were
drowned, and the cargo of timber was driven far and wide among the
islands. Skofnung, which had got stuck in the ribs of the ship, came
ashore at Skofnung’s Island.</p>

<li>…Thorkel’s son Gellir lived at Helgafell until his old age and many
remarkable stories are told about him. He appears in many sagas though
he is not much mentioned in this one. He built a fine church at
Helgafell, which Arnor Jarlaskald [earls’ poet] describes in detail in
the mourning poem he wrote about Gellir.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Gellir was in late old age, he left Iceland on a journey. First,
he went to Norway. He didn’t stay there long, but left almost
immediately and traveled south to Rome to visit the holy apostle, Peter.
This was a lengthy trip, but eventually he traveled north to Denmark
where he fell ill and was confined to his bed for a long time. He
received the last rites and afterwards he died; now he lies buried in
Roskilde. Gellir had the sword Skofnung with him and it has never been
seen since. It had been taken from the burial mound of Hrolf Kraki in
