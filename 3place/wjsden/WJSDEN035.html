<h4 id="a-the-betrothal-of-olaf-hoskuldsson-aaaaaaaa">(a) The Betrothal
of Olaf Hoskuldsson AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Though marriage negotiations were generally carried on by fathers,
the sagas suggest that daughters often had some say in the decision. For
example, in The Saga of the People of Laxdale, Egil Skallagrimsson
consults his daughter about her betrothal to Olaf Peacock, who is
Hoskuld’s illegitimate son by an Irish slave-woman (see doc. 5).</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 62–65.</p>
<ol start="22" type="1">
<li>…Olaf spent the winter in Iceland and, in the spring, he and his
father discussed his prospects. “Olaf,” said Hoskuld, “I want you to
make a good marriage and take over your foster-father’s farm at
Goddastead. There’s still a lot of property there, and you can manage
the place with my help.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“I haven’t given it much thought before this,” answered Olaf, “and I
don’t know where there’s a woman who would bring me much luck in
marriage. You can be sure that I’ll set my sights high when I look
around for a wife. But, for certain, you wouldn’t have brought up the
topic without knowing where it would come down.”</p>
<p>“You’ve got that right,” said Hoskuld. “There’s a man called Egil
Skallagrimsson living at Borg in Borgarfjord. He’s got a daughter called
Thorgerd; she’s the best bet in Borgarfjord, or further afield for that
matter, and I’m going to ask for her hand in marriage for you. Another
benefit is that your position will be strengthened by having the men of
Myrar as your relatives.”</p>
<p>“I’ll trust your foresight about this,” replied Olaf, “for this
marriage will please me well enough, if it comes off. But you can be
sure of this, father, if this business begins and then gets nowhere,
I’ll be really displeased.”</p>
<p>“We can count on bringing it off,” said Hoskuld. Olaf told him to
decide for himself. The time for the meeting of the Althing [annual
judicial and legislative national assembly] was drawing near, so Hoskuld
got ready to leave with a large group of people, his son Olaf among
them. When they arrived at the assembly, they covered their booth
against the weather. The meeting was crowded and Egil Skallagrimsson was
there. Everyone who saw Olaf was talking about what a handsome and
distinguished man he was. He was well provided with weapons and
clothes.</p>
<ol start="23" type="1">
<li>One day, Hoskuld and Olaf left their booth to pay a visit to Egil
Skallagrimsson. Egil gave them a warm welcome as he and Hoskuld were old
acquaintances. Hoskuld opened the courtship on behalf of Olaf and asked
for Thorgerd as his son’s wife. She herself was at the Althing. Egil was
delighted by the offer, saying that he had heard good things about the
father and son.</li>
</ol>
<p>“I know, Hoskuld,” said Egil, “that you are of an excellent family
and very worthy in your own right, and Olaf’s journey [to Ireland] has
made him famous. It’s only natural that men like you should aim high,
and Olaf has both family and good looks. But now this has to be
discussed with Thorgerd, because she’s not going to fall into any man’s
hands unless she wants to.”</p>
<p>“Then I want you to discuss this with your daughter, Egil,” said
Hoskuld. Egil agreed and went to have a talk with Thorgerd.</p>
<p>He said, “There’s a man called Olaf—he’s the son of Hoskuld and he’s
very well-known. His father has brought up the question of marriage on
his son’s behalf, and has asked for your hand. I’ve put the whole
business completely in your hands, and I want your answer now; I think
an approach like this deserves a favorable response, because it’s an
excellent match.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard you say that you love me best of your children,” answered
Thorgerd. “But now I think that you weren’t telling the truth, if you
want to give me to a slave-woman’s son, even if he is good-looking and
dressy.”</p>
<p>“You aren’t as well-informed about him as you are about other
things,” said Egil. “Haven’t you heard that his mother is the daughter
of Myrkjartan, king of Ireland? He is much better born on his mother’s
side than on his father’s, and even that would be a good enough match
for us.” But Thorgerd didn’t let herself be persuaded and they parted,
with rather different views on the subject.</p>
<p>Next day, Egil went to Hoskuld’s booth and Hoskuld gave him a
friendly welcome. They began talking together, and Hoskuld asked how the
courtship business had gone. Egil spoke unhappily about it and told him
how things developed. Hoskuld said that the business looked impossible,
“But I think you’ve behaved well.”</p>
<p>Olaf didn’t take part in the conversation, but when Egil left, he
asked how the marriage negotiations had gone. Hoskuld said that they
were going slowly on her side.</p>
<p>“Father,” said Olaf, “I told you I would be upset if I got an
embarrassing reply, and that’s just how it is. This was begun mostly on
your advice, but now I’m going to manage the courtship myself to make
sure that it doesn’t collapse here. It’s true what they say: ‘Wolves
make a hash of hunting for another.’ So now I’m going straight over to
Egil’s booth.”</p>
<p>Hoskuld told him to do as he pleased. Olaf got dressed in the scarlet
clothes given to him by King Harald [Greycloak], and he wore the gilded
helmet and sword which he had received from King Myrkjartan. Now Hoskuld
and Olaf went to Egil’s booth, with Hoskuld in the lead and Olaf right
behind him. Egil gave them a warm welcome. Hoskuld sat down beside Egil,
but Olaf remained standing, looking about him. He saw a woman sitting on
the bench at the end of the booth. She was beautiful, distinguished in
appearance, and well-dressed. Olaf was sure that she must be Thorgerd,
the daughter of Egil, so he walked over to the bench and sat down next
to her. She greeted him and asked him who he was. Olaf gave his own name
and his father’s. “You must think it’s bold of a slave-woman’s son to
dare sit beside you,” said Olaf.</p>
<p>“And you must be thinking,” she answered, “that you’ve done things
you consider braver than talking to a woman.” Then they fell into
conversation with one another. They talked for the whole day, but no one
could hear what they were talking about. Before they ended their
conversation, Hoskuld and Egil were called over to them, and discussion
of Olaf’s offer of marriage began afresh, for Thorgerd had come around
to her father’s way of thinking. The negotiations were quickly
concluded, and they were betrothed on the spot. Out of respect for the
family at Laxdale, the bride was to be brought to their home, and not
the other way around. They announced that the wedding would take place
at Hoskuldstead after the seventh week of summer.</p>

<li>How Unn Mordsdaughter Found Herself Betrothed</li>
</ol>
<p>In this passage from Njal’s Saga, betrothal is treated as a matter of
business by Hoskuld and Unn’s father, Mord. Unn is not consulted, and
her prospective husband leaves the Althing (the Icelandic national
assembly) apparently without talking to her.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 7–9.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>On one occasion, the brothers Hoskuld and Hrut rode to a crowded
meeting of the Althing. Hoskuld said, “Brother, I want you to improve
your way of life and look for a woman to marry.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“That’s been on my mind for a while,” replied Hrut, “but there have
always been two ways of looking at it. But I’ll do whatever you think I
should. Where are we going to look?”</p>
<p>Hoskuld replied, “There are plenty of chiefs here at the Thing, and
you have plenty of choice. But I’ve settled on one particular place
where you can make your offer. There’s a woman called Unn, she’s the
daughter of Mord Fiddle, and you can take a look at her if you
like.”</p>
<p>Next day, as people were making their way to the law court, the
brothers saw some well-dressed women outside the booths of the men from
the Rang river valley. Hoskuld said to Hrut, “There’s Unn now, the one I
was talking to you about. How does she look to you?”</p>
<p>“She looks fine,” said Hrut, “but I don’t know if we’ll get on well
together.”</p>
<p>So they went on to the law court where Mord Fiddle was discussing
legal business as usual and when he finished, he returned to his booth.
Hoskuld and Hrut got up, went over to Mord’s booth, and entered. Mord
was sitting on the innermost seat of the booth, and when Hoskuld and
Hrut addressed him, he stood up to meet them. He took Hoskuld’s hand and
placed him in the seat next to his own, while Hrut sat next to Hoskuld.
They discussed various matters before they got down to Hoskuld’s
business.</p>
<p>“I want to talk business with you,” said Hoskuld. “Hrut wants to be
your son-in-law, and pay the price for your daughter. I’ll do all I can
to make sure the deal happens.”</p>
<p>“I know you’re an important chieftain,” answered Mord, “but I don’t
know a thing about your brother.”</p>
<p>“Hrut’s got more going for him than I have,” replied Hoskuld.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to pay out a lot for him because she’ll inherit
everything I have,” said Mord.</p>
<p>“You won’t have to wait long to hear what I’ll promise with him,”
answered Hoskuld. “He’ll have Kambsness and Hrutstead, and the land as
far up as Thrandargils. He also has a trading ship at sea.”</p>
<p>“Mord,” said Hrut, “my brother has given me far too much credit out
of his affection for me. Bearing that in mind, if you want to make an
agreement, I want you to decide the terms of the deal.”</p>
<p>Mord replied, “I’ve considered the terms. She will have six hundreds
[of homespun cloth, used as a means of exchange] outright, and a third
of that in your house. If the pair of you have heirs, you and she will
have equal shares in the property.”</p>
<p>Hrut answered, “I accept these terms, and now we have to witness the
deal.”</p>
<p>Afterwards, they stood up and shook hands and Mord betrothed his
daughter Unn to Hrut. The wedding feast was to be held at Mord’s house
two weeks after midsummer. Then both parties rode away from the
Thing….</p>
