<h4 id="king-olaf-tryggvason-builds-the-long-serpent-aaaaaaaa">32. King
Olaf Tryggvason Builds the Long Serpent AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>One of the most famous ships of the entire Viking Age is King Olaf
Tryggvason’s Long Serpent, constructed near Nidaros/Trondheim, Norway,
in the winter of 999–1000. The Long Serpent was probably about 40 meters
in length, belonging to the class of vessels known as drekkar or dragon.
The Long Serpent was King Olaf’s ship at the battle of Svold in
999/1000, where the most intense fighting of the entire battle took
place on the fore- and after-decks of this ship (see doc. 37a). From The
Saga of Olaf Tryggvason in Heimskringla.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Óláfs saga
Tryggvasonar, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 1, pp. 335–36.</p>
<ol start="88" type="1">
<li>During the winter after his return from Halogaland, King Olaf
Tryggvason built a ship at Hladhamar. This ship was bigger than any
other in the country and the stocks on which it was built survive as
visible proof of this. Thorberg the Woodcarver was responsible for the
stem and stern, but there were many others involved in the work as well.
Some of them felled trees; some shaped the wood; some forged nails; and
some hauled timber. All the materials used were of the best quality, and
the ship was constructed with large timbers. It was long and broad and
stood high above the water.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as the sides were being built, Thorberg had to go back to his
farm on pressing business. He stayed there for some time and when he
returned, the sides had reached their full height. That evening, the
king and Thorberg went out right away to see how work on the ship was
progressing, and everyone agreed that such a large and beautiful
longship had never been seen before.</p>
<p>Then the king returned to town, but, early next morning, he and
Thorberg went back to the ship again. The workmen had already arrived,
but they were all standing around doing nothing. When the king asked
them what the problem was, they replied that the ship had been
vandalized; someone had gone from stem to stern, cutting one deep notch
after another all down one side of the ship.</p>
<p>When the king drew near and saw the truth for himself, he swore that
the man who had damaged the ship so maliciously would die, if he could
be found. “There will be a substantial reward for anyone who can provide
me with information,” he said. Then Thorberg spoke up. “I can tell you
who did this, king,” he said.</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised,” replied the king, “that you’re the man who’s
lucky enough to find this out and tell me about it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you who did it, king,” repeated Thorberg. “I did it.”
“Then you’ll make it as good as new,” said King Olaf, “or pay for it
with your life.”</p>
<p>Thorberg went and shaved down all the planks to the same depth as his
ax-cuts. The king and everyone else agreed that the ship was much more
elegant on the shaved side, and King Olaf asked Thorberg to finish the
other side in the same way. Then he thanked Thorberg profusely and
appointed him head shipwright until construction was completed.</p>
<p>The ship was a warship built on the same lines as the Serpent, which
King Olaf had brought from Halogaland, but the new ship was much bigger
and more splendidly finished throughout. King Olaf named it the Long
Serpent and called the other one the Short Serpent.</p>
<p>The Long Serpent had thirty-four rooms, or rowers’ benches [giving a
total of sixty-eight oars]. The dragon’s head at the prow and the coiled
tail at the stern were both heavily gilded and the sides stood as high
above the water as those of ocean-going ships. The Long Serpent was the
best and most costly ship ever built in Norway.</p>
