<h4 id="christianity-in-sweden-aaaaaaaa">96. Christianity in Sweden
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Included in the fourth book of Adam of Bremen’s History of the
Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen is the following account of a Swedish
convert to Christianity and Christian missions to the Swedes.</p>
<p>Source: trans. F.J. Tschan, Adam of Bremen, History of the
Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, with new introduction by T. Reuter (New
York: Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 208–10.</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>In that country [Sweden] there took place lately an event worth
remembering and widely published because it was noteworthy, and it also
came to the archbishop’s attention. One of the priests who was wont to
serve the demons at Uppsala became blind and the help of the gods was of
no avail. But as the man wisely ascribed the calamity of blindness to
his worship of idols, by which superstitious veneration he had evidently
offended the almighty God of the Christians, behold, that very night a
most beautiful Virgin appeared to him and asked if he would believe in
her Son, if to recover his sight he would put aside the images he had
previously worshiped. Then he, who for the sake of this boon would
refuse to undergo nothing that was hard, gladly promised he would. To
this the Virgin answered: “Be completely assured that this place in
which so much innocent blood is now shed is very soon to be dedicated to
my honor. That there may not remain any trace of doubt in your mind
about this matter, receive the light of your eyes in the name of Christ,
who is my Son.” As soon as the priest recovered his sight, he believed
and, going to all the country about, easily persuaded the pagans of the
faith so that they believed in him who made the blind see.</li>
</ol>
<p>Impelled by these miracles, our metropolitan, forthwith obedient to
the saying that runs, “Look up, and lift up…with your eyes and see the
countries; for they are white already to harvest,” consecrated for those
parts the younger Adalward, whom he took from the choir at Bremen, a man
who shone in letters and for moral probity. Through legates of the most
illustrious King Stenkil he also fixed Adalward’s see in the city of
Sigtuna, which is a day’s journey distant from Uppsala. But the way is
such that, sailing the sea from Scania of the Danes, you will arrive at
Sigtuna or Björkö on the fifth day, for they are close together. If,
however, you go by land from Scania, through the midst of the Gothic
peoples and the cities Skara, Södertelege, and Björkö, it will take you
a month to reach Sigtuna.</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>Glowing with fervor, then, Adalward entered Sweden to preach the
Gospel and in a short time led to the Christian faith all in Sigtuna and
round about. He also secretly agreed with Egino, the most saintly bishop
of Scania, that they should go together to the pagan temple called
Uppsala to see if they could perhaps offer Christ some fruit of their
labors there, for they would willingly undergo every kind of torture for
the sake of destroying that house which was the seat of barbarous
superstition. For, if it were torn down, or preferably burned, the
conversion of the whole nation might follow. Observing that the people
murmured about this design of the confessors of God, the most pious king
Stenkil shrewdly kept them from such an undertaking, declaring that they
would at once be punished with death and he be driven from the kingdom
for bringing malefactors into the country, and that everyone who now
believed would quickly relapse into paganism, as they could see had
lately been the case in Slavia. The bishops deferred to these arguments
of the king and going through all the cities of the Goths, they broke up
idols and thereafter won many thousands of pagans to Christianity. When
Adalward later died in our midst, the archbishop appointed in his place
a certain Tadico of Ramelsloh, who out of love for his belly preferred
even to starve at home rather than be an apostle abroad. Let these
remarks about Sweden and its rites suffice.</li>
