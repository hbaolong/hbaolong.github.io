Description of the Islands of the North AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Adam of Bremen’s History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen is a
history of the diocese and its archbishops, written ca 1072–75/76 and
revised down to the early 1080s, when Adam probably died. The
archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were charged with the conversion of the
neighboring peoples of the north, including the inhabitants of
Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Source: Adam of Bremen, trans. F.J. Tschan, History of the
Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, with new introduction by T. Reuter (New
York: Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 186–223.</p>
<p>Here, if you please, the fourth book will begin.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The country of the Danes, as one also reads in the Gesta of Saint
Ansgar, is almost all spread out over islands. Now, this Danish land is
separated from our Nordalbingians by the river Eider, which rises in the
densely wooded highland of the pagans, called Isarnho, which they say,
extends along the Barbarian Ocean as far as the Schlei Sea. The Eider
flows into the Frisian Ocean, which the Romans in their writings call
the British Ocean. The principal part of Denmark, called Jutland,
extends lengthwise from the Eider River toward the north; it is a
journey of three days if you turn aside in the direction of the island
of Fyn. But if you measure the distance direct from Schleswig to
Aalborg, it is a matter of five to seven days’ travel. That is the
highway of the Caesar Otto unto the farthermost sea at Wendila, which
sea is to this day called the Ottinsand from the king’s victory [Otto II
campaigned against Denmark in 974]. At the Eider Jutland is fairly wide,
but thereafter it narrows little by little like a tongue to the point
called Wendila, where Jutland comes to an end. Thence it is a very short
passage to Norway. The soil in Jutland is sterile; except for places
close to a river, nearly everything looks like a desert. It is a salt
land and a vast wilderness. Furthermore, if Germany as a whole is
frightful for its densely wooded highlands, Jutland itself is more
frightful in other respects. The land is avoided because of the scarcity
of crops, and the sea because it is infested by pirates. Hardly a
cultivated spot is to be found anywhere, scarcely a place fit for human
habitation. But wherever there is an arm of the sea it has very large
cities. This region the Caesar Otto at one time subjected to tribute and
divided into three bishoprics. One he established at Schleswig, which
also is called Haddeby and is situated on the arm of the Barbarian Sea
named by the inhabitants the Schlei, whence also the city derives its
name. From this port ships usually proceed to Slavia or to Sweden or to
Samland, even to Greece. The second bishopric he founded at Ribe, a city
encompassed by another waterway that flows in from the ocean and over
which one sails for Frisia, for England or for our Saxony. The third
bishopric he planned to fix at Aarhus, separated from Fyn by a very
narrow channel that reaches in from the Eastern Sea and extends in a
long winding course between Fyn and Jutland northward up to this city of
Aarhus. Then one sails to Fyn or Zealand, or Scania, or even to
Norway….</p></li>
<li><p>Now the archbishop consecrated from among his own clerics Rudolf
for Schleswig, Wilhelm for Zealand, Egilbert for Fyn. The latter, a
convert from piracy, is said to have been the first to find the island
Helgoland, which lies hidden in a deep recess of the ocean in the mouth
of the Elbe River, and, having built a monastery there, to have made it
habitable. This island lies across from Hadeln. It is barely eight miles
long by four miles wide, and its people use straw and the wreckage of
ships for fuel. Report has it that whenever pirates plunder there, be
the booty ever so slight, they never return home unpunished, either
perishing soon after in shipwreck or getting killed by someone. For this
reason they are accustomed with great devotion to offer the hermits who
live there tithes of their booty. This island produces crops in the
greatest abundance and is an exceedingly rich foster mother for birds
and cattle. On it there is but one hill and not a single tree. It is
hemmed in on all sides by very precipitous crags that prohibit access
except in one place, where also the water is sweet. All sailors hold the
place in awe, especially, however, pirates. Hence it got the name by
which it is called, Heiligland [Holy Land, now Helgoland]. From the Vita
of Saint Willebrord we learned that it was called Fosetisland and that
it is situated on the boundary between the Danes and Frisians. There
also are many other islands off Frisia and Denmark, but none of them is
so noteworthy.</p></li>
<li><p>Fyn is a fairly important island, lying back of that called
Wendila in the entrance of the Barbarian Gulf [Baltic Sea]. It is close
to the region named Jutland, from every part of which the passage to Fyn
is very short. There is the great city of Odense. Small islands encircle
it, all abounding in crops. And it is to be observed that if you pass
through Jutland into Fyn, your route is a straight way to the north. But
your course faces east in going through Fyn into Zealand. There are two
passages to Zealand, one from Fyn, the other from Aarhus; each place is
an equal distance from Zealand. The sea is naturally tempestuous and
full of two kinds of danger so that, even if you have a fair wind, you
can hardly escape the hands of pirates.</p></li>
<li><p>Zealand is an island, very large in extent, situated in an inner
bight of the Baltic Sea. It is very celebrated as much for the bravery
of its men as for the abundance of its crops. It is two days’ journey in
length and almost the same in breadth. Its largest city is Roeskilde,
the seat of Danish royalty. This island, equally distant from Fyn and
from Scania, may be crossed in a night. To the west of it lies Jutland,
with the cities of Aarhus and Aalborg, and Wendila; to the north, where
it is also a desert, is the Norwegian strait; to the south, the
aforementioned Fyn and the Slavic Gulf. On the east it faces the
headlands of Scania, where is situated the city of Lund.</p></li>
<li><p>There is very much gold in Zealand, accumulated by the plundering
of pirates. These pirates, called Vikings by the people of Zealand, by
our people, Ascomanni, pay tribute to the Danish king for leave to
plunder the barbarians who live about this sea in great numbers. Hence
it also happens that the license granted them with respect to enemies is
frequently misused against their own people. So true is this that they
have no faith in one another, and as soon as one of them catches
another, he mercilessly sells him into slavery either to one of his
fellows or to a barbarian. In many other respects, indeed, both in their
laws and in their customs, do the Danes run contrary to what is fair and
good. None of these points appears to me worth discussing, unless it be
that they immediately sell women who have been violated and that men who
have been caught betraying his royal majesty or in some other crime
would rather be beheaded than flogged. No kind of punishment exists
among them other than the ax and servitude, and then it is glorious for
a man who is convicted to take his punishment joyfully. Tears and
plaints and other forms of compunction, by us regarded as wholesome, are
by the Danes so much abominated that one may weep neither over his sins
nor over his beloved dead.</p></li>
<li><p>From Zealand to Scania there are many routes; the shortest is
that to Helsingborg, which is even within the range of vision. Scania is
the province of Denmark fairest to look upon—whence also its name—well
provided with men, opulent of crops, rich in merchandise, and now full
of churches. Scania is twice as large as Zealand, that is it has three
hundred churches, whereas Zealand is said to have half that number, and
Fyn a third. Scania is the most remote part of Denmark, almost an
island, for it is surrounded on all sides by sea except for one reach of
land which, becoming mainland on the east, separates Sweden from
Denmark. The densely wooded highlands and very rugged mountains, over
which the road from Scania into Götaland necessarily runs, make one
doubt whether perils by land are more easily avoided than perils by sea,
and whether to prefer the former to the latter….</p></li>
<li><p>But now, since the subject provides the occasion, it seems
appropriate to say something about the nature of the Baltic Sea. Because
I drew upon the writings of Einhard when I previously mentioned this sea
in connection with the deeds of Archbishop Adaldag, I shall proceed in
the manner of a commentator, setting forth for our people in greater
detail what he discussed in abridged form. There is a gulf, Einhard
says, that stretches from the Western Ocean toward the east. This gulf
is by the inhabitants called the Baltic because, after the manner of a
baldric, it extends a long distance through the Scythian regions even to
Greece. It is also named the Barbarian Sea or Scythian Lake, from the
barbarous peoples whose lands it washes. But the Western Ocean
apparently is the one which the Romans in their writings called the
British Ocean. It is of immense breadth, terrible and dangerous, and on
the west encompasses Britain to which is now given the name England. On
the south it touches the Frisians and the part of Saxony that belongs to
our diocese of Hamburg. On the east there are the Danes and the mouth of
the Baltic Sea and the Norwegians, who live beyond Denmark. On the north
that ocean flows by the Orkney Islands and then encircles the earth in
boundless expanses. On the left there is Hibernia, the fatherland of the
Scots, which now is called Ireland. On the right there are the crags of
Norway, and farther on the islands of Iceland and Greenland. There ends
the ocean called dark [Arctic Ocean].</p></li>
<li><p>What Einhard says about the unexplored length of this gulf has
lately been proved by the enterprise of the highly spirited men, Ganuz
Wolf, a Danish leader, and Harold, the king of the Norwegians [Harald
Hardradi, d. 1066]. After exploring the compass of this sea with much
toilsome travel and many dangers to their associates, they finally came
back, broken and overcome by the redoubled blows of the winds and
pirates. But the Danes affirm that many have oftentimes explored the
length of this sea. With a favorable wind some have reached Ostrogard in
Russia from Denmark in the course of a month. As to its breadth, he
asserts that it is “nowhere more than a hundred miles…and in many places
much narrower.” This can be seen at the mouth of that sea, the entrance
of which from the ocean, between Aalborg or Wendila, the headland of
Denmark, and the cliffs of Norway is so narrow that it is an easy trip
of one night across by sail. Likewise, on leaving the bounds of Denmark,
the sea stretches wide its arms, which come together a second time in
the region of the Goths by the side of whom live the Wilzi. The farther
one goes, then, the farther do its coast lines spread apart.</p></li>
<li><p>Many peoples, Einhard says, occupy the shores of this sea. The
Danes and the Swedes, whom we call Northmen, hold both its northern
shore and all the islands off it. The Slavs, the Esths, and various
other peoples inhabit the eastern shore; amongst them the Welatabi, also
called Wilzi, are the most important. The Danes and the Swedes and the
other peoples beyond Denmark are all called Northmen by the historians
of the Franks, although the Roman writers named men of this kind
Hyperboreans, whom Martianus Capella extolled with many
commendations.</p></li>
<li><p>At the mouth of the sea mentioned before, on its southern coast
facing us, there live as far as the Schlei Sea the first people, the
Danes, who are called Jutes. There begins the territory of the diocese
of Hamburg, which extends a long way through the midst of the Slavic
coastal peoples as far as the Peene River. There are the limits of our
diocese. From that place to the Oder River the Wilzi and Leutici have
their homes. Across the Oder, as we have learned, live the Pomeranians;
beyond them stretches the very extensive country of the Poles, the
boundary of which, they say, joins with that of the kingdom of Russia.
This is the farthest and largest province of the Winuli, and it also is
at the end of that sea.</p></li>
<li><p>Returning now to the northernmost parts at the entrance of the
Baltic Sea, first come the Norwegians; then Scania, which belongs to the
Danes, juts out, and beyond it live the Goths in an extensive domain
reaching to Björkö. After that the Swedes rule over a spacious region
extending to the land of women [the Amazons]. Beyond them, as far as
Russia, are said to live the Wizzi, Mirri, Lami, Scuti, and Turci. In
this area that sea again comes to an end. Thus the Slavs possess the
southern litoral of that sea; the Swedes, the northern.</p></li>
<li><p>Those who have a knowledge of geography also assert that some men
have passed by an overland route from Sweden into Greece. But the
barbarous peoples who live between make this way difficult;
consequently, the risk is taken by ship.</p></li>
<li><p>In this sea [the Baltic Sea] there are many islands, all of which
are under the dominion of the Danes and Swedes, though a few are held by
the Slavs. Of these islands, at a short distance from one another, the
first is Wendila, at the head of this strait, the second is Morsö, the
third is Thyholm. The fourth, opposite the city of Aarhus, is Samsö. The
fifth is Fyn, the sixth is Zealand, which lies close to it. Of these
islands we have made mention before. They say that the seventh, which is
very near Scania and Götaland, is called Holm, the most celebrated port
of Denmark and a safe anchorage for the ships that are usually
dispatched to the barbarians and to Greece. There are, furthermore,
close to Fyn on the southeast—although Laaland reaches farther inwards
to the confines of the Slavs—seven other smaller islands, which we said
above are rich in crops, that is, Möen, Fehmarn, Falster, Laaland,
Langeland, and so all the others in their vicinity. These fourteen
islands belong to the kingdom of the Danes, and they all are
distinguished by the honor of being Christian. There also are other more
distant islands that are subject to the authority of the Swedes. Of
these islands the largest, the one called Courland, takes eight days to
traverse….</p></li>
<li><p>In going beyond the islands of the Danes there opens up another
world in the direction of Sweden and Norway, which are the two most
extensive kingdoms of the north and until now nearly unknown to our
parts. About these kingdoms the very well-informed king of the Danes
[Svein Estridson, 1047–76] told me that Norway can hardly be crossed in
the course of a month, and Sweden is not easily traversed in two months.
“I myself found this out,” he said, “when a while ago I fought for
twelve years in those regions under King James. Both these countries are
shut in by exceedingly high mountains—higher ones, however, in Norway
which encircles Sweden with its alps.” About Sweden, too, the ancient
writers, Lolinus and Orosius, are not silent. They say that the Swedes
hold a very large part of Germany and, besides, that their highland
regions extend up to the Rhiphaean Mountains. There, also, is the Elbe
River to which Lucan appears to have referred. It rises in the alps
before mentioned and courses through the midst of the Gothic peoples
into the ocean; hence, also, it is called the Götaälv. The Swedish
country is extremely fertile; the land is rich in fruits and honey
besides excelling all others in cattle raising, exceedingly happy in
streams and woods, the whole region everywhere full of merchandise from
foreign parts. Thus you may say the Swedes are lacking in none of the
riches, except the pride that we love or rather adore. For they regard
as nothing every means of vainglory; that is gold, silver, stately
chargers, beaver and marten pelts, which make us lose our minds admiring
them….</p></li>
<li><p>There are many Swedish peoples excelling in strength and arms,
besides being the best of fighters on horse as well as on ships. This
also accounts for their holding the other peoples of the North in their
power. They have kings of ancient lineage; nevertheless, the power of
these kings depends upon the will of the people, for what all in common
approve, that the king must confirm, unless it be that his decision,
which they sometimes reluctantly follow, seems preferable. And so they
enjoy equality at home. When they go to war everyone yields perfect
obedience to the king or to the one who, more skilled than the rest, is
preferred by the king. Whenever in fighting they are placed in a
critical situation, they invoke the aid of one of the multitude of gods
they worship. Then after the victory they are devoted to him and set him
above the others. By common consent, however, they now declare that the
God of the Christians is the most powerful of all. Other gods often fail
them, but he always stands by, a surest “helper in due time in
tribulation” [Ps. 9:10].</p></li>
<li><p>Of these Swedish peoples, the so-called Goths live nearest to us;
there are other Goths known as eastern. Västergötland, indeed, borders
on the Danish territory called Scania, from which they also say it takes
seven days to reach Skara, the great city of the Goths. Thence
Östergötland extends along the sea, the one they call the Baltic, up to
Björkö….</p></li>
<li><p>Between Norway and Sweden dwell the Wärmilani and Finns and
others, who are now all Christians and belong to the Church of Skara. On
the confines of the Swedes and Norwegians toward the north live the
Skritefingi [Sámi], who, they say, outstrip wild beasts at running.
Their largest city is Hälsingland…there are besides countless other
Swedish peoples, of whom we have learned that only the Goths, the
Wärmilani, and a part of the Skritefingi, and those in their vicinity,
have been converted to Christianity.</p></li>
<li><p>Let us now proceed to give a brief description of Sueonia or
Sweden. On the west, Sweden has the Goths and the city of Skara; on the
north, the Wärmilani with the Skritefingi, whose chief city is
Hälsingland; on the south, the length of the Baltic Sea, about which we
have spoken before. There is the great city of Sigtuna. On the east,
Sweden touches the Rhiphaean Mountains, where there is immense
wasteland, the deepest snows, and where hordes of human monsters prevent
access to what lies beyond. There are Amazons, and Cynocephali, and
Cyclops who have one eye on their foreheads; there are those Solinus
calls Himantopodes, who hop on one foot, and those who delight in human
flesh as food, and as they are shunned, so may they also rightfully be
passed over in silence. The king of the Danes, often to be remembered,
told me that a certain people were in the habit of descending from the
highlands into the plains. They are small of stature but hardly matched
by the Swedes in strength and agility. “Whence they come is not known.
They come up unexpectedly,” he said, “sometimes once in the course of a
year or after a three-year period. Unless they are resisted with all
one’s might, they lay waste the whole region and then withdraw.” Many
other things are usually mentioned, but in my effort to be brief I have
not mentioned them, letting those speak about them who declare they
themselves have seen them. Now we shall say a few words about the
superstitions of the Swedes….</p></li>
<li><p>As Nortmannia is the farthest country of the world, so we
properly place consideration of it in the last part of the book. By
moderns it is called Norway. Of its location and extent we made some
mention earlier in connection with Sweden, but this in particular must
now be said, that in its length that land extends into the farthest
northern zone, whence also it takes its name. It begins with towering
crags at the sea commonly called the Baltic; then with its main ridge
bent toward the north after following the course of the shore line of a
raging ocean, it finally has its bounds in the Rhiphaean Mountains,
where the tired world also comes to an end. On account of the roughness
of its mountains and the immoderate cold, Norway is the most
unproductive of all countries, suited only for herds. They browse their
cattle, like the Arabs, far off in the solitudes. In this way do the
people make a living from their livestock by using the milk of the
flocks or herds for food and the wool for clothing. Consequently, there
are produced very valiant fighters who, not softened by an
overindulgence in fruits, more often attack others than others trouble
them. Even though they are sometimes assailed—not with impunity—by the
Danes, who are just as poor, the Norwegians live in terms of amity with
their neighbors, the Swedes. Poverty has forced them thus to go all over
the world and from piratical raids they bring home in great abundance
the riches of the lands. In this way they bear up under the
unfruitfulness of their own country. Since accepting Christianity,
however, imbued with better teachings, they have already learned to love
the truth and peace and to be content with their poverty—indeed, to
disperse what they had gathered, not as before to gather what had been
dispersed….</p></li>
<li><p>In many places in Norway and Sweden cattle herdsmen are even men
of the highest station, living in the manner of patriarchs and by the
work of their own hands. All, indeed, who live in Norway are thoroughly
Christian, except those who are removed beyond the arctic tract along
the ocean. These people, it is said, are to this day so superior in the
magic arts or incantations that they profess to know what every one is
doing the world over. Then they also draw great sea monsters to shore
with a powerful mumbling of words and do much else of which one reads in
the Scriptures about magicians. All this is easy for them through
practice. I have heard that women grow beards in the extremely rough
alps of that region and that the men live in the woods, rarely exposing
themselves to sight. They use the pelts of wild beasts for clothing and
in speaking to one another are said to gnash their teeth rather than to
utter words, so that they can hardly be understood by the peoples
nearest to them. That mountain region is named by Roman writers the
Rhiphaean range, terrible for its perpetual snows. Without these frosty
snows the Skritefingi cannot live and in their course over the deepest
drifts they fly even faster than the wild beasts. In those same
mountains there are such large numbers of big game that the greatest
part of the country subsists only on the beasts of the forest. Aurochs,
buffalo, and elk are taken there as in Sweden. Bison, furthermore, are
caught in Slavia and Russia. Only in Norway, however, are there black
fox and hares, white martens and bears of the same color who live under
water like aurochs. And since much else may there be seen that is
entirely different and strange to our people, we leave it and other
things to be more fully described by the inhabitants of that
land.</p></li>
<li><p>The metropolitan city of the Norwegians is Trondheim, which, now
graced with churches, is frequented by a great multitude of peoples. In
that city reposes the body of the most blessed Olaf, king and martyr
[Olaf Haraldsson, d. 1030]. At this tomb the Lord to this very day works
such very great miraculous cures that those who do not despair of being
able to get help through the merits of the saint flock together there
from far-off lands. But the route is of a kind that, boarding a ship,
they may, in a day’s journey, cross the sea from Aalborg or Wendila of
the Danes to Viken, a city of the Norwegians. Sailing thence toward the
left along the coast of Norway, the city called Trondheim is reached on
the fifth day. But it is possible also to go another way that leads over
a land road from Scania of the Danes to Trondheim. This route, however,
is slower in the mountainous country, and travelers avoid it because it
is dangerous….</p></li>
<li><p>Beyond Norway, which is the farthermost northern country, you
will find no human habitation, nothing but ocean, terrible to look upon
and limitless, encircling the whole world. The ocean off Norway contains
many considerable islands, of which nearly all are now subject to the
rule of the Norwegians and so are not to be overlooked by us because
they also belong to the diocese of Hamburg. The first of them are the
Orkney Islands, which the barbarians call the Organae. Like the
Cyclades, they are strewn over the ocean. The Roman writers Martian and
Solinus, it appears, wrote about them thus: “Back of Britain, where the
boundless ocean begins, are the Orkney Islands, of which twenty are
deserted, sixteen are inhabited. The Orkney Islands, numbering nearly
forty, lie close together. In their vicinity, too, are the Electrides
[the Hebrides?], on which amber originates.” Situated between Norway and
Britain and Ireland, the Orkneys, therefore, laugh playfully at the
threats of a menacing ocean. It is said that one can sail to them in a
day from the Norwegian city of Trondheim. They say, too, that from the
Orkneys it is just as far whether you steer toward England or set sail
for Scotland. For these same Orkney Islands, although they had
previously been ruled by English and Scottish bishops, our primate on
the pope’s order consecrated Throlf bishop for the city of Birsay, and
he was to have the cure of all….</p></li>

<p>[There follow descriptions of Iceland, Greenland, Helgeland, and
Vinland.]</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li><p>Archbishop Adalbert of blessed memory likewise told us that in
the days of his predecessor certain noble men of Frisia spread sail to
the north for the purpose of ranging through the sea, because the
inhabitants claimed that by a direct course toward the north from the
mouth of the Weser River one meets with no land but only that sea called
the Libersee. The partners pledged themselves under oath to look into
this novel claim and, with a joyful call to the oarsmen, set out from
the Frisian coast. Then, leaving on the one side Denmark, on the other
Britain, they came to the Orkneys. And when they had left these islands
to their left, while they had Norway on their right, the navigators
landed after a long passage on icy Iceland. And as they furrowed the
seas from that place toward the farthest northern pole, after they saw
behind them all the islands spoken about above, they commended their way
and venture to Almighty God and the holy confessor Willehad. Of a sudden
they fell into the numbing ocean’s dark mist which could hardly be
penetrated with the eyes. And behold, the current of the fluctuating
ocean whirled back to its mysterious fountainhead and with most furious
impetuosity drew the unhappy sailors, who in their despair now thought
only of death, on to chaos; this they say is the abysmal chasm—that deep
in which report has it all the back flow of the sea, which appears to
decrease, is absorbed and in turn revomited, as the mounting fluctuation
is usually described. As the partners were imploring the mercy of God to
receive their souls, the backward thrust of the sea carried away some of
their ships, but its forward ejection threw the rest far behind the
others. Freed thus by the timely help of God from the instant peril they
had had before their eyes, they seconded the flood by rowing with all
their might.</p></li>
<li><p>No sooner had the mariners escaped the peril of darkness and the
land of frost than they unexpectedly came upon an island [possibly
Ireland] fortified like a town by very high cliffs which encircled it.
When they disembarked there to explore the place, they found men lurking
in underground hollows at midday. Before the entrances lay a countless
number of vessels of gold and of metals of a kind considered rare and
precious by mortals. When they had taken as much of the treasure as they
could carry away, the happy oarsmen returned quickly to their ships. Of
a sudden they saw coming behind them the amazingly tall men whom our
people call Cyclops. Before them ran dogs exceeding the usual size of
these quadrupeds, who in their attack seized one of the comrades and in
a twinkling tore him to pieces before their eyes. The rest, however,
took to the ships and escaped the peril. The giants, as they said,
followed them, with vociferations, almost out to the high sea. Attended
by such good fortune, the Frisians came back to Bremen where they told
Archbishop Alebrand everything as it had happened and made offerings to
the blessed Christ and his holy confessor Willehad for their safe
return….</p></li>
<li><p>This is what we have learned about the nature of the northern
regions in order to set it down to the honor of the Church at
Hamburg….</p></li>

<p>Scandinavian Society</p>
<p>While textual material from the Viking Age is scarce, the corpus of
later medieval Icelandic literature provides an invaluable source of
information on Scandinavian society and its socio-political
organization. These sources must be used with care, however. They are
rooted in oral tradition, and it is difficult to know to what extent the
saga literature is an accurate reflection of the Viking Age, and to what
extent it reflects the society of the age in which it was written—mostly
the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.</p>

<li>The Lay of Rig (RígsÞula)</li>
</ol>
<p>The incomplete Eddic poem known as Rígsþula, The Lay of Rig, relates
the mythical origins of the different social orders. Though preserved in
a thirteenth-century manuscript, the poem is considerably older. The
brief prose introduction to the poem identifies Rig as the Norse god
Heimdall, who is said, in Völuspá (see docs. 7 and 8), to be the father
of the human race. “Rig” is related to the Celtic word for king.</p>

ed. Gustav Neckel; 5th rev. edition, ed. Hans Kuhn (Heidelberg: Carl
Winter, 1983), pp. 280–87.</p>
<p>In old tales, men say that one of the Æsir [gods], Heimdall by name,
journeyed along a sea-coast, and that he came to a farmhouse, where he
went by the name of Rig. This poem tells the story.</p>
