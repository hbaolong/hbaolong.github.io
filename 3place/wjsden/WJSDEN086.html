<h4 id="the-rūs-attack-constantinople-aaaaaaaa">61. The Rūs Attack
Constantinople AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>In June of 860, while the emperor Michael III and the army were on
campaign against the Muslims, Constantinople was attacked by a Russian
fleet numbering two hundred vessels, according to Greek and Slavonic
sources. Photius (d. ca 895) was patriarch of Constantinople at the time
of the attack and spoke of it in two sermons. The first, quoted here,
was delivered in St. Sophia during the attack itself, in the second half
of June, and the second probably in early July, following the withdrawal
of the Rūs. Although Photius’s purpose was not to provide a chronicle or
narrative of the attack, but rather to draw moral and religious lessons,
his sermons, despite their rhetorical flourishes and moral invectives,
represent our best Greek source on the event and constitute important
historical evidence, coming as they do from a highly educated and
articulate eyewitness.</p>
<p>Source: trans. Cyril Mango, The Homilies of Photius Patriarch of
Constantinople (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1958),
pp. 82–84, 86–92.</p>
<p>Homily III of the Same Most-Blessed Photius, Archbishop of
Constantinople, First Homily on the Attack of the Russians.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What is this? What is this grievous and heavy blow and wrath? Why
has this dreadful bolt fallen on us out of the farthest north? What
clouds compacted of woes and condemnation have violently collided to
force out this irresistible lightning upon us? Why has this thick,
sudden hail-storm of barbarians burst forth, not one that hews down the
stalks of wheat and beats down the ears of corn, or lashes the
vine-twigs and dashes to pieces the unripe fruit, or strikes the stems
of plants and tears the branches apart (which for many has often been
the extent of its most grievous damage), but miserably grinding up men’s
very bodies, and bitterly destroying the whole nation? Why or how have
the lees (to call them no worse) of so many and great disasters been
poured out on us? Is it not for our sins that all these things have come
upon us? Are they not a condemnation and a public parading of our
transgressions? Does not the terror of things present indicate the awful
and inexorable judgment of the future? Is it not the apprehension of us
all, nay the sight before the eyes of each, that not one will have been
left any longer to survive, so that not even the fire-tender can escape
the calamity to tell the tale? Verily, sins diminish tribes, and sin is
like a two-edged sword for those who indulge in it. We were delivered
from evils which often had us held; we should have been thankful, but we
showed no gratitude. We were saved, and remained heedless; we were
protected, and were contemptuous. For these things punishment was to be
feared. O cruel and heedless minds, worthy to suffer every misfortune
and distress! From those who owed us small and trifling things we made
relentless exaction; we chastised them. We forgot to be grateful when
the benefit had gone by. Nor did we pity our neighbors because we had
been pardoned ourselves. But in being freed from the impending fears and
dangers, we became yet more cruel to them, and we neither considered the
number and magnitude of our own debts which the Savior had forgiven, nor
did we respect the debt of our fellow-servants, tiny as it was, and not
to be weighed against our own even in the measure of speech. Having been
ourselves mercifully delivered from many great debts, we unmercifully
enslaved others for little ones. We enjoyed ourselves, and grieved
others; we were glorified, and dishonored others; we grew strong and
throve, while waxing insolent and foolish. We became fat, gross and
thick, and although we do not forsake God as Jacob of old, yet like the
beloved one, we have been filled and we kicked, and like a maddened
heifer we raged against the Lord’s commandments, and we disdained his
ordinances. For this reason there is a sound of war and great
destruction in our land. For this reason the Lord hath opened his
treasury and brought forth the weapons of his anger. For this reason a
people has crept down from the north, as if it were attacking another
Jerusalem, and nations have been stirred up from the end of earth,
holding bow and spear; the people is fierce and has no mercy; its voice
is as the roaring sea. We have heard the report of them, or rather we
have beheld their massed aspect, and our hands have waxed feeble;
anguish has seized us, and pangs as a woman in travail….</li>
</ol>
<p>…I am far from enumerating all the thefts and robberies, the
fornications and adulteries, and all those other unspeakable deeds,
excellent and durable fuel for this fire that has been kindled and
poured around us. I know that now as you revolve these matters, you
mourn and look downcast. But time is pressing, the Judge incorruptible,
the danger terrible, the mass of sins great, and the repentance
insufficient. Often I have sown words of reproof, words of threat in
your ears, but, it seems, they grew up amidst thorns. I implored you, I
castigated you. Often have I pointed out to you the ashes of the
Sodomites, and the flood that went before, when the earth was covered
with the waters, and the universal destruction of the human race was
effected. Often have I represented the Jewish people, the chosen one,
the beloved one, the royal priesthood, for its murmuring, its
rebelliousness, its ingratitude, and similar trespasses, being lashed
and humbled by the foe it had defeated, and over whom it had itself
triumphed—diminished, falling, perishing. Often have I admonished you:
be on your guard, mend yourselves, convert yourselves; do not wait for
the sword to be furbished: the bow is being bent. Do not take God’s
long-suffering as an occasion for contempt; do not act wickedly in the
face of his extreme gentleness. But why do I irritate your hearts which
are already inflamed? Surely it is better to castigate you as you are
now sorrowing, than to send you away unreproached to suffer punishment
from above, and to use the present misfortune as a helper in convicting
you, rather than, respecting your plight, leave the disobedient and the
sinners unreproved. What now? We have admonished and threatened you,
using the name of God: our God is jealous and long-suffering, but when
he is angered, who shall withstand him?</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>These things have I been saying, but, it seems, it was like
carding wool into the fire—a proverb that is timely for me to quote now
(would it were not so!). For you have not been converted, nor have you
repented, but you have made your ears heavy so that you should not hear
the word of the Lord. For this reason his wrath has been poured upon us,
and he has kept watch over our sins, and he has set his face against us.
“Woe is me, that my sojourning has been too long,” will I cry out with
the psalmist David, short as it has been. It has been too long because I
have not been heard in my entreaties, because I see a cloud of
barbarians deluging with blood our city which has been parched by sins.
Woe is me that I have been preserved to see these evils, that we have
become a reproach to our neighbors, a scorn and derision to them that
are round about us, that the unbelievable course of the barbarians did
not give rumor time to announce it, so that some means of safety could
be devised, but the sight accompanied the report, and that despite the
distance, and the fact that the invaders were sundered off from us by so
many lands and kingdoms, by navigable rivers and harborless seas. Woe is
me, that I see a fierce and savage tribe fearlessly poured round the
city, ravaging the suburbs, destroying everything, ruining everything,
fields, houses, herds, beasts of burden, women, children, old men,
youths, thrusting their sword through everything, taking pity on
nothing, sparing nothing. The destruction is universal. Like a locust in
a cornfield, like mildew in a vineyard, or rather like a whirlwind, or a
typhoon, or a torrent, or I know not what to say, it fell upon our land
and has annihilated whole generations of inhabitants. I deem them happy
who have fallen prey to the murderous barbarian hand, because, having
died, they have avoided sooner the awareness of the calamities which
have seized us unexpectedly. If the departed had any consciousness of
these things, then they too would have bewailed with me those who are
still left behind for the things they are suffering continually, and
because they have taken their fill of so great pain without being
relieved of it, and seeking death they find it not. For it is much
preferable to die once than to expect continually to die, to be
constantly grieved by the sufferings of one’s neighbors, and to have
one’s soul lacerated.</p></li>
<li><p>Where is now the Christ-loving emperor? Where are the armies?
Where are the arms, the engines, the military deliberations and
preparations? Is it not an attack of other barbarians which has removed
and drawn to itself all these things? The emperor endures long labors
beyond the frontier, and the army has marched away to toil with him:
whilst we are worn down by the ruin and slaughter before our eyes, which
have overtaken some and are about to overtake others. As for this fierce
and barbarous Scythian tribe, having crawled out of the very outskirts
of the city, like a wild boar it has devoured all round about. Who then
will defend us? Who will array himself against the foe? We are deprived
of everything, we are helpless on all sides. What lament may equal our
misfortunes? What tears will be able to suffice for the magnitude of the
calamities that surround us? Come unto me, O most compassionate of
prophets, bewail Jerusalem with me—not the ancient one, the metropolis
of one nation, which grew up from a root with twelve offshoots, but the
metropolis of the entire universe, as much of it as is adorned by the
Christian creed, which lords it in antiquity, in beauty, size, splendor,
in the multitude and magnificence of its inhabitants. Bewail with me
this Jerusalem, not yet captured and fallen down, but standing nigh to
being captured, and rocked by the calamities we behold. Bewail with me
the queen of the cities, not as she is led away captive, but whose hopes
of salvation are in captivity. Seek water for the head and fountains of
tears for the eyes, pity her and mourn for her, since she weeps sore in
the night, and her tears are on her cheeks, and there is none to comfort
her; since Jerusalem has sinned a sin; therefore has she come into
tribulation and those who have been awed by her might have sneered at
her; since the Lord has sent fire into her bones, and has made heavy his
yoke on our neck, and has laid pains on our hands which we shall be
unable to withstand. Weep with me since mine eyes have failed with
tears, my belly is troubled, and my heart is turned within me for I am
embittered with much bitterness; abroad the sword has bereaved me; and
the enemy has opened his mouth against me, and gnashed his teeth, and
said: I shall swallow her up. O queenly city, what a throng of evils has
poured around thee, as the depths of the sea and the mouth of fire and
sword have cast lots according to barbarian custom for the children of
thy belly, yea, those settled so splendidly outside the town, and are
devouring them. O fair hope of many men, what a calamitous threat and
what a mass of horrors have inundated thee all round, and have humbled
thy celebrated glory! O city reigning over nearly the whole universe,
what an uncaptained army, equipped in servile fashion, is sneering at
thee as at a slave! O city adorned with the spoils of many nations, what
a nation has bethought itself of despoiling thee! O thou who hast
erected many trophies over enemies in Europe, Asia and Libya, see how a
barbarous and lowly hand has thrust its spear against thee, making bold
to bear in triumph victory over thee! Everything with thee has come to
such a pitch of misfortune, that thy unassailable strength has sunk to
the dregs of extreme infirmity, and thy enemies, beholding thy infirmity
and subjection, display the strength of their arm against thee, and try
to bedeck themselves with a glorious name. O queen of queenly cities,
who hast saved many others from dangers by thy alliance, who hast with
thy arms raised up many that had been forced down to their knees, now
lying a prey deprived of helpers! O grace and splendor, size and beauty,
elegance and adornment of venerable shrines, O sanctuary of bloodless
victims, place inviolate and holy of the dread sacrifice and the
mystical table, see how enemies’ feet are threatening defilement! O pure
veneration, stainless faith, undefiled worship, see how the mouth of the
impious and the arrogant is opened wide against us! O white hairs,
unction and ministry of the priests! O me, holy shrine of God and God’s
Wisdom, sleepless eye of the universe! Wail ye virgins, daughters of
Jerusalem. Weep ye young men of the city of Jerusalem. Mourn ye also,
mothers. Shed tears, ye babes, shed tears; for the magnitude of the
calamity forces even you to awareness. Shed tears, for our ills have
been multiplied, and there is none to deliver, none to help….</p></li>
