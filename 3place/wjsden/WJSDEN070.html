<h4 id="the-life-of-saint-findan">44. The Life of Saint Findan</h4>
<p>Findan was an Irishman from Leinster who was enslaved by Northmen
around the middle of the ninth century, perhaps in the 840s. En route to
Scandinavia, he managed to escape from his captors in the Orkney
Islands, where he was aided by some local Christians. After journeying
to the continent and making a pilgrimage to Rome, he became a monk at
the monastery of Rheinau in modern-day Switzerland around 851; he died
in the late 870s. Findan’s Life was written by a fellow Irish monk not
long after his death. The text belongs to a genre known as hagiography,
or the panegyric of a saint, written to demonstrate the sanctity of the
subject. A saint’s life is not identical either to biography or history
in the modern sense, although elements of both may be present. A simple
but effective characterization of the genre is simply “sacred
biography.” This obscure text deserves to be better known for the light
it sheds upon several aspects of the early Viking Age.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from “Vita Sancti Findani,”
ed. Oswald Holder-Egger, in Monumenta Germaniae Historica, ed. Heinrich
Pertz. Scriptores (in Folio) (SS), 15, 1 [Supplementa tomorum I-XII,
pars III. Supplementum tomi XIII], 502–6.</p>
<p>The Life of Saint Findan the Confessor</p>
<p>Those whom almighty God has predestined to eternal life, even before
the creation of the world, and while they are still in the toils of
worldly cares and pursuits, he leads, with unutterable mercy, to the
principles of the perfect life, and does so in many ways that flow from
the pure spring of his clemency. So, too, it seems appropriate for us to
set down in compendious language the praiseworthy record of a memorable
man whose life has been exemplary in our times and will prove beneficial
for us as we read and reread it, and will be of equal use and profit to
posterity.</p>
<p>With the Grace of God I shall tell how by happy adventures a man
called Findan, a Scot [Irishman] from Leinster, attained perfection of
life, despite frequent torments and temptations. Now, the sister of this
man was taken captive with other women by those foreigners called
Norsemen when they devastated far and wide in the Scottish island called
Ireland. Then, their father ordered his son, Findan, to ransom her and
bring her back to him. Burning to perform his father’s orders and
guarding his sister’s love in a faithful heart, he gathered companions
around him and set off with an interpreter. But, early on the journey,
he was captured by pagans, thrown into chains, and carried without delay
to their ships, which were moored at a beach nearby. All that day and
the following night he suffered in his fetters without food or
drink.</p>
<p>In the morning, the Norsemen held a council at which the more
sensible of them—inspired in their humanity by God, we believe—argued
that men who had come to ransom others ought not themselves to be held
by force. And this is how Findan was set free, for our blessed Lord
recognized that his servant, though still a layman, would serve him in
the future most devoutly in every way. So too, on another occasion, when
a crowd of the same enemies had chased him fleeing into a house, none of
them were able to find him hidden behind the door, though they searched
for him in every corner.</p>
<p>Nor, we think, should we be silent about the circumstances of his
undertaking a foreign journey or about the laudable manner in which he
attempted to conclude it. In the province of Leinster, serious
dissension arose between two chieftains. The father of the Findan who is
our subject was a soldier of one of the chieftains, and he killed a man
of the opposing party. The opposing chieftain, overcome with anger,
advanced on the home of Findan’s father accompanied by a large force,
with the intention of destroying the man and his possessions with fire
and sword. They arrived by night and placed an armed cordon around the
house. They set fire to the roof and murdered Findan’s father as he
emerged from the flames. Findan was lodged in another house, and they
started fires around him in the same way, but could not lay hands on
him, so valiant was his defence. With the protection of divine grace, he
eluded both the flames and his enemies with scarcely a wound. His
brother was in the same house, and they killed him. Not surprisingly,
this event caused fierce enmity and inexorable feuding between the
tribes.</p>
<p>Before long, however, through the intermediacy of some trustworthy
men, Findan and his people were given a large sum of money, and peace
was restored between the two sides. In the very same year, Findan’s
enemies began to fear that grief for his father would quicken again in
his heart and that he would take revenge on them. Equally, they wished
to do away with him and were hatching secret plots to this end. They put
their plan into action by preparing a seaside banquet for Findan. Findan
was invited, but Norsemen arrived in the middle of the feasting, by
prior agreement with his enemies, and seized him. They bound him tightly
and immediately made off with him. As was often the case, his Norse
lord, unwilling to return home yet, sold him on to another, who sold him
to a third, and the third to a fourth. This last wanted to see his
homeland again, so gathering his companions together, he led Findan and
some others into captivity.</p>
<p>When they had reached the mid-point of their sea-journey, the
Norsemen chanced to encounter another Norse fleet. One of these people
boarded the ship where Findan was a captive and started asking about the
nature of the island and how they had fared there. On board the ship,
however, was a man whose brother had been killed by the questioner, who
was no sooner recognized than killed. As soon as his companions saw
this, they got ready for battle, and the two ships engaged in a long,
bitter fight. While the struggle was raging, Findan, wishing to support
his master and his companions, got to his feet despite his shackles. The
crews of the other ships intervened and separated the combatants;
Findan’s ship backed out of danger.</p>
<p>Findan’s master was mindful of the loyalty Findan had shown despite
being in shackles. Wishing to reward such faithfulness, he immediately
released Findan from his chains. Findan showed promise of bringing
blessings to him in the future.</p>
<p>After that, they reached some islands called the Orcades [Orkney],
close to the Pictish race. They disembarked to refresh themselves. As
they awaited a favorable wind, they wandered here and there around the
islands. When Findan saw how free and easy his captors were, he began to
explore the island, wondering anxiously about how to get away safely. In
a lonely area, he found a huge rock and attempted to hide beneath it,
but the rising tide usually reached the rock, and Findan was at a loss
as to where he should go or what he should do. On one side the sea
threatened, and on the other fear of his enemies tormented him, as they
ran about the island and even walked on the rock where he was hidden,
calling his name from all sides. He preferred to endure the wild sea
rather than fall into the hands of men whose savagery outstripped that
of monstrous beasts. Though starving, he made light of the massive
waves, and remained in the same place all that day and the following
night. Next day, his enemies stayed in another part of the island and
the force of the sea diminished, no longer reaching the threshold of his
refuge, though sometimes, driven by the wind, it surged right into his
cave. So Findan arose, and, fearing the heathens, crept cautiously
through the scrub in search of an escape-route. He thought, too, that
the land around him had human inhabitants. Reaching the end of the
island, however, he discovered that on one side lay the vast sea while
the other side was indented by a shallow bay.</p>
<p>Robbed of his physical strength and overcome by the terrible weakness
brought on by imprisonment and hunger, Findan did not dare entrust
himself to the sea. With redoubled efforts he scoured the island for
three days on end, subsisting on herbs and water as he sought a way to
get off. And so he remained there until, on the third day, he saw sea
monsters and huge dolphins playing and diving close by the shore.
Overcome by divine mercy, he contemplated these creatures with an
untroubled mind and poured out these tearful prayers from the bottom of
his heart:</p>
<p>“God, creator both of these brute beasts and of me, a human being,
you gave them the sea as their element and to me you gave the earth on
which to set my feet. As is your merciful custom, help me in my present
troubles. From this moment, I dedicate my service to you in body and
soul, and I shall never think again of the enticements of this world. I
shall seek you in the dwellings of the apostles. I shall journey into
exile and never return to my homeland. From this moment, I shall serve
you with all my strength, and follow you without a backward glance.”</p>
<p>Fortified by this strong faith, he plunged fully dressed into the
sea. And what I shall relate now is miraculous! Instantly, divine mercy
made his clothing rigid so that its support kept him from sinking. It
seemed to him that his clothes swam and bore him safely to land through
the swollen waves. He climbed to the hilltops, looking for houses or
smoke rising from house roofs. For two days he lived on a scanty diet of
vegetation, but at dawn of the third day he saw people walking about in
the distance. Though he had no idea who they were, his heart leapt
within him, and he went up to them without hesitation. They welcomed him
and took him to the bishop of the neighboring community. This bishop had
studied his letters in Ireland and had a good knowledge of the language.
Findan stayed two years, receiving many kindnesses from this humane and
generous man….</p>
