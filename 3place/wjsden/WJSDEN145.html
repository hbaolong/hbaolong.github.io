<h4 id="the-battle-of-largs-1263">110. The Battle of Largs, 1263</h4>
<p>By the middle of the thirteenth century, both Scottish and Norwegian
monarchs were increasingly concerned with tightening their grip on the
Hebrides, the islands off the west coast of Scotland. These islands had
technically been under Norwegian control since 1098, but in practical
terms they were controlled by neither power, being ruled by autonomous
dynasties of sea-kings descended from Godred Crovan (d. 1095) and
Somerled (d. 1164), based in the Isle of Man and the Hebrides
respectively. Conflicts between and within these dynasties and the
disorder that they generated were, however, a cause of concern to
Scottish and Norwegian monarchs, who were both showing increased
interest in the Hebrides in the early thirteenth century. When reports
reached the Norwegian king, Hakon IV Hakonarson (1217–63), that the
Scots had attacked the Isle of Skye in the summer of 1262, he summoned a
massive levy at Bergen and set sail for the islands. His fleet,
described as the biggest that had ever sailed from Norway, cruised south
via Orkney and the Western Isles, but the expedition ended in disaster.
Caught in an autumnal gale on the night of 30 September/1 October off
the island of Arran, some of the Norwegian ships were blown ashore at
Largs, on the Ayrshire coast, and attacked by the Scots. The ensuing
skirmishes between the Norwegians and the Scots are known as the Battle
of Largs, and both sides claimed victory. Hakon died in the Orkneys in
December, en route back to Norway, and his successor, Magnus IV, ceded
the Western Isles to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266, ending
four centuries of Scandinavian influence there (although Orkney and
Shetland were not acquired by Scotland until 1469). The events of 1263
are significant for more than just the cession of the Western Isles to
Scotland, however. Hakon IV was one of the great medieval kings of
Norway. By the time of his death he had already subjugated Greenland and
Iceland. Culturally, he had made the Norwegian court comparable to other
European courts, and had Latin works translated into Old Norse. Some
scholars have, unsurprisingly, regarded his death as marking a
transition in Scandinavian history. From Hakon Hakonarson’s Saga by
Sturla Thordarson.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Icelandic Sagas and Other
Historical Documents Relating to the Settlements and Descents of the
Northmen of the British Isles. Vol. II, Hákonar Saga, with Fragment of
Magnus Saga, with Appendices, ed. G. Vigfusson (Rolls Series: London,
1887), pp. 327, 339–55.</p>
<ol start="314" type="1">
<li>The previous summer, letters had come from the king who ruled the
Hebrides. They complained bitterly about the unrest caused there by the
earl of Ross, and Karnak, son of Machamal, and other Scots who had
sailed out to Skye where they had burned down farms and churches, and
killed large numbers of men and women. They claimed, too, that the Scots
had seized little children and skewered them on the points of their
spears, and had shaken them until they slipped down onto their hands,
and then tossed them away dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>They also repeated the boasts of the king of Scots [Alexander III,
1241–86], and said that he definitely meant to bring the whole of the
Hebrides under his control, if he lived long enough. When this news
reached King Hakon, he was very concerned and consulted his friends and
advisers. But it didn’t matter what advice he got…after Yule he had
conscription notices distributed throughout Norway, calling for the
largest levies of men and supplies that he thought the country could
bear. He summoned the whole army to meet him early in the summer at
Bergen…. [Hakon then traveled to Scotland and through the Hebrides;
negotiations with the king of Scots were opened.]</p>
<ol start="322" type="1">
<li>…As a result of the discussions and peace negotiations carried on
between his representatives and those of the king of Scots, King Hakon
decided to send messengers to meet the king of Scots face to face….
[King Hakon’s envoys] met the king of Scots in the market town of New
Ayr. He received them civilly, but with no great warmth. When they
discussed peace, the king gave the impression that he would probably
come to terms, but said that he would make up his mind and then send
envoys to the king of Norway, with whatever offers seemed appropriate to
himself and his council.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that, King Hakon’s men went on their way, but it was another
day before the king of the Scots’ envoys reached King Hakon, and peace
talks began. King Hakon had made a list of all the islands off the west
of Scotland which he laid claim to, and the king of Scots named certain
islands that he was unwilling to give up, namely Bute, Arran, and the
Cumbraes. Other than that, there was very little separating the
positions of the two kings, and yet no peace agreement could be reached.
As a tactic, the Scots prolonged negotiations so as to avoid arriving at
any agreement at all, for the summer was almost over and weather
conditions were worsening. At this juncture, the envoys went back to the
king of Scots…. [Hakon decided to bring matters to a head and prepared
for battle, but a storm drove some of his ships ashore.]</p>
<ol start="325" type="1">
<li>When the Scots saw that Hakon’s ships were being driven ashore, they
rallied and charged down at the Norsemen, launching weapons at them. But
the Norsemen defended themselves, using the beached cog [a large cargo
ship] as protection. From time to time, the Scots attacked and just as
often they withdrew. Few men were killed there, but many were
wounded.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, King Hakon sent some troops ashore in boats, for the
storm was abating a bit. As this poem says:</p>
<p>The battle-blessed</p>
<p>spoiler of bright swords</p>
<p>sent his eager-minded men late</p>
<p>to the battle on the beach;</p>
<p>the prince’s people</p>
<p>brought down the boastful dale-dwellers, won</p>
<p>praise for their prince.</p>
<p>After that, the king, along with Thorlaug Bosi, went back out to his
ship in a small boat rowed by his personal attendants. As soon as King
Hakon’s troops came ashore, the Scots fled inland. The Norsemen stayed
ashore all evening and throughout the night until the approach of
daybreak. Then all the Norsemen went back to their ships.</p>
<p>At daybreak, the men aboard the king’s ship dressed and armed
themselves, and the men on the other ships did the same. Then they all
rowed ashore. The Scots had gone aboard the cog and taken all the
property they could lay their hands on. A little later, King Hakon came
ashore, with some of his nobles and a large body of men. The king had
the cog unloaded and had the cargo carried out to his ship by boat.</p>
<ol start="326" type="1">
<li>When the cog was almost empty, a large number of Scots appeared;
there were so many of them that most people thought the king himself
must be present. Ogmund Crow-Dance was on a hillock with a company of
men, and the first Scots on the scene made a feint at him and his men.
When King Hakon’s companions realized that the main Scottish force was
approaching, they begged him to get into a boat and row out to the
ships, and send them a much larger force. The king offered to stay
ashore with them, but they were reluctant to place him in such danger.
So, he boarded a boat and rowed out past the island to his fleet….</li>
</ol>
<p>[In the meantime, the battle developed ashore.]</p>
<p>There were nearly sixty men from the king’s ship, and their leader
was Andres Club-foot. But most people reckon that there must have been a
total of eight or nine hundred Norsemen ashore. Nearly two hundred of
them were on the hill with Ogmund while the rest were on the beach.</p>
<p>Then the Scottish army drew near, and it was a very large army
indeed. Some reckon that there must have been five hundred cavalrymen,
though others think that there were rather fewer than that. The Scottish
cavalry was very well equipped, with mail-clad horses and some Spanish
horses with armor. The Scots had a great many foot-soldiers, but they
were poorly armed. Most of them had bows and Irish axes.</p>
<p>The Norsemen on the hill began drifting down toward the sea to
prevent the Scots from encircling them. Andres Nikulasson went up the
hill and asked Ogmund if he didn’t think it would be wiser to go down to
the beach and join the force that was already there. Ogmund took that
advice. Andres told the men to go downhill, but not to rush as though
they were fleeing.</p>
<p>The Scots attacked them fiercely, pelting them with stones. Then a
great shower of weapons rained down on the Norsemen, and they withdrew,
defending themselves. As they reached the downward slope of the hill,
each man ran faster than the next. The Norsemen on the beach below saw
this, and thought that their companions were attempting to flee, so they
leapt aboard their boats. Some of them escaped to the ships this way,
but most of the boats sank, and several men died. Many of the Norsemen
took shelter behind the cog, while others got aboard her.</p>
<p>When the Norsemen coming down from the hill reached the valley
between the hill and the beach, most of them took to their heels. They
were ordered to turn back, and some did, but only a few…. The rest kept
running and when they reached the beach, they were again told to turn
back, and again some did, but not many…. This battle was both hard and
one-sided for there were ten Scots for every Norseman.</p>
<p>All during the battle, there was such a great storm that King Hakon
found it impossible to land his troops. However, Rognvald and Eilif from
Naustdal rowed toward the shore in small boats. Rognvald was swept back
out to his ship, but Eilif made it to land and joined the battle with
several other men. They fought very bravely as did those Norsemen who
had boarded boats and got to the beach. When the Norsemen began to
assemble their forces, the Scots withdrew up the hill and, for some
time, there were skirmishes between them, fought with spears and
stones.</p>
<p>Late in the day, the Norsemen launched an attack on the Scots who
were up on the hill, and pursued it with great vigor. As Hrafnsmál tells
us:</p>
<p>The chosen chieftains</p>
<p>of the master of North-Møre [Hakon]</p>
<p>sang war-songs</p>
<p>before mighty men;</p>
<p>the guards of the guardian</p>
<p>of the highseat, hooded</p>
<p>with iron advanced</p>
<p>to the battle of sword-blades.</p>
<p>The bright blade’s</p>
<p>edge bit in battle</p>
<p>the unworthy enemy</p>
<p>among curved red shields;</p>
<p>soon the Scottish</p>
<p>warriors fled the weapon</p>
<p>hail from the heroes</p>
<p>of our conquering king.</p>
<p>Then the Scots fled as fast as they could from the hill to the
mountains. When the Norsemen saw that, they returned to their boats and
rowed out to the ships. They had a hard time getting there because of
the storm….</p>
<p>On the following Thursday, the king weighed anchor and moved out past
the island. He was joined there by the troops he had sent to Loch Long.
On the Friday, the weather was fine, so the king sent the Guests [a
division of the royal bodyguard] to burn the ships which had been driven
ashore. The same day, the king sailed away from the Cumbraes out to
Lamlash, where he stayed for some days….</p>
<ol start="329" type="1">
<li>During the summer, the king had a great deal to worry him and many
sleepless nights. There were numerous calls upon him, and his men gave
him little peace. [When he came ashore at Kirkwall in the Orkneys,] he
fell ill and took to his bed immediately. To begin with, the illness was
not severe, and after the king had been laid up for about three weeks,
his condition took a turn for the better and stayed better for three
days. On the first day, he was able to get about his room; on the second
day, he went to the bishop’s chapel and heard mass there; and on the
third day, he walked to St. Magnus’s church and visited the saint’s
shrine. The same day, he took a bath and had himself shaved. That night,
his illness intensified and he took to his bed once more; everyone
thought that he was getting much worse.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the early stages of his illness, he had Latin books read to him,
but it grew difficult for him to concentrate on what the words meant, so
then he had Norse books read to him day and night. To begin with, he
listened to the lives of saints, and when these ran out, he had the
history of all the kings of Norway read to him, one after another, from
Halfdan the Black onwards.</p>
<p>When King Hakon realized that his condition was deteriorating, he
made arrangements for gifts to be given to the men of his bodyguard in
acknowledgment of their services to him. He ordered that each of them
should receive a burnt mark of silver; and he gave half a mark of silver
to his guests, cup-bearers, and all his other servants. He had his
[silver] dinner-service weighed, except for the gilded items, and
ordered that if the pure silver ran out, the dinner-service should be
divided up so that everyone could have his fair share. Then he had
letters written for King Magnus, explaining all the arrangements that he
thought were most important.</p>
<p>King Hakon was anointed the night before the feast of Saint Lucy [13
December]. These bishops were in attendance: Thorgils, bishop of
Stavanger; Gillibert, bishop of Hammar; and Heinrek, bishop of Orkney.
Abbot Thorleif and many other learned men were present too. Before the
king was anointed, the men who were with him, kissed him. While he was
still capable of speech, he was asked by his confidants if he had any
other son or any other offspring who could be contacted in case,
tragically, he or King Magnus should die. The king was adamant that he
had begotten no son except King Magnus, and no daughter that people did
not know about already. By that time, the reading of kings’ lives had
reached Sverrir, so Sverrir’s saga was begun. The saga was read day and
night when the king was awake.</p>
<ol start="330" type="1">
<li>The feast of Saint Lucy the virgin fell on a Thursday, and, late in
the evening of the following Saturday, the king’s illness grew so much
more serious that he lost the power of speech. The reading of Sverrir’s
saga ended close to midnight, and, just as midnight passed, Almighty God
called the king away from this earthly life [15–16 December, 1263]. This
was a very great grief to everyone there, just as it was to the many
others who heard about it later.</li>
