<h4 id="king-sverrirs-mariasud">34. King Sverrir’s Mariasud</h4>
<p>Great ships took on new significance in the turbulent era of
Norwegian politics of the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries.
King Sverrir of Norway had the Mariasud constructed in the early 1180s,
and the ship played an important role in the battle of Fimreite
(Norafjord) in 1184 (see doc. 37d). From Sverrir’s Saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Sverris saga, ed. Þorleifur
Hauksson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXV (Reykjavík, 2007), pp. 123–25.</p>
<ol start="80" type="1">
<li>During the summer in which King Sverrir captured the ships in
Bergen, the building of the Mariasud was completed, and King Sverrir
came north in the autumn to have it launched. The ship had been built
above the town and many people said that it could not be launched
without demolishing some of the houses. People also said that, in
building the ship, the king had behaved arrogantly and ostentatiously
and that nothing good would come of it. However, when the ship was
launched, it turned out that the king had foreseen the problem and had
planned the launch in such a way that there was no need to demolish any
houses or buildings.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the ship shot forward from the stocks into the river, some of
its joints sprang open. This happened because, while Sverrir was south
in Møre during the winter, the ship was being built in Kaupang and, by
the time the king returned, nine rows of planks had been completed on
each side. When the king saw what had been done, he said, “This ship is
much smaller than I’d anticipated. Take it apart and insert a piece
twelve ells long in the middle of the keel” [a Norwegian ell was 62.8
cm].</p>
<p>The shipwright objected, but the king was adamant. As a result, there
were many joints at the bottom of the ship and, when it was launched,
some of them opened up. King Sverrir was aboard the ship when it hit the
water.</p>
<p>“Praise be to God, the Virgin Mary, and St. Olaf that this ship has
got into the water safely without harming anyone,” said the king. “As
for the many people who bad-mouthed me, may God forgive them. I don’t
imagine that many here have seen as big a longship as this afloat on the
water. This ship will be a great defense against our enemies if good
luck goes with it. I entrust this ship to the protection and
safe-keeping of the Virgin Mary. I name it Mariasud and pray that the
Blessed Virgin will defend and guard it. As a token of this, I will
bestow on Mary vestments that the archbishop can wear when he is
splendidly dressed for solemn feasts, treasures fit for the service of
God. I hope that she will look favorably on these gifts and grant
support and good fortune to the ship, the crew, and everyone on
board.”</p>
<p>The king had holy relics inserted in the carved prow and stern of the
ship. He distributed the vestments, sending the cope to the Mariakirk,
the gown to Helgaset, and everything else to Nunnaset at Bakki.</p>
<p>The Mariasud was not an elegant ship. The prow and the stern were
small in proportion to the mid-section, mainly because the ship had been
lengthened. The king had repairs done to the damage caused by the
launch. During the winter, he had more longships built and others
refitted. All the work was carried out to the highest standards. Thorolf
Rympill’s ship, the Hjalp, was built at this time. It had twenty-six
rooms [rowers’ benches]. Ulf from Laufness’s ship, the Vidsja, was also
built at this time, and had almost as many rooms as the Hjalp.</p>
<ol start="81" type="1">
<li>After Easter, King Sverrir got ready to travel south from Kaupang
with thirty-three ships, most of which were large. With him went his
brother Eirik, Ulf from Laufness, Ulf Fly, Bard Guthormsson, Ivar Selki,
and Havard Earlsson. Together, they made up a large and splendid force.
The king commanded the Mariasud with two hundred and eighty men aboard.
He had three chests sent out to the ship and each chest had to be
carried by four men; no one knew what was in them. The king’s son Eirik
was in command of the Oskmey, a ship which had about twenty-five
rooms….</li>
</ol>
<p>They headed to the Herey Islands and there the king held another
council at which he said exactly the same things as he had said before.
From the Herey Islands, he sailed south past Stad, but a sharp wind blew
up and they ran into rough weather. This put a great strain on the
Mariasud, causing its seams to open, so the king turned in to Ulf’s
Sound. When they anchored there, the men found out what was in the big
chests, for ship’s nails were taken out of them and distributed among
the ships. The king gave nails to the men in each half-room [rowing
space] and told them to keep their eyes open and use the nails whenever
necessary. Then Sverrir sailed on his way to Sogn….</p>
