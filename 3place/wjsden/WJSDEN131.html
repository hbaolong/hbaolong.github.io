<h4 id="the-conversion-of-greenland-aaaaaaaa">94. The Conversion of
Greenland AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Leif Eiriksson was charged by Olaf Tryggvason with the conversion of
Greenland. On his way to introduce Christianity to Greenland, Leif
Eiriksson was driven off course and saw Vinland for the first time.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Eiriks saga Rauða, in Eyrbyggja
saga, ed. Einar Ól. Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit IV
(Reykjavík, 1935), pp. 413–16.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Eirik’s wife was called Thjodhild. He had two sons by her, named
Thorstein and Leif, both of whom were promising men. Thorstein was at
home with his father, and no one in Greenland was so highly regarded.
Leif had sailed to Norway and was with King Olaf Tryggvason.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, when Leif sailed from Greenland in the summer, he and his
crew were blown off course to the Hebrides. A favorable wind was a long
time coming to them, and they stayed there for much of the summer….</p>
<p>Leif and his men sailed from the Hebrides and reached Norway in the
autumn. Leif became one of King Olaf Tryggvason’s retainers and was well
thought of by the king, who regarded him as a highly accomplished man.
On one occasion, the king fell into conversation with Leif and asked,
“Do you mean to go to Greenland in the summer?”</p>
<p>“I do,” replied Leif, “if that is acceptable to you.”</p>
<p>“I think it may well be,” said the king, “if you go there on my
business and preach Christianity.” Leif said that the king should
decide, but he thought that it would be a difficult task to carry out in
Greenland. The king replied that he could see no one better suited than
Leif.</p>
<p>“And you’ll bring good luck to the undertaking,” said the king.</p>
<p>“It will work,” said Leif, “only if I have your good luck with
me.”</p>
<p>Leif set out and, after a long time at sea, he came across land that
he had not previously known. There were fields of self-sown wheat,
full-grown vines, and trees of the sort known as maple. They brought
back proof of all this, including some logs so big that they were used
in house-building. Leif found some men who had been shipwrecked, and
took them back home with him [and put them up for the winter]. In this,
and in many other ways, he showed the greatest generosity and nobility
when he introduced Christianity to Greenland. Forever after, he was
called Leif the Lucky.</p>
<p>Leif made land at Eiriksfjord and went home to Brattahlid where
everyone gave him a great welcome. Straight away, he began to preach
Christianity and the Catholic faith. He made public King Olaf
Tryggvason’s message and explained how many splendid achievements and
what great glory belonged to this religion. Eirik reacted coldly to the
suggestion that he should abandon his religion, but Thjodhild submitted
quickly and had a church built at a considerable distance from the
houses. The church was called Thjodhild’s Church and there she used to
pray along with the others who adopted Christianity. After she adopted
the faith, Thjoldhild would not sleep with Eirik, and that was not much
to his liking.</p>
