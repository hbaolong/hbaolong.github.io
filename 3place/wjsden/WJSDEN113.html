Grettir Helps around the Farm AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Grettis saga Ásmundarsonar,
ed. Guðni Jónsson, Íslenzk Fornrit VII (Reykjavík, 1936), pp. 37–41.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>….Grettir grew up at Bjarg until he was ten years old. After that,
he got bigger more quickly, and Asmund told him to do some work. Grettir
said he didn’t feel that work would suit him too well but asked what he
was to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>“You must tend my geese,” replied Asmund.</p>
<p>“That’s stupid work, fit for the feeble-minded,” said Grettir.</p>
<p>“You do a good job of that and things will get better between us,”
answered Asmund.</p>
<p>So Grettir started looking after the geese. There were fifty geese
and lots of goslings. It wasn’t long before he found that they were
really difficult to drive and that the goslings didn’t move very
quickly. He rapidly became very angry about this because he had little
self-control. Soon after that, some vagrants found the goslings dead and
the geese with their wings broken. Asmund was furious and asked Grettir
if he had killed the fowls. Grettir grinned and said:</p>
<p>Come winter time, for sure</p>
<p>I’ll twist the goslings’ necks;</p>
<p>and if the parents show up,</p>
<p>I’ll take care of them too.</p>
<p>“You’ll take no more care of them,” said Asmund.</p>
<p>“It’s a friend who warns another of misfortune,” replied
Grettir….</p>
<p>Some time later, Asmund told Grettir to take care of his horses.
Grettir said he thought that would be better than scratching his
father’s back beside the fire.</p>
<p>“You’ll do as I ask you,” said Asmund. “I have a light brown mare
with a dark stripe along her back and I call her Kengala. She knows how
the weather will turn out and when there will be rain storms. Whenever
she refuses to go out to graze, there is a storm on the way for sure.
You must look after the horses in the stable and keep them to the north
of the ridge when there is dirty weather. I should think you’ll do
better with this than the other work I have given you.”</p>
<p>“It’s cold work and worthy of a man,” replied Grettir, “but it seems
silly to me to trust a mare; as far as I know no one has had faith in
her before.”</p>
<p>Grettir started looking after the horses and kept at it until after
Yule when heavy cold and snow storms set in, making grazing very
difficult. Grettir didn’t have many clothes and wasn’t accustomed to
harsh conditions. He began to suffer from the cold, but Kengala always
stayed in the most exposed places, however bad the weather. She never
came back to the pasture in time to get home before nightfall. Grettir
thought a lot about how he could play a trick on Kengala and get even
with her for her wandering.</p>
<p>Early one morning, Grettir came to open the stables. There he found
Kengala standing in front of the manger. Enough fodder had been provided
for all the animals, but only Kengala had had any food. Grettir leapt
onto her; in his hand he had a very sharp knife and with this he slashed
across the mare’s shoulders and down both sides of her back. The horse,
well-fed and angry, shied violently and kicked out so hard that her hind
hooves crashed against the walls. Grettir fell off but got back to his
feet and tried to remount. They had a vicious struggle which ended when
Grettir had flayed Kengala all along the dark stripe on her back as far
as the croup. Then he drove the horses out to pasture, but Kengala was
interested only in biting at her back and shortly after noon she took
off and ran back to the stable.</p>
<p>Grettir closed the stable and went home. Asmund asked where the
horses were, and Grettir replied that he had taken care of them in the
stable as usual. Asmund remarked that a storm must be on the way if the
horses would not stay outside in the current good weather.</p>
<p>Grettir said, “Wisdom fails many who expect better.”</p>
<p>Night passed, and no storm came. Grettir drove the horses from the
stable, but Kengala could not bear to stay out in the pasture. Asmund
thought it strange that the weather failed to change.</p>
<p>On the third morning, Asmund went to see the horses, Kengala in
particular.</p>
<p>“The horses don’t seem to have done well in this lovely weather, but
I can at least enjoy stroking your back, Bleikala [Kengala],” said
Asmund.</p>
<p>“The expected happens,” said Grettir, “and so does the
unexpected.”</p>
<p>Asmund stroked the horse’s back and the hide came away in his hand.
Asmund thought this bizarre and said that Grettir must be responsible.
Grettir grinned and answered not a word.</p>
<p>The farmer went home and gave vent to a foul-mouthed tirade. As he
entered the hall, he heard his wife say, “My son’s horse-husbandry must
have worked out well.”</p>
