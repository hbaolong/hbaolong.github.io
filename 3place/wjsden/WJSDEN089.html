<h4 id="river-routes-to-constantinople">64. River Routes to
Constantinople</h4>
<p>The treatise De Administrando Imperio, compiled and written between
948 and 952 by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (r.
945–959), was intended as a confidential manual of kingcraft for his
son. It has been called the most important of the Byzantine sources
concerned with the Rūs. It contains a detailed account of the so-called
Viking Road to Byzantium—the network of waterways, lakes, and portages
that led from Scandinavia to Byzantium (Constantinople); the Dnieper
River was a key artery of this network.</p>
<p>Source: trans. R.J.H. Jenkins, Constantine Porphyrogenitus, De
Administrando Imperio, ed. G. Moravesik (new revised ed.; Washington,
DC: Dumbarton Oaks, 1967), vol. I, pp. 57–63.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>The monoxyla [dugout vessels of varying sizes] which come down from
outer Russia to Constantinople are from Novgorod, where Sviatoslav, son
of Igor, prince of Russia, had his seat and others from the city of
Smolensk and from Teliutza and Chernigov and from Vyshegrad. All these
come down the river Dnieper, and are collected together at the city of
Kiev, also called Sambatas. Their Slav tributaries, the so-called
Krivichians and the Lenzanenes and the rest of the Slavonic regions, cut
the monoxyla on their mountains in time of winter, and when they have
prepared them, as spring approaches, and the ice melts, they bring them
on to the neighboring lakes. And since these lakes debouch into the
river Dnieper, they enter thence on to this same river and come down to
Kiev, and draw the ships along to be finished and sell them to the
Russians. The Russians buy these bottoms only, furnishing them with oars
and rowlocks and other tackle from their old monoxyla, which they
dismantle; and so they fit them out. And in the month of June they move
off down the river Dnieper and come to Vitichev, which is a tributary
city of the Russians, and there they gather during two or three days;
and when all the monoxyla are collected together, then they set out, and
come down the said Dnieper river. And first they come to the first
barrage, called Essoupi, which means in Russian and Slavonic “Do not
sleep!”; the barrage itself is as narrow as the width of the
Polo-ground; in the middle of it are rooted high rocks, which stand out
like islands. Against these, then, comes the water and wells up and
dashes down over the other side, with a mighty and terrific din.
Therefore the Russians do not venture to pass between them, but put in
to the bank hard by, disembarking the men on to dry land leaving the
rest of the goods on board the monoxyla; they then strip and, feeling
with their feet to avoid striking on a rock…. This they do, some at the
prow, some amidships, while others again, in the stern, punt with poles;
and with all this careful procedure they pass this first barrage, edging
round under the river-bank. When they have passed this barrage, they
re-embark the others from the dry land and sail away, and come down to
the second barrage, called in Russian Oulvorsi, and in Slavonic
Ostrovouniprach, which means “the Island of the Barrage.” This one is
like the first, awkward and not to be passed through. Once again they
disembark the men and convey the monoxyla past, as on the first
occasion. Similarly they pass the third barrage also, called Gelandri,
which means in Slavonic “Noise of the Barrage,” and then the fourth
barrage, the big one, called in Russian Aeifor, and in Slavonic Neasit,
because the pelicans nest in the stones of the barrage. At this barrage
all put into land prow foremost, and those who are deputed to keep the
watch with them get out, and off they go, these men, and keep vigilant
watch for the Pechenegs. The remainder, taking up the goods which they
have on board the monoxyla, conduct the slaves in their chains past by
land, six miles, until they are through the barrage. Then, partly
dragging their monoxyla, partly portaging them on their shoulders, they
convey them to the far side of the barrage; and then, putting them on
the river and loading up their baggage, they embark themselves, and
again sail off in them. When they come to the fifth barrage, called in
Russian Varouforos, and in Slavonic Voulniprach, because it forms a
large lake, they again convey their monoxyla through at the edges of the
river, as at the first and second barrages, and arrive at the sixth
barrage, called in Russian Leanti, and in Slavonic Veroutzi, that is
“the Boiling of the Water,” and this too they pass similarly. And thence
they sail away to the seventh barrage, called in Russian Stroukoun, and
in Slavonic Naprezi, which means “Little Barrage.” This they pass at the
so-called ford of Vrar, where the Chersonites cross over from Russia and
the Pechenegs to Cherson; which ford is as wide as the Hippodrome, and,
measured upstream from the bottom as far as the rocks break surface, a
bow-shot in length. It is at this point, therefore, that the Pechenegs
come down and attack the Russians. After traversing this place, they
reach the island called St. Gregory, on which island they perform their
sacrifices because a gigantic oak-tree stands there; and they sacrifice
live cocks. Arrows, too, they peg in round about, and others bread and
meat, or something of whatever each may have, as is their custom. They
also throw lots regarding the cocks, whether to slaughter them, or to
eat them as well, or to leave them alive. From this island onwards the
Russians do not fear the Pecheneg until they reach the river Selinas. So
then they start off thence and sail for four days, until they reach the
lake which forms the mouth of the river, on which is the island of
St. Aitherios. Arrived at this island, they rest themselves there for
two or three days. And they re-equip their monoxyla with such tackle as
is needed, sails and masts and rudders, which they bring with them.
Since this lake is the mouth of this river, as has been said, and
carries on down to the sea, and the island of St. Aitherios lies on the
sea, they come thence to the Dniester River, and having got safely there
they rest again. But when the weather is propitious, they put to sea and
come to the river called Aspros, and after resting there too in like
manner, they again set out and come to the Selinas, to the so-called
branch of the Danube River. And until they are past the river Selinas,
the Pechenegs keep pace with them. And if it happens that the sea casts
a monoxylon on shore, they all put in to land, in order to present a
united opposition to the Pechenegs. But after the Selinas they fear
nobody, but, entering the territory of Bulgaria, they come to the mouth
of the Danube. From the Danube they proceed to the Konopas, and from the
Konopas to Constantia, and from Constantia to the river of Varna, and
from Varna they come to the River Ditzina, all of which are Bulgarian
territory. From the Ditzina they reach the district of Mesembria, and
there at last their voyage, fraught with such travail and terror, such
difficulty and danger, is at an end. The severe manner of life of these
same Russians in winter-time is as follows. When the month of November
begins, their chiefs together with all the Russians at once leave Kiev
and go off on the poliudia, which means “rounds,” that is, to the
Slavonic regions of the Vervians and Drugovichians and Krivichians and
Severians and the rest of the Slavs who are tributaries of the Russians.
There they are maintained throughout the winter, but then once more,
starting from the month of April, when the ice of the Dnieper river
melts, they come back to Kiev. They then pick up their monoxyla, as has
been said above, and fit them out, and come down to Romania….</li>
