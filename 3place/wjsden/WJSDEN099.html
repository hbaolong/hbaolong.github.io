<h4 id="b-the-book-of-settlements-aaaaaaaa">(b) The Book of Settlements
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Book of Settlements (Landnámabók, from landnám, land-taking) is a
detailed account of the discovery and settlement of Iceland in the ninth
and tenth centuries and may have originally been compiled in order to
ensure the property rights of important Icelandic chieftains. It is
arranged in topographical order and preserves the names of about 430
individual settlers, their families, and descendants. Overall, more than
3,000 personal names and about 1,500 farm names appear in it. The text
survives in three different medieval redactions, but in its oldest form
it is thought to date from the early twelfth century. This translation
follows the Sturlubók [Sturla’s Book] text.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Landnámabók, ed. Jakob
Benediktsson, Íslenzk fornrit I (Reykjavík, 1986), pp. 32–46.</p>
<p>S. 1. In his book, On Time, the Venerable Bede mentions a certain
island called Thule which, in other books, is said to be six days
sailing to the north of Britain. He said that there is no daylight there
in winter, and no darkness in summer, when the days are longest. For
this reason learned men are convinced that Thule must be Iceland, for,
in most parts of Iceland the sun shines all night when the days are
longest, and does not appear in the daytime when the nights are longest.
According to written sources, Bede the Priest died 735 years after the
incarnation of our Lord, and more than 100 years before Iceland was
settled by Norwegians.</p>
<p>Before Iceland was settled from Norway, men were already living
there. The Norwegians called these men papar. They were Christians, and
it is generally believed that they had come across the sea from the
west, because Irish books, bells, and croziers were found, leading to
the conclusion that the men were Irish. Moreover, we learn from English
books that in those days there was travel between the two countries.</p>
<p>S. 2. When Iceland was discovered and settled from Norway, Adrian was
pope in Rome and was succeeded by John, the fifth of that name to occupy
the apostolic throne. Louis, son of Louis, was emperor north of the
Alps, while Leo and his son, Alexander, ruled over Constantinople.
Harald Finehair was king of Norway, Eirik Emundsson and his son, Bjorn,
ruled Sweden, and Gorm the Old reigned in Denmark; Alfred the Great and
his son, Edward, ruled England, Kjarval ruled Dublin, and Sigurd the
Mighty was Earl of Orkney….</p>
<p>S. 3. The story goes that some men set sail from Norway to the
Faeroes—people mention Naddod the Viking by name—but they were driven
westward out to sea and discovered a great land there. They went ashore
at Austfjord. Then they climbed a high hill and gazed all round about,
looking for smoke, or any other sign that the land was inhabited, but
they saw nothing at all. In the autumn, they set out for the Faeroes,
and, as they were sailing away from the land, heavy snow fell on the
mountains, so they called the country Snowland. They were full of praise
for it. According to Saemund the Wise, the place in Austfjord where they
landed is now called Reydarfell.</p>
<p>S. 4. A Swede called Gard Svavarsson went in search of Snowland at
the suggestion of his mother, who had the gift of prophecy. He landed to
the east of the eastern Horn, where there was a natural harbor in those
days. Gard circumnavigated the land, and discovered that it was an
island. He spent the winter in the north at Husavik in Skjalfandi and
built a house there. In the spring, when he was ready to sail, a man
called Nattfari made off in a boat, along with a slave and a
servant-woman, and settled in a place that was afterwards called
Nattfaravik. Then Gard sailed to Norway where he praised the island
highly…. After that, it was called Gardarsholm.</p>
<p>S. 5. There was a great Viking called Floki Vilgerdarson who went in
search of Gardarsholm. He set sail from Flokarvard [in Norway], which is
situated where Hordaland and Rogaland meet, and sailed first to the
Shetlands, where he anchored in Floki’s Bay. His daughter, Geirhild,
perished there in Geirhild’s Loch. On board ship with Floki was a farmer
called Thorolf, and another named Herjolf; also on board was a man from
the Hebrides, called Faxi.</p>
<p>Floki had taken three ravens to sea with him. When he released the
first one, it flew over the stern, back in the direction they had come
from. The second one flew straight up into the air, and then returned to
the ship. But the third one took off over the bows and flew ahead of the
ship toward the place where they found land. They approached Horn from
the east and then sailed west along the south coast. As they rounded
Reykjaness, the fjord opened up before them so that they could see
Snaefellsness.</p>
<p>“This land we’ve found must be really big to have such broad rivers,”
said Faxi.</p>
<p>Ever since then, the fjord has been called Faxaoss [Faxi’s
river-mouth].</p>
<p>Floki and his men sailed west over Breidafjord and landed at
Vatsfjord, near Bardastrand. In those days, the fishing in the fjord was
so abundant that they neglected the haymaking and all their animals died
over the winter. The spring was on the cold side, and when Floki climbed
a high hill, he saw a fjord full of drift-ice, to the north beyond the
mountains. So they called the land Iceland, and that is what it has been
called ever since. Floki and his men intended to leave in the summer,
but it was almost winter before they were ready and they could not get
round Reykjaness. Then one of the boats broke loose with Herjolf on
board. He landed at a place that is now called Herjolf’s Haven. Floki
spent the winter in Borgarfjord. The following summer, he and Herjolf
met up again and sailed back to Norway. When they were asked about
Iceland, Floki spoke ill of the place, but Herjolf recounted both the
good and the bad. Thorolf said that butter dripped from every blade of
grass in the land they had discovered, and for that reason he was called
Thorolf Butter….</p>
<p>S. 6. [Two] sworn-brothers, Ingolf and Leif, fitted out a big ship
they owned and went looking for the land, by now called Iceland, which
Floki of the Ravens had discovered. They found the place and stayed at
South Alptafjord in the Eastfjords. They were better pleased with the
southern part of the country than with the north. They stayed in the
land for a winter and then sailed back to Norway.</p>
<p>After that, Ingolf laid their property aside for a journey to
Iceland, but Leif went on a Viking raid in the west. When he was raiding
in Ireland, he found a large earth-house. It was dark when he went in,
until there was a flash of light from a sword that some man was holding.
He killed the man and took the sword and a great deal of money from him.
From then on, Leif was called Hjorleif [the Sword]. Hjorleif raided
throughout Ireland and collected a lot of property. He captured ten
slaves there; their names were: Dufthak, Geirrod, Skaldbjorn, Halldor,
and Drafdit; the others are not named. After that, Hjorleif returned to
Norway where he met his sworn-brother, Ingolf. He had already married
Helga Orn’s daughter, the sister of Ingolf.</p>
<p>S. 7. That winter, Ingolf prepared a great sacrifice hoping to find
omens regarding his future. But Hjorleif would never make sacrificial
offerings. The omens directed Ingolf toward Iceland, so each of the
kinsmen fitted out a ship for the journey. On board Hjorleif’s ship was
his plunder from raiding, while on Ingolf’s ship was the property they
owned jointly. When everything was ready, they put to sea.</p>
<p>S. 8. That summer, when Ingolf and Hjorleif went off to settle
Iceland, Harald Finehair had been king of Norway for twelve years; six
thousand and seventy three years had passed since the beginning of the
world, and eight hundred and seventy four years had gone by since the
birth of Christ.</p>
<p>The sworn-brothers sailed in convoy until they sighted Iceland, but
then they got separated. When Ingolf saw Iceland, he threw his high-seat
pillars overboard, hoping for an omen, and vowed that he would settle
wherever the pillars came ashore. He landed at a place now known as
Ingolf’s Headland, but Hjorleif was driven west along the coast. He ran
out of drinking water, so his Irish slaves began to knead meal and
butter together, claiming that this would slake their thirst: they
called the mixture minnthak. No sooner was it prepared than there was a
heavy rain, and they collected water in the awnings. When the minnthak
grew moldy, they tossed it overboard, and it drifted ashore at the place
now called Minnthak’s Shoal.</p>
<p>Hjorleif landed at Hjorleif’s Head where there was a fjord that cut
into the headland. Hjorleif had two halls built there. One of them was
eighteen fathoms long, and the other was nineteen fathoms. Hjorleif
spent the winter there, intending to sow seed in the spring. Since he
had only one ox, he made his slaves draw the plow. While Hjorlief and
his companions were busy about the house, Dufthak suggested to the
slaves that they should slaughter the ox and say that a bear had killed
it. Then they should kill Hjorleif and his companions when they went
looking for the bear. So they told this tale to Hjorleif, and when he
and his comrades fanned out through the woods in search of the bear, the
slaves attacked them one by one and killed them all…. There were as many
dead men as there were slaves. Then they fled in the boat, taking with
them the wives and property of the murdered men, and sailed to some
islands that they had seen to the south-west. They settled there for a
while.</p>
<p>Two of Ingolf’s slaves were called Karli and Vifil. He sent them west
along the coast to look for his high-seat pillars, and, when they got to
Hjorleif’s Head, they found Hjorlief dead. They went back and broke the
news to Ingolf, who was greatly upset by Hjorleif’s murder. He went west
to Hjorleif’s Head and, when he saw Hjorleif’s body, he said, “It’s a
sorry fate for a brave warrior to be murdered by slaves. But now I see
what happens to people who won’t sacrifice.”</p>
<p>Ingolf saw to the burial of Hjorleif and his men and took possession
of their ship and property. Afterwards, he went up to the headland. He
noticed that there were some islands lying to the south-west and, since
the boat was missing, it occurred to him that the slaves might have gone
there. So they went in search of the slaves, and found them in the
islands at a place called Eid. When Ingolf and his men came upon them,
they were having a meal and were so panic-stricken that they fled in all
directions. Ingolf killed the lot of them. Dufthak died at a place
called Dufthak’s cliff. Most of the slaves jumped off a precipice that
has since been named after them, and the islands where the slaves were
killed are now known as Vestmannaeyjar [the Isles of the Westerners]
because those who were slain there came from the west [from Ireland].
Then Ingolf and his men returned to Hjorleif’s Head, taking the wives of
the murdered men with them. Ingolf stayed there for a second winter. The
following summer he headed west along the coast and spent the third
winter near Ingolfsfell, to the west of the Olfu River. It was at this
time that Vifil and Karli found the high-seat pillars down from the
heath near Arnarshval [Orn’s Hill].</p>
<p>S. 9. In the spring, Ingolf crossed the heath and settled at
Reykjavik, where his high-seat pillars had come ashore. The pillars are
still standing in the hall there. Ingolf took possession of the land
between the Olfu river and Hvalfjord [Whale Fjord] beyond the Brynjudal
river. He also took the land from there to the Axe river, and all the
headlands in the area. Then Karli said, “There was no point in traveling
over all that fine countryside, just to settle on this remote
headland.”</p>
<p>So he left, taking a servant-woman with him. Ingolf gave Vifil his
freedom and he settled at Vifil’s Homestead; Vifil’s Fell is named after
him too. He lived there for a long time and became a respectable man.
Ingolf had a hall built at Skali Fell; from it he noticed some smoke
near Olfuvatn and found Karli living there.</p>
<p>Ingolf was the most renowned of all the settlers, for he came to this
land when it was uninhabited, and was the first to settle it.
Afterwards, other settlers followed his example. Ingolf married Hallveig
Frodi’s daughter, the sister of Lopt the Old. Their son was Thorstein
who set up the Thing [assembly] at Kjalarness before the Althing was
established.</p>
