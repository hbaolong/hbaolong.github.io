<h4 id="a-norwegian-soldier-of-fortune-in-the-east-aaaaaaaa">65. A
Norwegian Soldier of Fortune in the East AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The names of many Scandinavians who ventured to the East are known,
but none is as famous as Harald Sigurdarson, better known as Harald
harðráði (Hardradi; Hard-Ruler). A half-brother of Olaf Haraldsson
(St. Olaf, d. 1030), Harald was sole ruler of Norway from 1047 until his
death in 1066 (see doc. 108). But before becoming king of Norway,
Harald’s career took him to the East, first in the service of Jaroslav,
the ruler of Kiev, and subsequently in the service of the Byzantine
emperor as leader of the famous Varangian guard. The most gripping
account of Harald’s career is his saga in Snorri Sturluson’s
Heimskringla, and while some folkloric elements and geographical errors
have crept into the saga, Harald’s presence and campaigns in the East
are also recorded in an eleventh-century Greek text. The saga account
provides valuable insight into the employment of Scandinavian
mercenaries in the East, though Harald’s experiences as a prince must
have differed from those of the rank-and-file.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Haralds saga
Sigurðarson, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk fornrit
XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 3, pp. 71–90.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>At that time, Queen Zoe the Great [ca 978–1050] ruled over Greece
[Byzantine Empire] together with Michael Katalactus [r. 1034–41]. When
Harald arrived in Mikligard [Constantinople], he went to see the queen
and entered her service as a mercenary soldier. That autumn, he sailed
with the galleys that were transporting soldiers to the Greek Sea. He
was in charge of a company of his own men.</li>
</ol>
<p>In those days, the commander of the army was one of the queen’s
relatives, a man called Gyrgir. But before long the Varangians allied
themselves with Harald, and formed up with him and his men whenever
there was a battle. Eventually, Harald became leader of all the
Varangians. Gyrgir and his army sailed all through the Greek islands,
making frequent attacks on corsairs….</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>When Harald arrived in Sicily he went on raiding expeditions and
then camped with his army beside a large, populous city. He settled in
for a siege, for the city had strong walls, and he didn’t think he could
breach them.</li>
</ol>
<p>The citizens had plenty of food and whatever else they needed to
withstand a siege. So Harald hit on a plan. He had his fowlers catch
some little birds which nested in the city and flew out to the forest
during the day to find food. Then he had chips of resinous wood, smeared
with wax and brimstone, attached to the birds’ backs and set alight. The
instant the birds were released, they all flew straight back to the city
to seek out their young and their nests in the thatched roofs. The fire
then spread from the birds to the house-thatches, which were made of
reeds or straw. Even though each bird carried only a small spark of
fire, there was soon a huge conflagration as lots of birds brought fire
to thatches throughout the city. One house after another burst into
flames until the whole city was ablaze.</p>
<p>The inhabitants abandoned the city and begged for mercy, even the
ones who had often spoken haughtily and dismissively about the Greek
army and its leaders. Harald spared everyone who asked for mercy and
took control of the city….</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Harald spent many years in this sort of warfare, both in the land of
the Saracens and in Sicily. Afterwards, he returned to Mikligard with
the army, and stayed there for a short while before setting out on a
journey to Palestine. He left behind the gold he had got from the Greek
king as payment for his services, and so did all the Varangians who went
with him. It is said that Harald fought eighteen major battles in the
course of his campaigns. Thjodolf says:</li>
</ol>
<p>People have heard that Harald</p>
<p>fought eighteen fierce fights;</p>
<p>in that prince’s presence,</p>
<p>peace often perished;</p>
<p>the eagle’s gray claws grew</p>
<p>blood-red and the ravening</p>
<p>wolf ate well</p>
<p>before Harald headed home.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Harald sailed to Palestine with his army and then went overland to
Jerusalem. Wherever he went, every town and castle was surrendered to
him. Here is Stuf the skald’s account of these events—he heard them
related by the king himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>From Greece, the great king</p>
<p>came to conquer Jerusalem;</p>
<p>without effort he easily</p>
<p>got control of the country;</p>
<p>without battle or burnings,</p>
<p>the whole land laid itself</p>
<p>under his princely power.</p>
<p>Joyfully, may the mighty Harald</p>
<p>[the last line to be read with the last</p>
<p>line of the next stanza]</p>
<p>Here we are told that the land came under Harald’s control without
being burned or plundered. Then he went to the River Jordan and bathed
in it, as is the custom of pilgrims. He donated great treasures to the
Lord’s tomb, as well as to the holy cross and other sacred relics in
Palestine, and made the road safe all the way to the Jordan by killing
robbers and plunderers. Thus says Stuf:</p>
<p>His wrath being roused,</p>
<p>the kingly commander</p>
<p>targeted the treacherous</p>
<p>on both banks of the Jordan;</p>
<p>for their evil acts</p>
<p>the prince punished</p>
<p>all his enemies.</p>
<p>live forever with the Lord.</p>
<p>[the last line to be read with the last line of</p>
<p>the previous stanza]</p>
<p>Then he returned to Mikligard.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>When Harald got back to Mikligard from Palestine, he grew anxious to
return to his ancestral estates in the Northlands, for he had heard that
his nephew Magnus Olafsson had become king of both Norway and Denmark.
He declared his intention of ending his service with the king, but when
Queen Zoe heard about this, she was furious. She accused Harald of
misappropriating valuables, which had been seized as plunder when he was
in command of the army, but which rightfully belonged to the Greek
king.</li>
</ol>
<p>Harald had asked for the hand of a beautiful, young girl—Queen Zoe’s
niece, Maria—but the queen had refused. According to Varangians here in
the north who had served as mercenaries in Mikligard, it was the opinion
of people in the know there that the queen wanted to marry Harald
herself. This, they said, was the real reason for her accusations
against him when he wanted to leave Mikligard—though people were led to
believe something different. And this explains why the Greek king had
Harald arrested and thrown into a dark dungeon. The king at that time
was Constantine Monomach [ca 1000–1055], who ruled together with Queen
Zoe.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>As Harald approached the prison, King Olaf the saint appeared to him
and said that he would help him. Afterwards, a chapel was built in that
street and dedicated to Saint Olaf. It has stood there ever since. The
prison consisted of a tall tower, open at the top, and with a door
leading into it from the street. Harald was thrown into this prison,
along with Halldor and Ulf [two Icelanders], but the very next night, a
rich lady and two of her servants climbed up ladders to the top of the
tower. Then they lowered a rope into the prison and pulled up Harald and
his men. King Olaf the saint had once cured this lady of a sickness and
had appeared to her and asked her to free his brother [Harald].</li>
</ol>
<p>King Harald went straight to the Varangians, and they all got up and
welcomed him. Then they armed themselves and went to the king’s
bedchamber. There they seized the king and put out both his eyes.
Thorarin Skeggjason says in his drápa:</p>
<p>Our king came by</p>
<p>much gold in Greece;</p>
<p>but the emperor is eyeless</p>
<p>after terrible torture.</p>
<p>Thjodolf the skald says:</p>
<p>The healer of wolves’ woes,</p>
<p>our great lord, gouged</p>
<p>out the emperor’s eyes</p>
<p>—that was the start of the strife;</p>
<p>over in the east</p>
<p>the lord of Agder left</p>
<p>a cruel mark on a manly king;</p>
<p>rough was the Greek king’s road.</p>
<p>In these two drápas, and in many other poems about Harald, it is
clearly stated that he himself blinded the Greek king. A chieftain, or
an earl, or some other high-born man would have been named if it had
been known for sure that he had done it. But this story was spread by
Harald himself and by the men who were there with him.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>The same night, Harald and his men went to the house where Maria
slept and abducted her. Then they went to the Varangian galleys, took
two of them, and rowed into the Golden Horn until they reached the point
where iron chains are stretched across the sound. Harald ordered the
crews of both galleys to ply their oars and told all the men who were
not rowing to run toward the stern, carrying their leather bags. In this
way, they ran the galleys up onto the iron chains, where they stuck
fast. Harald immediately ordered his men to run to the bows. This
movement tipped Harald’s galley forward and pitched it free of the
chains with a shudder, but the other galley remained hung up on the
chains and broke apart. Some of the crew were pulled from the water, but
many of them drowned there.</li>
</ol>
<p>That is how Harald escaped from Mikligard and entered the Black Sea,
but before he sailed away, he put the young woman ashore and provided
her with several attendants to escort her back to Mikligard. Harald told
her to point out to Zoe how little control she had over him and how,
with all her power, she was unable to prevent him from abducting the
girl. Then he sailed north to the mouth of the Dnieper and from there he
traveled all over the eastern realm….</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>When Harald came to Holmgard [Novgorod], King Jarizleif [ca
978–1054] gave him a splendid welcome. He stayed there for the winter
and took charge of all the gold and the many other treasures that he had
sent from Mikligard. No one in the Northlands had ever seen so much
wealth in the possession of one man for, while he was in Mikligard,
Harald had participated in “palace-pillaging” three times. It was the
law there that when a Greek king died, the Varangians had pillaging
rights at his palaces. They were permitted to go through all the king’s
treasuries and each man could help himself freely to whatever he could
lay his hands on.</li>
