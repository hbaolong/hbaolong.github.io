<h4 id="a-olaf-tryggvason-at-the-battle-of-svold">(a) Olaf Tryggvason at
the Battle of Svold</h4>
<p>In response to Olaf’s territorial ambitions, Svein Forkbeard, king of
Denmark, Olaf Eiriksson, king of Sweden, and Eirik, earl of Lade, formed
a confederation against him, though Snorri suggests that Svein Forkbeard
encouraged the alliance for more personal reasons. In 1000, as he sailed
home from an expedition to Wendland (Pomerania), Olaf was intercepted by
the combined fleets of his enemies. The location of Svold is uncertain,
but most authorities place it in the western Baltic Sea. From Olaf
Tryggvason’s Saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Óláfs saga
Tryggvasonar, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 1, pp. 348–68.</p>
<ol start="97" type="1">
<li>King Olaf traveled south along the coast [of Norway] with his fleet.
He was joined by many of his friends and by other powerful men who were
ready and willing to make the journey. The most important of these was
his brother-in-law, Erling Skjalgsson, who brought a large,
well-equipped ship of sixty oars. The king’s brothers-in-law, Hyrning
and Thorgeir, also joined him, each with a large ship, and many other
great men followed him too. When he left Norway, the king had sixty
longships. He sailed south toward Denmark, through Eyrarsund and on to
Wendland [Pomerania] where he arranged to meet King Burislaf.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the kings met, they discussed the property claimed by King Olaf.
The talks went well and King Olaf’s claims were settled quickly.
Afterwards, he stayed on for much of the summer and met many of his
friends there.</p>
<ol start="98" type="1">
<li>Svein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, was married to Sigrid the Proud,
as has already been related. Sigrid was very hostile to King Olaf
Tryggvason because he had broken his engagement to her, and had struck
her in the face. She was continually urging King Svein to go to war with
Olaf Tryggvason, saying that he had a good enough reason seeing that
King Olaf had married Svein’s sister, Thura, without his permission.
“None of your ancestors would have put up with that,” she said.</li>
</ol>
<p>Queen Sigrid kept making remarks like this. As a result of her
pressure, King Svein was quite willing to fall in with this plan of
action.</p>
<p>Early in the spring, King Svein sent messengers to his
brother-in-law, King Olaf of Sweden [ca 980–ca 1022], and to Earl Eirik
[Eirik Hakonarson, ca 960–ca 1020] to let them know that Olaf, king of
Norway, had gathered men and ships and intended to travel to Wendland in
the summer. Svein went on to suggest that the king of Sweden and Earl
Eirik should call out an army and meet up with him so that together they
could make war on Olaf Tryggvason. The king and the earl were quite
ready to take part in this expedition. They assembled a large fleet in
Sweden and, with this force, they went south to Denmark. When they
arrived there, King Olaf Tryggvason had already sailed east. Halldor the
Heathen tells of this in his poem about Earl Eirik:</p>
<p>King-destroying Eirik came with</p>
<p>his army south from Sweden;</p>
<p>the storm-strong earl ordered men</p>
<p>to the sword-blaze of battle.</p>
<p>Warriors, the feeders of wound-wasps,</p>
<p>followed Earl Eirik;</p>
<p>flesh-feeding fowls</p>
<p>sipped blood at sea.</p>
<p>The king of Sweden and Earl Eirik sailed to meet the king of the
Danes and together they had a huge army.</p>
<ol start="99" type="1">
<li>After he had called out his army, King Svein dispatched Earl Sigvald
to Wendland to keep an eye on Olaf Tryggvason’s movements and to lure
him into an encounter with Svein and his allies. Earl Sigvald made his
way to Wendland. He came first to Jomsborg and then went to meet King
Olaf Tryggvason. Their conversation was very friendly and the earl
ingratiated himself with the king. Sigvald’s wife, Astrid, was the
daughter of King Burislaf. She was a close friend of Olaf Tryggvason
mainly because of their earlier ties when King Olaf was married to her
sister, Geira. Earl Sigvald was a wise and cunning man and, when he had
worked his way into King Olaf’s confidence, he found various reasons for
delaying the king’s journey back to Norway. Olaf’s men took this very
badly for they were anxious to get home; they were ready to sail, and
the wind was favorable.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sigvald received secret intelligence from Denmark that the armies
were ready and that Svein, Olaf, and Eirik would come east to Wendland,
where they would lie in wait for King Olaf at an island called Svold.
Sigvald was to lure King Olaf into an encounter with them there.</p>
<ol start="100" type="1">
<li>A rumor reached Wendland that Svein, king of the Danes, had
mobilized his army and that he meant to attack King Olaf Tryggvason. But
Earl Sigvald said to the king, “Given the size of your force, King Svein
won’t be planning to fight against you with the Danish army alone.
Still, if you are at all suspicious that you may be heading into
trouble, I’ll follow you with my fleet. Rulers have always thought it an
advantage to have the Jomsvikings on their side. I can offer you eleven
well-manned ships.”</li>
</ol>
<p>The king agreed to this and, as there was a light but favorable wind,
he ordered the fleet to cast off and had the signal blown for departure.
The sails were hoisted. The small ships all got underway quickly and put
to sea ahead of the others. But Earl Sigvald sailed close to the king’s
ship and hailed him.</p>
<p>“Follow me,” he said. “I know where the sounds between the islands
are deepest and you will need depth for the big ships.”</p>
<p>So the earl took the lead with his eleven ships, and the king
followed with his large ships, which were also eleven in number; but the
rest of the fleet sailed out to sea. When Earl Sigvald came near Svold,
a cutter rowed out to meet him. The crew told the earl that the Danish
fleet was lying in the harbor there. At that, the earl ordered the sails
of his ships to be lowered, and his fleet rowed close in to the island.
Halldor the Heathen says this:</p>
<p>From the south sailed King Olaf</p>
<p>with seventy-one warships.</p>
<p>The sword of the sea-king</p>
<p>was bloodied in battle;</p>
<p>Eirik summoned ships from Slaney,</p>
<p>called their fleet to the fight;</p>
<p>peace fell apart</p>
<p>and war was awakened.</p>
<p>The poem relates that King Olaf and Earl Sigvald had seventy-one
ships when they sailed from the south.</p>
<ol start="101" type="1">
<li>Svein, king of the Danes, King Olaf of Sweden, and Earl Eirik were
at Svold with their whole fleet. The weather was fine, and the sun shone
brightly. All the chieftains and their retinues landed on the island and
surveyed the vessels sailing close together out at sea. Then they saw a
large and splendid ship. Both kings said, “That ship is big and very
beautiful. It must be the Long Serpent.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In reply, Earl Eirik said that it was not the Long Serpent, and he
was right. That ship belonged to Kindred of Gemstar. Shortly afterwards,
they saw another ship, much bigger than the first. King Svein said,</p>
<p>“Olaf Tryggvason must be afraid now, for he doesn’t dare sail with
the figurehead on his ship.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the king’s ship,” replied Earl Eirik. “I know that ship
and its striped sail. That’s Erling Skjalgsson. Let them sail by. It’s
better for us if a well-equipped ship like that goes on its way; it will
reduce the strength of Olaf’s fleet.”</p>
<p>Later, they recognized Earl Sigvald’s ships heading toward the
island. Then they saw three other ships sailing by, and one of them was
very large. King Svein said that this was the Long Serpent and ordered
them to embark.</p>
<p>“They have many other great and splendid ships besides the Long
Serpent,” said Earl Eirik. “Let’s wait a while.”</p>
<p>“Earl Eirik won’t fight to avenge his father,” many men said. “That
is a disgrace, for everyone will hear about it if we sit here with such
a large fleet while King Olaf sails right past us.”</p>
<p>After discussing this for a while, they saw four ships sailing up,
and one of them was a huge warship, its dragon’s head heavily decorated
with gold. Then King Svein stood up and said, “The Long Serpent will
carry me high tonight, for I shall steer it.”</p>
<p>Many men declared that the Long Serpent was a truly mighty and
splendid ship, and that only a great man would have built such a
magnificent vessel.</p>
<p>Earl Eirik said, loudly enough for people to hear him, “Even if King
Olaf had only that one ship, King Svein could never capture it with the
Danish army alone.”</p>
<p>The men then rushed to their ships and took down the awnings. While
the leaders were talking together, as has just been related, they saw
three large ships sailing by, with a fourth bringing up the rear; this
was the Long Serpent. As for the great ships, which they had mistaken
for the Long Serpent as they sailed by before, the first was the Crane
and the second was the Short Serpent. But when they saw the Long
Serpent, everyone was quite certain that Olaf Tryggvason must be aboard
such a vessel, so they went down to their ships and prepared for the
attack.</p>
<p>The three leaders—Earl Eirik, Olaf of Sweden, and King Svein—agreed
that each of them would have a third of Norway, if they brought down
King Olaf Tryggvason and that whichever one of them was first to board
the Long Serpent would get the ship and all its contents. Also, each of
them would keep whatever ships he himself put out of action. Earl Eirik
had a very large warship which he was accustomed to take on Viking
raids. At the top of both the prow and the stern, there were iron spikes
and below these there was thick iron plating, as wide as the keel, which
extended all the way down to the water-line.</p>
<ol start="102" type="1">
<li>When the commander of the Crane, Thorkel Dyrthil, and the steersmen
of the accompanying ships saw that Earl Sigvald’s fleet had rowed close
in to the island, they lowered their sails and rowed after him. They
hailed Sigvald’s men and asked why they had turned in this direction.
The earl replied that he wanted to wait for King Olaf.</li>
</ol>
<p>“I suspect that there’s trouble ahead of us,” he said.</p>
<p>They let their ships drift there until Thorkel Nefja came up in the
Short Serpent, along with the three ships that were following him. They
were told the same tale, so they lowered their sails, hove to, and
waited for Olaf Tryggvason. As soon as the king sailed in toward the
island, the whole enemy fleet rowed out into the sound to meet him. When
his men saw this, they urged the king to stay on course and avoid battle
with such a large fleet. The king was standing on the quarter-deck and
answered in a loud voice,</p>
<p>“Lower the sails. My men will never think of fleeing, and I have
never fled from a battle. God may do as he wants with my life, but I’ll
never run for it.” The king’s orders were carried out. Hallfred relates
it thus:</p>
<p>Let me recall the king’s words:</p>
<p>it is said the mail-clad man,</p>
<p>spoke spiritedly</p>
<p>on the brink of battle;</p>
<p>the conquering King Olaf</p>
<p>forbade the thought of flight;</p>
<p>the prince, beloved of his people,</p>
<p>spoke warrior’s words that endure.</p>
<ol start="103" type="1">
<li>King Olaf Tryggvason had the trumpets blown to summon his ships
together for battle. The king’s ship was in the center of the line, with
the Short Serpent on one side, and the Crane on the other. When they
began to tie the ships together for battle, they lashed the prows of the
Long Serpent and the Short Serpent together. Seeing this, King Olaf
called to his men in a loud voice and ordered them to position the big
ship further forward, so that it wouldn’t stretch out behind the other
ships. Ulf the Red replied,</li>
</ol>
<p>“If we line up the sterns, then the Long Serpent will jut out far in
front of the other ships, and we’ll have a rough time of it in the
bows.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know that I had a man in the bows as yellow as he’s red,”
said King Olaf.</p>
<p>“Just you make sure to defend the stern, as well as I will defend the
bow,” replied Ulf the Red. The king laid an arrow to his bow and aimed
at Ulf. “Shoot it somewhere else where it will do more good,” said Ulf.
“What I do, I do for you, king.”</p>
<ol start="104" type="1">
<li>King Olaf stood on the quarter-deck of the Long Serpent. He was a
conspicuous figure. His gilt shield and helmet made him clearly
recognizable, as did the short scarlet tunic that he wore over his chain
mail. He noticed that the enemy ships were forming up and that the
chiefs opposing him had raised their standards.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Who is leading the group directly opposite us?” he asked. One of his
men told him that it was King Svein Forkbeard with the Danish army.
“We’re not afraid of these cowards,” said King Olaf. “The Danes are not
noted for their courage. But whose standards are those to the right of
the Danes?”</p>
<p>He was told that they belonged to King Olaf of Sweden. “He and his
men would be better off at home licking their sacrificial bowls instead
of rowing in under a hail of weapons to attack the Serpent,” said Olaf
Tryggvason. “But who owns those large ships on the port side of the
Danes?”</p>
<p>“Earl Eirik Hakonarson,” was the answer. “He must certainly think he
has good reason to fight us,” said King Olaf, “and we can expect a
fierce battle with that lot, for they are Norsemen, like ourselves.”</p>
<ol start="105" type="1">
<li>Then the kings prepared for the attack. King Svein steered his ship
toward the Long Serpent. King Olaf of Sweden sailed out to one side and
engaged the outermost ship in Olaf Tryggvason’s line, while Earl Eirik
attacked on the other side. A savage fight broke out, but Earl Sigvald
just moved his ships to and fro and did not join the battle. Skuli
Thorsteinsson, who was with Earl Eirik at that time, says this about the
battle:</li>
</ol>
<p>I followed Eirik, the Frisians’ foe,</p>
<p>and Sigvald to where spears sang out;</p>
<p>we brought bloody swords</p>
<p>south to Svold</p>
<p>to meet the wielder of iron weapons</p>
<p>in the deadly din of battle.</p>
<p>Young then, I found fame,</p>
<p>but now all see I’m growing old.</p>
<p>Hallfred also speaks about this event:</p>
<p>Many turned tail</p>
<p>and you, who brought on the battle,</p>
<p>sorely missed the support</p>
<p>of Trondheim’s troops;</p>
<p>a single brave sovereign</p>
<p>battled two bold kings,</p>
<p>and Earl Eirik as a third;</p>
<p>it is a fine custom to tell such tales.</p>
<ol start="106" type="1">
<li>This fight was very bitter and bloody. The men at the bows of the
Long Serpent, the Short Serpent, and the Crane threw anchors and
grappling hooks into King Svein’s ships. They hurled weapons down on the
men below them and cleared everyone off the ships they grappled. King
Svein and the survivors of his army fled to other ships and got
themselves out of weapon range as quickly as they could. And so Svein’s
army fared just as badly as King Olaf Tryggvason had said it would. Then
King Olaf of Sweden moved into King Svein’s place but, as soon as he
came close to the great ships, his force suffered as badly as Svein’s
had done. They lost many men and some of their ships and, given the
circumstances, they withdrew.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, Earl Eirik laid his ship, the Ironbeard, alongside the
outermost ship in Olaf Tryggvason’s line. He cleared the ship of men and
cut it free from the ropes connecting it with the fleet. Then he moved
on to the next ship and fought until it, too, was cleared. Now the men
began to leap from the small ships to the larger ones, and the earl cut
loose each ship as soon as it was put out of action. Then the Danes and
the Swedes moved back into shooting range on all sides of Olaf
Tryggvason’s ships. But Earl Eirik was constantly alongside the enemy
ships and was always engaged in close fighting, and, as soon as men died
on his ships, they were replaced by Danes and Swedes. As Halldor
says:</p>
<p>The clash of keen swords</p>
<p>spoke loud on the Long Serpent,</p>
<p>gold-worked spears sang out</p>
<p>while warriors tore peace apart;</p>
<p>Earl Eirik led,</p>
<p>Danes and Swedish forces followed</p>
<p>into close combat</p>
<p>in the south, at Svold.</p>
<p>Then the battle reached its crisis, and many men fell. Finally, all
of King Olaf’s ships were cleared except the Long Serpent, and all his
men who were still able to fight gathered on board this one ship. Then,
Earl Eirik brought the Ironbeard alongside the Long Serpent and
hand-to-hand fighting broke out. As Halldor says:</p>
<p>Last year, the Long Serpent</p>
<p>encountered cruel trials;</p>
<p>sword struck sword,</p>
<p>shields were shattered.</p>
<p>Earl Eirik laid Ironbeard</p>
<p>alongside the Long Serpent;</p>
<p>he won the war of weapons,</p>
<p>at Svold in the south.</p>
<ol start="107" type="1">
<li>Earl Eirik was standing near the stern of his ship where he and his
men were protected by a shield-wall. They were fighting with swords and
axes; they were throwing spears and anything else that could be employed
as a missile. Some used bows; others used their hands to hurl weapons.
The Long Serpent was now completely surrounded by warships and there was
such a hail of weapons and spears, and such a dense rain of arrows that
the men on the Serpent could scarcely protect themselves with their
shields. King Olaf’s men grew so frantic that they leapt up onto the
sides of their ship, trying to kill their antagonists with sword
strokes. But few of the enemy ships lay close enough to the Serpent for
sword fights and most of Olaf’s men, behaving as though they were
fighting on dry land, simply kept on going and went over the side and
sank under the weight of their weapons. Thus says Hallfred:</li>
</ol>
<p>Warriors wounded in the spear-fight</p>
<p>sank down from the Long Serpent;</p>
<p>but they did not flinch from the fight,</p>
<p>mighty in their ringed-mail;</p>
<p>wherever the Long Serpent sails,</p>
<p>even guided by the greatest of steersmen,</p>
<p>she will long lack</p>
<p>king and crewmen like these.</p>
<ol start="108" type="1">
<li>Einar Thambarskelf, the strongest archer there, was wielding his bow
just below the quarter-deck of the Long Serpent. He shot at Earl Eirik
and hit the top of the rudder just above his head with such force that
the arrow-head was completely embedded. The earl looked in Einar’s
direction and asked if anyone knew who had fired the arrow. He had no
sooner spoken than another arrow flew between his side and his arm and
struck the steersman’s headboard so hard that the point came through on
the other side. Then the earl spoke to a man called Finn who was a
first-rate archer:</li>
</ol>
<p>“Shoot that big man standing next to the quarter-deck.” Finn shot and
the arrow hit the middle of Einar’s bow just as he was drawing it for a
third time. The bow split in two.</p>
<p>“What broke with so much noise?” asked King Olaf.</p>
<p>“Norway from your grasp, king,” answered Einar.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t as big a break as that,” said the king. “Take my bow and
use it.” The king threw the bow to Einar who caught it. But the moment
he drew it, the wood of the bow flexed beyond the arrow-point. “Too
weak, too weak for a king’s bow,” he cried. He threw the bow back and
fought with his sword and shield.</p>
<ol start="109" type="1">
<li>King Olaf Tryggvason stood on the quarter-deck of the Long Serpent
and spent most of the day shooting, sometimes with his bow and sometimes
with spears, which he always threw two at a time. He cast his eye the
length of his ship and noticed that his men were swinging their swords
and slashing vigorously, but the swords were not inflicting many
wounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Why are you striking so feebly with your swords?” asked the king in
a loud voice. “I can see that they aren’t doing much damage.”</p>
<p>“They’re blunt and badly hacked,” someone replied. The king got down
from the quarter-deck and opened the chest under the high seat. He took
many sharp swords from it and handed them out. But when he reached down
with his right hand, his men noticed that blood was running out from
under his mail sleeve. No one knew where he was wounded.</p>
<ol start="110" type="1">
<li>Aboard the Long Serpent, the fiercest and bloodiest defense came
from the men stationed just below the quarter-deck and from those
fighting in the bow, for in both places the men were specially selected,
and the ship was high above the water. The men amidships had fallen
first. When only a few of them were left standing around the mast, Earl
Eirik decided to board the Serpent, and fourteen men went with him. They
were attacked by Hyrning, King Olaf’s brother-in-law, and a group of his
followers. The ensuing fight was fierce and ended with Eirik’s retreat
to Ironbeard. Some of the men who accompanied him were killed, others
were wounded. Thord Kolbeinsson says:</li>
</ol>
<p>Blood-showered were the shields</p>
<p>of the helmeted host….</p>
<p>……………………….</p>
<p>Protecting his prince</p>
<p>with his steel sword,</p>
<p>Hyrning gained glory that will last</p>
<p>till the hall of the high hills [heaven] falls.</p>
<p>The fight grew even more bitter and many men died aboard the Long
Serpent. When the defenders of the Serpent had been thinned out, Earl
Eirik decided to board for the second time, but again he met with stiff
resistance. When the men at the bows of the Serpent saw the boarding,
they made their way aft and mounted a desperate defense against the
earl. Aboard the Long Serpent, so many men had fallen that the sides of
the ship were almost undefended. Seeing this, the earl’s men boarded in
large numbers, while all the defenders of the Serpent who were still on
their feet joined the king in the stern. Halldor the Heathen says that
Earl Eirik urged on his men:</p>
<p>Olaf’s men fled aft,</p>
<p>back among the benches,</p>
<p>as Earl Eirik urged on</p>
<p>his battle-tough band.</p>
<p>Eirik the gold-giver’s fleet</p>
<p>encircled King Olaf’s ship;</p>
<p>all around the enemy of the Wends [Olaf]</p>
<p>was the deadly din of battle.</p>
<ol start="111" type="1">
<li>Kolbjorn, the king’s marshal, who was the best and bravest of men,
went up to the quarter-deck and approached King Olaf. The two men were
similarly clothed and armed. Ferocious fighting was still going on in
the stern. As many of Earl Eirik’s men as could find room on the Serpent
had now boarded her, and his ships had surrounded her. So, although the
defenders were both strong and brave, they were too few in number to
resist such a large force, and most of them fell in a very short time.
King Olaf and Kolbjorn both jumped overboard, one on each side of the
ship. The earl’s men had positioned small boats around the Long Serpent
and were killing everyone who took to the water. But when the king
himself jumped overboard, they tried to capture him and take him to Earl
Eirik. King Olaf, however, held his shield above his head and plunged
down into the water. Kolbjorn, on the other hand, thrust his shield
beneath him to protect himself against spears thrown from the
surrounding ships. He landed in the water with his shield beneath him so
that he stayed on the surface long enough for them to seize him and pull
him aboard a boat. Thinking he was the king, they took him to Earl
Eirik, but Eirik recognized him as Kolbjorn and spared his life. At the
same moment, all of King Olaf’s men who were still alive jumped over the
side of the Serpent. Hallfred says that Thorkel Nefja, the king’s
brother, was the last to dive overboard:</li>
</ol>
<p>Heroic Thorkel, happy</p>
<p>to have bloodied his spear in battle,</p>
<p>saw the Long Serpent, the Short Serpent,</p>
<p>and the Crane, empty and adrift.</p>
<p>Then the wise warrior Thorkel,</p>
<p>brave in battle,</p>
<p>firm in fierce fight,</p>
<p>swam away from the Serpent.</p>
<ol start="112" type="1">
<li>As has been written, Earl Sigvald joined King Olaf in Wendland. The
earl had ten ships at Svold, as well as an eleventh aboard which his
wife, Astrid, King Burislaf’s daughter, had her men. When King Olaf
jumped overboard, the whole army raised a shout of triumph. Then Earl
Sigvald and his men put their oars into the water and rowed toward the
battle. Halldor the Heathen says:</li>
</ol>
<p>The Wendish warships came</p>
<p>from afar to the fight.</p>
<p>Then the sharp ax, the shield’s foe,</p>
<p>gaped and grinned with iron-mouth.</p>
<p>There was the clash of swords on the sea,</p>
<p>and ravenous eagles ripped men’s flesh.</p>
<p>The worthy leader of warriors</p>
<p>fought, but many fled.</p>
<p>However, the Wendish longship with Astrid’s men on board rowed
straight back to Wendland. Immediately, a rumor sprang up that Olaf
Tryggvason had struggled out of his mail shirt in the sea and had swum
underwater away from the longships out to the Wendish vessel, which took
him to land. Afterwards, many tales were told about King Olaf’s travels;
Hallfred says this:</p>
<p>Shall I praise a living lord,</p>
<p>or praise the raven’s prey?</p>
<p>Shall I praise the shield-warrior</p>
<p>alive, or lost to death?</p>
<p>Men talk of both as true,</p>
<p>but truth is hard to tell.</p>
<p>Whatever fate befell him,</p>
<p>the warrior was surely wounded.</p>
<p>But, whatever the truth of the matter, King Olaf Tryggvason never
returned to his kingdom in Norway.</p>
