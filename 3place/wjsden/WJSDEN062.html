<h4 id="c-earl-rognvald-kali-in-the-mediterranean-aaaaaaaa">(c) Earl
Rognvald Kali in the Mediterranean AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>In the early 1150s the Earl of Orkney, Rognvald Kali Kolsson,
embarked upon a pilgrimage/crusade to Rome and the Holy Land. Orkneyinga
saga describes an encounter in the Mediterranean between the Orcadian
crusaders and a Muslim vessel called a dromond.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Orkneyinga saga, ed. Finnbogi
Guðmundsson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXIV (Reykjavík, 1965), pp. 222–28.</p>
<ol start="87" type="1">
<li>…One morning, the mist lifted, and the men stood up and looked
around them. They saw two islands but, when they looked again later, one
of the islands had vanished. They told the earl what they had seen.</li>
</ol>
<p>“It can’t have been islands you saw,” he said. “It must have been
ships. The ships that people have out here in this part of the world
look as big as islands; they’re called dromonds. A sea breeze must have
blown up where the one of the dromonds was lying and now it has sailed
away. The people on board must be traveling men of some sort, probably
merchants.”</p>
<p>After that, the earl summoned the bishop and all the captains to a
meeting.</p>
<p>“Lord bishop,” he said, “and Erling my kinsman, I’ve called you here
to ask if you can think of any ruse or strategy for defeating the people
aboard the dromond?”</p>
<p>“Your best plan would be to grapple the bulwark with battle-axes,”
replied the bishop, “but you’ll find it difficult to bring your ships
alongside the dromond because they’ll have sulphur and boiling pitch
that they can shower you with from head to toe. A man as wise as you,
earl, must see how dangerous it would be to expose himself and his men
to such a great risk.”</p>
<p>Then Erling spoke up. “Lord bishop,” he said, “you’re probably right.
Attacking them may well prove futile. But to my way of thinking, if we
get in close to the dromond, and lie broadside to it, most of their
weapons will fall beyond our ship. And if things don’t work out that
way, we can always sail away quickly, for the people on the dromond
aren’t going to chase us.”</p>
<p>“Well said,” declared the earl. “That’s just what I think. Now I want
the captains and crews to be clear about this: every man is to go to his
place and arm himself with his best equipment. Then we’ll attack. If
they turn out to be Christian merchants, we can make peace with them,
but if they’re heathens, as I think they are, then almighty God in his
mercy will give us victory. We’ll give the poor every fiftieth penny of
whatever booty we take.”</p>
<p>At that, the men seized their weapons, put up battle-walls on the
bulwarks of their ships, and made ready as best they could with the
equipment they had. The earl decided where each ship should head. Then
they rowed to the attack as fast as possible.</p>
<ol start="88" type="1">
<li>When the people aboard the dromond saw ships rowing toward them and
realized that they were under attack, they took their fine materials and
valuables and carried them to the sides of the ship. They began shouting
loudly as though goading the earl’s men to approach the dromond. Earl
Rognvald positioned his ship toward the stern of the dromond on the
starboard side; Erling was at the stern, too, but on the port side. Jon
and Aslak lay toward the bow, one on either side of the dromond, while
the others were amidships on the port and starboard sides. All of the
ships lay broadside on. When they came alongside the dromond, it stood
so high out of the water that they could not reach the bulwarks with
their weapons. The crew of the dromond began pouring burning sulphur and
pitch over them, but most of it fell beyond the ships as Erling had
predicted, and so they had no need to shield themselves from it.</li>
</ol>
<p>As they were getting nowhere with their attack, the bishop withdrew
his own ship and two others. They concentrated their archers aboard
these ships and then they moved within range of the dromond and opened
fire. This attack was very effective. The people on board the dromond
were so busy protecting themselves that they paid little attention to
what the Norsemen at the sides of their ship were up to. Earl Rognvald
ordered his men to take their axes and hack at the side of the dromond
where it was least protected by iron-plating, and, when the crews of the
other ships saw what the earl’s men were doing, they followed suit.</p>
<p>Where Erling and his men had come alongside, there was a huge anchor
hanging down from the dromond. Its fluke was hooked over the gunwale and
its shank pointed down toward Erling’s ship. His bowsman, Audun the Red,
was lifted up onto the anchor-stock and he hauled up other men until as
many men as possible were crammed onto the stock. There, far above the
other ax-wielders, they hacked at the planking as hard as they could and
when they had cut a big enough hole, they boarded the dromond. The earl
and his men got into the lower hold, while Erling and his men got into
the upper one, and when both groups were aboard, there was much hard
fighting.</p>
<p>The men on the dromond were Saracens, whom we call Mohammed’s
heretics. There were many black men too, and they put up the strongest
resistance. As Erling was jumping aboard the dromond, he received a
serious neck-wound right at the shoulder. This wound healed so badly
that he carried his head to one side ever after, and that’s why he was
nicknamed Erling Wry-Neck. As soon as the earl and Erling joined forces,
the Saracens retreated before them toward the bows, but the earl’s men
kept pouring onto the ship one after another, pressing the enemy hard as
their numbers increased. The Norsemen noticed that one man aboard the
dromond was taller and handsomer than the others and they thought for
sure that he must be their leader. Earl Rognvald ordered them not to use
weapons against this man if they could take him some other way. So the
Norsemen hemmed him in with their shields and that is how he was
captured. He and a few of his companions were taken aboard the bishop’s
ship, but everyone else was killed. The Norsemen seized lots of money
and many valuables, and when most of the work was done, they sat down
and rested. The earl recited this verse:</p>
<p>Bloody our banners, when the</p>
<p>famous fighter, glorious Erling,</p>
<p>strongest spearman, advanced</p>
<p>victorious against the vessel.</p>
<p>Brave were the warriors who bloodied</p>
<p>sharp swords and spilled enemy</p>
<p>blood from stem to stern,</p>
<p>when we felled the black men’s best.</p>
<p>and this:</p>
<p>Desperate to take the dromond,</p>
<p>warriors stained their swords</p>
<p>early in the action;</p>
<p>this was a slaughter for sure; from the</p>
<p>south northwards, and from the north</p>
<p>to Narbonne, the lady will hear news</p>
<p>of the awful loss of life inflicted</p>
<p>on the heathen by our host.</p>
<p>They talked about what had taken place, and each man recounted his
own version of the events. Then they got into an argument about who had
boarded the dromond first, and they couldn’t agree on this point. Some
of them declared that it was absurd to have several versions of such a
great event. So they agreed that Earl Rognvald should settle the dispute
and that they would all go along with his decision. The earl spoke:</p>
<p>Hell-bent on booty,</p>
<p>Audun the Red rushed</p>
<p>first with fierce courage</p>
<p>aboard the dark dromond;</p>
<p>there we wet our weapons</p>
<p>in black men’s blood;</p>
<p>dark bodies fell to the decks</p>
<p>as the god of men granted.</p>
<p>Then they cleared the dromond, and set it ablaze. When the tall man
they had captured saw this, he started and grew pale and agitated. They
tried to make him talk, but no matter how much they threatened or
cajoled, he didn’t say a word or make a sign. When the dromond was
completely ablaze, they saw something that looked like a burning stream
flowing into the sea. This greatly affected their prisoner. They
concluded that they hadn’t searched carefully enough for treasure and
that metal, either gold or silver, had melted as the fire took hold.</p>
