<h4 id="d-the-battle-of-fimreite-norafjord-1184">(d) The Battle of
Fimreite (Norafjord), 1184</h4>
<p>This battle secured the throne of Norway for King Sverrir
(1145/51–1202). The “Birkibeins” (birch-legs) were the rebellious
supporters of the pretender Sverrir in his struggle against King Magnus
Erlingsson (1156–84), whose supporters were known as the Heklungs. From
Sverrir’s Saga (see doc. 34).</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Sverris saga, ed. Þorleifur
Hauksson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXV (Reykjavík, 2007), pp. 136–44.</p>
<ol start="88" type="1">
<li>…Then King Sverrir ordered his men to take down the awnings and row
the ships into the fjord, close to shore. “I want a cutter to row as
rapidly as possible to Soknadale with orders for our ships there to join
us,” said Sverrir. “Then we’ll row out to meet the enemy. In every ship,
one man from each half-room is to sit at the oar, the second is to row
ashore in a small boat to fetch stones, while the third man, as well as
anyone else who is free, is to get the ships ready and put up the
battle-walls [upward extensions of a ship’s sides].”</li>
</ol>
<p>They carried out the king’s orders and used the nails he had given
them to fasten loops of walrus rope all round the inner surface of the
ships’ sides. Then they fitted supports into the loops and used them to
prop up the battlewalls securely. Everyone was busy now and the
Birkibeins were obviously used to work like this.</p>
<p>When the crew of the cutter rowed up the fjord, they met their
comrades rowing down and they passed on the rumor about King Magnus’s
fleet. The sailors on the longships leapt into action, put their oars
into the water and rowed for all they were worth. As they approached
King Sverrir’s ships, they got into a race and rowed so close to one
another that several oars were broken. At that, the king said, “We have
more serious business on hand than breaking one another’s oars.”</p>
<p>He ordered them to make for the shore and wait there for King Magnus.
Then they brought as many rocks as they wanted out to the ships and
raised up the battle-walls. After that, the king ordered his men to haul
the stern mooring-ropes aboard all the ships. He also ordered them to
turn the ships’ bows to face away from the shore and to place their oars
in the rowing position. The king’s ship lay close to shore and was
nearest to the mouth of the fjord. Then the king ordered his men to arm
themselves and take their places in the rooms….</p>
<p>“We’re not going to lash our ships together,” said King Sverrir. “We
must rely on the height of our ships’ sides and the courage of our
battle-hardened army to gain whatever advantage we can. There’s only one
course of action open to us, and that is to defeat our enemies, for
neither running away nor begging for peace will do us any good. Be
careful with your weapons and don’t throw them at the enemy until you
have to. Look after yourselves first, and one another next! May God
protect us all!”</p>
<p>Then he had the standards raised. Close to their ships, a small
headland jutted out into the sea, almost blocking their view of the
entrance to the fjord. So the king had a cutter row out to watch for
King Magnus’s fleet, but when they had gone only a few strokes from
land, they rowed quickly back and announced that the enemy fleet was
heading toward them. Immediately, the trumpet was sounded and the
Birkibeins started rowing all their ships to the attack, raising a war
cry as they went. Thord, brother of Fingeir, was steersman on the
Mariasud.</p>
<ol start="89" type="1">
<li>King Magnus now sailed into the fjord in search of the Birkibeins.
When he and his men realized that the fleets were not far apart, they
lowered their sails and went forward under oars, staying close together
as they advanced….</li>
</ol>
<p>King Magnus addressed his men: “These large merchant ships of ours
are not designed for rowing. We shall lash them together between Orm’s
ship and mine. Then we’ll head for King Sverrir’s big ship and attach
our ships to it. I don’t want the ships separated until either we clear
theirs of men or they clear ours….”</p>
<p>Then King Magnus’s brother, Orm, said, “My lord, my advice is that we
should attack the small ships first because they won’t offer much
resistance, but I think it will be hard to overcome the big ship as long
as they have plenty of men and ships to support it.”</p>
<p>King Magnus replied, “It seems to me that all the ships will be taken
if the big ship is taken.” The king’s words were decisive. The four
biggest ships were lashed together and the king’s ship sailed closest to
the southern shore of the fjord….</p>
<ol start="91" type="1">
<li>Now it is time to recount some of the events which took place in the
encounter between the two kings. We have already touched on this, and
now the story returns to the Birkibeins who (as previously mentioned)
rowed out from the land as soon as they saw King Magnus’s fleet heading
their way. In front of this fleet they saw what looked like heavy rain,
the sort of shower that is seen at sea in calm weather. This shower,
which passed quickly overhead, was, in fact, a hail of arrows; shields
had to be used against them.</li>
</ol>
<p>They tried to bring the Mariasud about to face the enemy, but her
turning circle was so wide that the ships crashed together before she
could complete the turn. Magnus’s ships collided with the side of the
Mariasud, striking her near the bow with their prows. The Skeggi [one of
Magnus’s ships] lay at the Mariasud’s forward pump-room, and the other
ships were lined up side by side from there to the prow.</p>
<p>A fierce battle followed. King Magnus’s men fought with great vigor,
but the Birkibeins hung back defensively. In the meantime, the ships
were all drifting toward the shore together, coming very close to the
land. At first, the Birkibeins were unable to go on the offensive
because the Mariasud lay between them and King Magnus’s ships. So King
Sverrir and one other man leapt aboard a boat and rowed out to his son
Eirik’s ship. Sverrir called out to them that their behavior was weak
and unmanly. He ordered them to row around the big ship and head toward
the smaller enemy ships and see how they got on there. The king rowed
among his ships, encouraging his men and telling them where to attack.
Heartened by the king’s words, his men attacked bravely and put up a
fierce fight, but their enemies gave as good as they got. Both sides let
fly with all the weapons they had.</p>
<p>As the king rowed back to his ship, an arrow struck the prow of the
boat just above his head; immediately afterwards, another arrow hit the
side of the boat above his knees. The king sat still and didn’t flinch.
His companion said, “Dangerous shots, my lord.”</p>
<p>“They come as near as God wills,” replied the king.</p>
<p>Then the king realized that the hail of weapons and stones falling on
the Mariasud was so dense that he couldn’t get aboard again, and so he
rowed away toward the land. Munan Gautsson [a Heklung] and his men also
steered their ship to land. They leapt ashore and fetched great stones
to hurl at the Mariasud. They bombarded her from the rowing space at the
stern all the way forward to the pump room, and the men in those areas
endured terrible slaughter. It was the men stationed in the bow,
however, who were most exposed to the attack and the shower of weapons.
They told one another that it was now time to pay the king for their
mead and their fine clothing.</p>
<p>The men at the stern ordered the starboard oarsmen to row forward. By
doing so, they pulled the Mariasud forward till the Skeggi was level
with the aft pump-room. Now the men on the port side and in the rowing
place at the stern had their hands full because fourteen ships lay along
one side of the Mariasud. Then the Heklungs [King Magnus’s men] launched
missiles, even halberds and blocks of whetstone that they had brought
west from Skida; these were very dangerous weapons. They also threw
pikes and short swords, but they couldn’t get close enough for
hand-to-hand fighting. The Birkibeins took cover since they could do
nothing else. Even so, many of them died and nearly all of them were
wounded by weapons and rocks. They were so worn out and had taken such a
beating that some men died of exhaustion even though they were just
slightly wounded, or not wounded at all. The Heklungs hung back from
boarding the Mariasud because they had difficulty in attacking over the
prows of their own ships. If they had lain broadside to the Mariasud,
then one side would have boarded the other much sooner.</p>
<ol start="92" type="1">
<li>Now, anyone listening to this story will find its account of the end
of the battle improbable. For now the tale goes on to recount what
(apart from good luck) caused the victory to take such an unlikely
turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the story said earlier, King Sverrir’s son, Eirik, rowed around
the big ship with the thirteen ships not engaged in the fight. He made
for the thirteen of the Heklungs’ ships that were furthest from the
shore and were not lying next to the Mariasud. The ships met broadside
on and a fierce battle broke out. The Birkibeins had larger ships and
more men and they mounted a hard and vigorous attack. However, the
Heklungs put up a stubborn resistance and defended themselves with such
spirit that no one could tell whether the battle would be decided by
this fight or by the clearing of the Mariasud. The men of Sogn had a
flotilla of boats within firing range of the Birkibeins and shot at
them.</p>
<p>Eirik the king’s son brought his ship broadside against the outermost
of the ships that were lashed together. His ship had much higher sides,
and there was heavy fighting, for the Heklungs resisted strongly.
However, after a period of hand-to-hand fighting, they were overwhelmed
by numbers. Some of them died and others abandoned their half-rooms.</p>
<p>Then the Birkibeins set about boarding the enemy ship. Eirik’s
standardbearer, a man called Benedikt, went first and was followed by
the men from the bow. Seeing this, the Heklungs launched a violent
attack and killed Benedikt and most of the boarding party. The rest were
driven back. Then the king’s son encouraged his men to attempt a second
boarding. This time, they recaptured their standard and attacked so
fiercely that the Heklungs retreated and leapt aboard the nearest ship,
with the Birkibeins hard on their heels. What happened next is what
always happens in battle, when men are overcome by panic or the desire
for flight; they are seldom anxious to face the enemy a second time,
even if they resisted courageously at first. The Heklungs put up less of
a fight on the second ship than on the first and soon they all retreated
from that ship to the next. And so they fled from one ship to another
with the Birkibeins in pursuit, uttering war-cries, and shouting
encouragement to their comrades. They cut down and killed everyone in
their path.</p>
<p>As the crowd of fleeing men surged onto the big ships, people jumped
overboard from King Magnus’s ship since it was closest to shore. But the
other four large ships sank under the weight of so many men. These were
the ships commanded by Orm, Asbjarn, and Gesta-Flei.</p>
<ol start="93" type="1">
<li>King Sverrir was ashore and when he saw these decisive events, he
went down to his boat with Bishop Hroi’s son, Peter. At that moment some
men rowed up in a cutter, intending to come ashore. The king called out
to them, “Go back! Don’t you see they’re running away?”</li>
</ol>
<p>The men turned back, and seeing the scene just described, they dipped
their oars into the water and rowed off down the fjord. “Did you know
these men?” asked Peter. “Why did you say what you did?”</p>
<p>“I would have said the same thing whoever they were,” replied King
Sverrir.</p>
<p>Then the king went straight to his ship and walked aft to the
quarterdeck. There he began to sing the Kyrie to celebrate his victory,
and all his men joined in. But King Magnus and all his men jumped from
his ship and a whole host of them perished there. The Birkibeins hurried
ashore to intercept anyone who tried to reach land. Only a handful of
men made it, though a few cutters rowed down the fjord and escaped. The
Birkibeins rowed out in small boats. They killed some of the men who
were swimming, but spared others. All those who managed to reach King
Sverrir were given quarter; and the commanders of Sverrir’s ships also
gave quarter to their relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Chapter Seven</p>
<hr />
<p>“Sudden and Unforeseen Attacks of Northmen”</p>
<p>As the eighth century waned, Europe began to experience what one
contemporary described as “sudden and unforeseen attacks of Northmen.”
The ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle describes what may be the
earliest recorded raids in its entry for 789, when three ships of
Northmen landed in the south of England and killed a king’s officer, and
when Lindisfarne was sacked on 8 June 793. Irish annals recorded the
first appearance of the Northmen in the islands off the west coast of
Britain and in Ireland from 795, and in 799 there is the first reference
to Viking activity off the Continent. By the 830s and 840s, Viking
fleets had penetrated far inland up waterways such as the Shannon, the
Loire, the Seine, and the Rhine. By the mid-840s and 850s some intrepid
leaders were even reaching the Mediterranean and the Rhône River. Such
sea-borne raids instilled fear in contemporaries and have inspired
modern historians to distinguish a “First Viking Age” or a period of
“Reconnaissance” characterized by raiding and plundering, lasting from
the 790s until the middle of the ninth century, when raiding intensified
and eventually gave way to over-wintering and settlement (see chapter
8).</p>
