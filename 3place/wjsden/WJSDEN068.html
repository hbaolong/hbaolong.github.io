<h4 id="viking-raids-on-ireland-795842">42. Viking Raids on Ireland,
795–842</h4>
<p>The Annals of Ulster is one of the most important sources of early
Irish history. It is a record of medieval Irish affairs, covering the
period from the fifth to the early sixteenth centuries, surviving in two
late manuscripts. The annals drew on earlier sources, and by the Viking
period they were contemporary with the events they chronicle; they have
been described as “substantially accurate accounts” of Viking activity,
though this is debated. The chronology of the annals is off by one year
for the section reproduced here; corrected dates are provided in
parentheses. Because of limited space, only entries pertaining to the
Vikings are reproduced here; the culling of the text in this manner has
the effect of removing much contextual material that illustrates, among
other things, that Irish society was extremely violent before the
arrival of the Vikings.</p>
