Harald Finehair and the Unification of Norway AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Harald Hárfagri (Finehair) is often credited with the unification of
Norway. The most detailed account of his life and reign is his saga in
Snorri Sturluson’s Heimskringla, although he is mentioned in many other
Icelandic sagas. Snorri describes his campaigns against a variety of
other Norwegian rulers, culminating in his great victory at Hafrsfjorðr
(Havsfjord). The dates of his reign are murky and controversial. His
accession is estimated at 860–880, his victory at Havsfjord at 885–890,
and his death at 930–940. Whatever he had accomplished during his
lifetime did not survive his death, when his numerous sons (perhaps as
many as twenty!) fell to feuding over their father’s revenues and title
to the kingship. Accordingly, it is the Christianizing kings at the end
of the tenth century and start of the eleventh (see docs. 90 and 92) who
are credited with completing the unification of Norway.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Haralds saga
ins Hágrfara, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 1, pp. 84–122.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>…King Harald was a handsome man, very tall and strong, as well as
intelligent and brave. He succeeded his father as king when he was ten
years old and, at this time, his maternal uncle, Guthorm, assumed
leadership of the royal guard and made himself responsible for governing
the kingdom and commanding the army.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the death of Halfdan the Black, many chieftains began
encroaching on the kingdom he had left behind. First there was King
Gandalf and the brothers Hogni and Frodi, the sons of King Eystein of
Hedmark. Next there was Hogni Karuson, who overran large parts of
Ringarik. Then, Haki Gandalfsson set out for Vestfold with three hundred
men; he took the high road across several valleys, intending to take
King Harald by surprise. Meanwhile, King Gandalf waited at Londir
[Vesteroy?] with his army, planning to move it across the fjord to
Vestfold. As soon as Guthorm Hertogi [commander] got wind of all this,
he mustered his army, and he and King Harald moved up country to
confront Haki. They encountered one another in a valley; a great battle
took place, and King Harald was victorious. King Haki and many of his
men were killed there, and ever since, the valley has been known as
Haki’s Dale.</p>
<p>After that, Guthorm and King Harald turned back to face King Gandalf
who had arrived in Vestfold. The two sides advanced against one another,
and, when they met, there was a fierce battle. King Gandalf lost most of
his army, so he fled and returned to his kingdom.</p>
<p>When the sons of King Eystein of Hedmark heard about this, they
concluded that they too would soon have a fight on their hands. So they
sent word to Hogni Karuson and Hersir Gudbrand and set up a meeting at
Ringsaker in Hedmark.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>After these battles, King Harald and Guthorm Hertogi assembled
their available forces and made for Uppland, traveling mainly by forest
paths. They found out where the Uppland kings had arranged to meet and
arrived there in the middle of the night. Before the sentries were aware
of what was happening, the king’s army had reached the houses where
Hogni Karuson and Guthbrand were sleeping and set them alight. Hogni and
Frodi got out with their men and defended themselves for a while but
eventually they were both killed. With the deaths of these four kings,
and through the might and prowess of his kinsman Guthorm, King Harald
had now gained possession of Ringarik, Hedmark, Gudbrand’s Dale,
Hadeland, Toten, Romarik, and the whole of north Vingulmark. King Harald
and Guthorm Hertogi were still at war with King Gandalf, but when King
Gandalf died in the final battle, the fighting ended and King Harald
gained possession of the kingdom as far south as the Raum
River.</p></li>
<li><p>King Harald sent envoys to a maid called Gyda, the daughter of
Eirik, King of Hordaland, who was being brought up in the house of a
rich landowner in Valdres. Harald wanted her as his mistress because she
was a very beautiful and high-spirited girl. When the envoys arrived,
they delivered their message to the young woman, and she replied to the
effect that she wouldn’t waste her maidenhood on a king who ruled only a
couple of provinces.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“I think it’s extraordinary,” she said, “that there is no king with
enough ambition to conquer Norway and make himself sole ruler of the
country, like King Gorm in Denmark and Eirik at Uppsala [in
Sweden].”</p>
<p>The envoys thought that she answered arrogantly, and asked her what
she meant by such an answer, adding that Harald was a powerful king, and
a worthy match for her. But though she hadn’t given them the sort of
answer they wanted, they recognized that there was no immediate
possibility of carrying her off against her will, so they prepared for
the return journey. When they were ready and people were seeing them
off, she told the envoys to take this message to King Harald: she would
agree to be his lawful wife only if, for her sake, he would first
conquer the whole of Norway and rule there autonomously, like King Eirik
in Sweden, or King Gorm in Denmark. “For only then, I think, could he be
called a sovereign,” she said.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The envoys made their way back to King Harald and told him what the
girl had said. They told him too that she was impudent and foolish and
that the king would be completely justified in sending a large force to
carry her off in disgrace. King Harald replied that the girl had neither
said nor done anything to merit punishment but, instead, deserved thanks
for her words.</li>
</ol>
<p>“She has reminded me of something which, strange to say, I haven’t
thought about before now,” he said. Then he added, “I call on God, who
created me and who rules the universe to witness this solemn oath: I
shall neither cut nor comb my hair until I gain possession of the whole
of Norway—with all its taxes and revenues—and become sole ruler there,
or die trying.”</p>
<p>Guthorm Hertogi praised his vow, and said that it was a king’s duty
to keep his word.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>After that, Harald and Guthorm mustered a large army and made for
Uppland. Then they went north through the Dales, and north again over
Dovrefjell [a mountain range]. Whenever the king came down into a
settlement, he had the men slaughtered and the buildings burned, and
when news of this spread, everyone who could, fled. Some of them went to
Orkadal, some to Gaulardal, and some took to the forests. Others begged
for mercy and this was granted to everyone who came to the king and
swore allegiance to him.</li>
</ol>
<p>King Harald and his uncle Guthorm met no resistance until they
reached Orkadal where an army had been mobilized against them. Their
first battle was against a king called Gryting and King Harald won this
battle. Gryting was captured, and a large part of his army was killed.
So he submitted to Harald and swore allegiance to him. Then the whole
population of Orkadal province submitted to King Harald and became his
subjects.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Wherever King Harald gained control, he imposed a law giving himself
ownership of all ancestral properties and forcing all landholders, both
great and small, to pay him rent. Over every province, he placed an earl
whose duty it was to make legal decisions and to apply the law, to levy
fines and to collect rents. Each earl was to have a third of the taxes
and dues for his living-costs and expenses. He was also to have four or
more hersirs under him, each of whom was to have an allowance of twenty
marks. The earls were required to provide sixty men each for the royal
army; the hersirs supplied twenty men each.</li>
</ol>
<p>King Harald increased taxes and land-rents so much that his earls
became more powerful than the former kings had been. When this became
known throughout Trondheim, many influential men sought out King Harald
and entered his service.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>History tells us that Earl Hakon Grjotgardsson came from Yrjar [now
Ørland] with a large army to support King Harald. After that, King
Harald advanced into Gaulardal where he fought and killed two kings, and
took possession of their territories, Gaulardal and the Strinda
district. Harald put Earl Hakon in charge of the Strinda district.</li>
</ol>
<p>King Harald went next to Stjordal where he fought and won a third
battle and annexed that district. After this, the people of the Inner
Trondheim district assembled for battle. Four kings were there with
their armies. They were the kings of Verdal, Skaun, Sparby, and Lower
Eyin. The king of Lower Eyin also ruled Eynafylki. These four kings
advanced against King Harald with their army. Harald engaged them in
battle and won, killing some of them and putting others to flight. In
all, King Harald fought eight or more battles in the Trondheim district
and, with the fall of the eight kings, he took over the whole
Trondelag….</p>
<ol start="18" type="1">
<li>News spread from the south that the people of Hordaland, Rogaland,
Agder, and Thilir had united in an armed uprising and were assembling
ships, weapons, and large numbers of men. The leaders of the revolt were
King Eirik of Hordaland; Sulki, King of Rogaland; his brother Earl Soti;
Kjotvi the Wealthy, King of Agder; his son, Thorir Haklang; and Hroald
Hryg and Hadd the Hard, two brothers from Telemark.</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as King Harald heard this news, he assembled his army and
prepared it for battle. Then he launched his ships and sailed south
along the coast with many men from every district. When King Harald had
got as far south as Stad, King Eirik heard about his approach. He
mustered all the troops he could and headed south to meet the forces
that he knew were coming from the east to support him. The entire fleet
met to the north of Jadar and steered into Hafrsfjord, where King Harald
was already waiting with his forces. Fierce fighting broke out. There
was a long, hard battle but, in the end, King Harald was victorious, and
King Eirik, King Sulki and his brother, Earl Soti, were killed. King
Harald’s own ship had been attacked by Thorir Haklang. Thorir was a
fierce berserker and the fighting was frenzied until he was killed.
After that, his ship was completely cleared of men. Meanwhile King
Kjotvi fled to an island that offered natural protection, and after
that, their entire army fled. Some of them escaped by ship; others leapt
ashore and fled south across Jadar. As Hornklofi puts it:</p>
<p>Have you heard</p>
<p>how in Hafrsfjord</p>
<p>a king of noble kin fought</p>
<p>Kjotvi the wealthy king?</p>
<p>Keen for conflict, his</p>
<p>fleet set forth from the east,</p>
<p>great figure-heads gaping,</p>
<p>prows covered with carving.</p>
<p>Massed aboard were men</p>
<p>with white shields and sharp</p>
<p>spears—weapons from the west–</p>
<p>and splendid Frankish swords;</p>
<p>berserkers bellowed,</p>
<p>—Gunnr was with them—</p>
<p>wearers of wolfskins howled,</p>
<p>shook their sharp spears.</p>
<p>They put their prowess to the</p>
<p>test, but he taught them to turn</p>
<p>and run, the Norse ruler</p>
<p>who has his home at Utstein;</p>
<p>he steered out his sea-steeds [ships],</p>
<p>when the strife started;</p>
<p>shields bore thudding blows</p>
<p>ere Haklang lost his life.</p>
<p>Kjotvi the bull-necked king grew</p>
<p>weary of war with Tanglehair</p>
<p>for lordship of the land,</p>
<p>hoped for a haven on the isle;</p>
<p>with asses in the air,</p>
<p>and heads in the hold,</p>
<p>the casualties crept under</p>
<p>rowers’ benches for refuge.</p>
<p>Their shields shining</p>
<p>on backs beaten</p>
<p>by a rain of rocks</p>
<p>the wiser warriors fled;</p>
<p>the enemy escaped eastward,</p>
<p>hastened home over Jadar,</p>
<p>back from battle at Hafrsfjord,</p>
<p>their minds on mead-drinking.</p>
<ol start="19" type="1">
<li><p>After the battle of Hafrsfjord [885–890], King Harald faced no
more opposition in Norway. All of his most powerful enemies were dead or
had fled abroad. They had fled in large numbers, for vast areas of
uninhabited countryside were settled at this time. Among these areas
were Jämtland and Hälsingland, though both already had a sprinkling of
Norse settlers. During this period of unrest, when King Harald was
bringing Norway under his control, outlying places such as the Faeroes
and Iceland were discovered and settled. There was a large exodus to the
Shetlands too. Many Norwegian chieftains fled as outlaws from King
Harald, and took to the Viking life in the west. They spent the winters
in the Orkneys and Shetlands, and in summer they raided Norway,
inflicting a great deal of damage on the country. Many other chieftains
submitted to King Harald, entered his service, and helped him run the
country.</p></li>
<li><p>King Harald had now become the sole ruler of Norway. It was then
that he remembered what that proud young lady had said to him. So he
sent some men to fetch her and took her to live with him. Their children
were Alof (the eldest), Hroerek, Sigtrygg, Frodi, and Thorgils.</p></li>
<li><p>After King Harald had conquered the whole of the country, he
attended a banquet in Møre at the house of Earl Rognvald. He took a bath
there and had his hair cut and combed for the first time in ten years.
Earl Rognvald himself did the cutting. Harald’s nickname had been
Tanglehair, but now Earl Rognvald renamed him Finehair. Everyone who saw
him thought that this was a very fitting name because his hair was both
abundant and beautiful [see doc. 4].</p></li>
