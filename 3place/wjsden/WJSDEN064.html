<h4 id="on-the-causes-of-the-viking-expansion-aaaaaaaa">38. On the
Causes of the Viking Expansion AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Dudo, dean of St. Quentin (d. before 1027), wrote his De moribus et
actis primorum Normanniae ducum (On the Customs and Deeds of the First
Dukes of Normandy) at the behest of Count Richard I (d. 996). The work
was composed between about 996 and 1015 and covered events between the
850s and the death of Count Richard. The first book includes one of the
few attempts by a medieval writer to explain the sudden advent of the
Northmen as anything other than the wrath of God. Modern scholarship is
quite skeptical about the historical value of the work, but it is
important as an early formulation of the Norman origin myth.</p>
<p>Source: trans. E. Christiansen, Dudo of St. Quentin, History of the
Normans (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 1998), pp. 15–17.</p>
<p>1.1 Now the cosmographers who have surveyed the world’s whole mass,
and have cunningly measured the perimeter and the surface of the land,
have taken a bearing by the cardinal points of the four-cornered sky,
and have divided the whole of the land, hedged round on all sides by the
endless girdle of Ocean, into three parts; and these parts are reckoned
to be Asia, Europe, and Africa. Of these, Europe is threaded by the
courses of very many rivers, and marked out into various provinces, and
divided up into countries within its “separating boundary.” And of
these, the most spacious and the most affluent of all, owing to the many
uncountable throngs of its people, is called Germany. Within which, the
river Hister rises at the top of mount Abnoba, grows vastly bigger fed
by sixty tributaries, and wanders boisterously from the south to the
east (having separated Germany from Scythia) up to the point where it is
received into the Scythian Sea; it is usually called the Danube.</p>
<p>Spread out within the huge space between the Danube and the edge of
the Scythian Sea, there dwell savage and barbarous peoples, which are
said to have sprung forth in various different ways from the island of
Scanza [Scandinavia], hemmed in on both sides by the Ocean, like a swarm
of bees from a hive, or like a sword from a scabbard; as barbarians
will. For there lies the region of the great multitudes of Alania, the
exceedingly fertile site of Dacia, and the far-extended reaches of
Getia. Of which, Dacia stands in the middle, looking like a crown, or
resembling a city fortified by enormous Alps. And wild peoples, warlike
and “foreboding Mars” inhabit this extensive corner; that is, the Getae
(also called Goths), the Sarmatians, and the Amacsobii, the Tragoditae,
and the Alans, and many other peoples who dwell in and cultivate the
Maeotid Marshes. Now these people burn with too much wanton
lasciviousness, and with singular depravity debauch and mate with as
many women as they please; and so, by mingling together in illicit
couplings, they generate innumerable children.</p>
<p>When these have grown up, they clamor fiercely against their fathers
and their grandfathers, or more frequently against each other, for
shares of property; and, as they are over-many, and the land they
inhabit is not large enough for them to live in, there is a very old
custom by which a multitude of youths is selected by lot and expelled
into the realms of other nations, to win kingdoms for themselves by
fighting, where they can live in uninterrupted peace. That is what the
Getae did, who are also called Goths, after they had laid waste almost
the whole of Europe as far as where they live now.</p>
<p>1.2 Besides, at one time they used to complete their expulsions and
exits by making sacrifices in honor of their god Thor. And to him they
would offer no single beasts, nor herds of cattle, nor “gifts of Father
Liber, nor of Ceres,” but men’s blood, which they deemed to be the most
precious of all holocausts; because him whom a soothsaying priest would
determine beforehand, they struck with one fatal blow on his head, [as
with] a pair of oxen. And then, when the head of the one chosen by lot
had been struck a single blow by each man, he was laid out on the
ground, and they would search for “the tube of the heart” on the
left-hand side; that is, for the aorta. And it was their custom to smear
their own and their followers’ heads with the blood that was drained
out; and then they would quickly hoist the sails of their ships into the
winds, thinking to placate those [winds] by such a procedure, and would
briskly ply the oars of their ships.</p>
<p>But if, on the other hand, the lot they drew was for going out on
horseback, they would raise the martial standards of battle, and so
escape from their own confines and pursue the policy of “falling upon
other nations with” deadly “force.” For they are exiled by fathers,
boldly to batter kings. They are sent away without wealth from their own
people, that they may enrich themselves out of the plenty of foreigners.
They are deprived of their own lands, that they might be settled
undisturbed on those of others. They are expelled as exiles, that they
may be rewarded as warriors. They are thrust out by their own people,
that they may share with aliens. They are separated from their own
nation, that they may rejoice in possessing others. They are abandoned
by their fathers, perhaps never again to be seen by their mothers. The
ferocity of the young men is aroused, and the nations are destroyed. The
native land is liberated, having been purged of its own numerous enemy.
So they lay waste everything which stands in their way. Along the
sea-shores they sail, to win for themselves the despoiling of lands.
What they seize from one kingdom they remove to another. They make for
“peace-protected” ports in order to make a profit from their loot.</p>
