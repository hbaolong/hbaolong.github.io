<h4 id="king-harald-gormsson-and-the-land-spirits">17. King Harald
Gormsson and the Land-Spirits</h4>
<p>Landvættir, Land-Spirits, are guardians of particular places or
countries. The Book of Settlements (Landnámabók) (see doc. 72b) states
that the dragon-prows of ships must be removed close to land for fear of
disturbing these spirits. Egil Skallagrimsson left a scorn-pole
(niðstöng: a pole topped by a horse’s head and inscribed with
threatening runes) in Norway in the hope of upsetting them so badly that
they would drive Eirik Bloodax from his kingdom; within a year, Eirik
was gone, deposed by his brother Hakon. Clearly, these are beings to be
reckoned with, as Harald Gormsson, king of Denmark, discovers in this
passage from Olaf Tryggvason’s Saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Óláfs saga
Tryggvasonar, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 1, pp. 270–72.</p>
<ol start="33" type="1">
<li>Then the king of the Danes decided to sail with his fleet to Iceland
to take revenge for the derision which all the Icelanders had heaped on
him. For a law had been passed in Iceland that there was to be one
lampoon composed about the Danish king for every person in the land. The
reason for this was that an Icelandic ship had been wrecked in Denmark,
and the Danes had seized the entire cargo, calling it flotsam. The man
who was responsible for this was the king’s steward, Birgir, and a
lampoon was composed against both him and the king. This is part of
it:</li>
</ol>
<p>When murderous minded</p>
<p>Harald from the south</p>
<p>mounted the mare, stallion-like,</p>
<p>the Wend-Killer [Harald] became soft as wax;</p>
<p>but the base Birgir</p>
<p>—loathed by the Land-Spirits—</p>
<p>stood mare-like,</p>
<p>ready with his rear.</p>
<p>King Harald ordered a sorcerer to go to Iceland in animal-shape and
find out whatever information he could. He went in the form of a whale
and, when he reached Iceland, he swam west around the north of the
country. He saw that all the mountains and hills were full of
Land-Spirits, some large and some small. When he came to Vapnafjord, he
entered the fjord, intending to go ashore, but a huge dragon came down
the valley, followed by many serpents, toads, and lizards that breathed
poison at him. So he swam away and went west along the coast all the way
to Eyjafjord. When he entered the fjord, there came toward him a bird so
huge that its wings reached to the mountains on either side of the
fjord; with it were many other birds, both large and small. Leaving
there, he continued west along the coast, and then went south to
Breidafjord, which he entered. There, a huge bull came toward him,
wading into the sea and bellowing horribly; a horde of Land-Spirits
followed it. So he left and went south around Reykjaness, intending to
land at Vikarskeid, but there he was accosted by a mountain-giant with
an iron staff in his hand. The giant’s head was higher than the
mountains, and with him were many other giants. From there he headed
east all the way along the coast.</p>
<p>“There was nothing but sands,” he said, “and a harborless coast with
heavy surf offshore; and the sea between Norway and Iceland is so wide
that it’s not possible for longships to cross it.” After that, King
Harald turned his fleet south and went back to Denmark.</p>
