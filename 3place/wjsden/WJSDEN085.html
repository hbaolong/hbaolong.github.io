<h4 id="the-rūs">60. The Rūs</h4>
<p>The Carolingian Annals of St-Bertin (see doc. 47), in its entry for
the year 839, contains the first reference in a European source to the
people called the Rūs, and it links them with Sweden. This excerpt
relates how the Byzantine Emperor Theophilus (829–842) sent envoys to
the emperor Louis the Pious.</p>
<p>Source: trans. Janet L. Nelson, The Annals of St-Bertin (Manchester
and New York: Manchester University Press, 1991), p. 44.</p>
<p>There also came envoys from the Greeks sent by the emperor
Theophilus. They were Theodosius, metropolitan bishop of Chalcedon, and
Theophanus the Spatharius, and they brought gifts worthy for an emperor,
and a letter. The emperor received them with due ceremony on 18 May at
Ingelheim. The purpose of their mission was to confirm the treaty of
peace and perpetual friendship and love between the two emperors and
their subjects…. [Theophilus] also sent with the envoys some men who
said they—meaning their whole people [gens]—were called Russians and had
been sent to him by their king, whose name was the Khagan, for the sake
of friendship, so they claimed. Theophilus requested in his letter that
the emperor in his goodness might grant them safe conducts to travel
through his empire and any help or practical assistance needed to return
home, for the route by which they had reached Constantinople had taken
them through primitive tribes that were very fierce and savage and
Theophilus did not wish them to return that way in case some disaster
befell them. When the emperor investigated more closely the reason for
their coming here, he discovered that they belonged to the people of the
Swedes. He suspected that they had really been sent as spies to this
kingdom of ours rather than as seekers of our friendship, so he decided
to keep them with him until he could find out for certain whether or not
they had come in good faith. He lost no time in sending a letter to
Theophilus through the same envoys to tell him all this, and to add that
he had received them willingly for the sake of his friendship with
Theophilus and that if they were found to be genuine, he would supply
them with means to return to their fatherland without any risk of danger
and send them home with every assistance, but if not, he would send them
with envoys of ours back to Theophilus for him to deal with as he might
think fit.</p>
