<h4 id="rūs-expeditions-to-the-middle-east">66. Rūs Expeditions to the
Middle East</h4>
<p>Among the otherwise unknown sources incorporated into the historical
compilation of the Ottoman writer Ahmad b. Lutfullāh (d. 1702) is an
anonymous local history, originally composed in the late eleventh
century, of three Muslim lands in the eastern Caucasus, in what today
roughly corresponds to Azerbaijan: al-Bāb (Bāb al-Abwāb or Darband);
Sharvān, north of the Kur River; and Arrān, south of the Kur. On the
frontiers of the Islamic world, the northern neighbors of these regions
included, from the 960s, the Rūs. The first reference to the Rūs in this
text occurs in the chapter on al-Bāb under the dates 377/987, with
further episodes related in 379/989, 421/1030, and 423/1032.</p>
<p>Source: trans. V. Minorsky, A History of Sharvān and Darband in the
10th–11th Centuries (Cambridge: Heffer andandandand Sons, 1958),
pp. 31–32, 45, 47.</p>
<p>Of the Kings of Sharvān and Bāb al-Abwāb in Two Sections</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li><p>…Later in the same year [1030] the Rūs entered Sharvān and the
sharvanshah Minūchir met them near Bākūya [Baku]. Many of the
Sharvanians were killed and Ahmād b. Khāsskīn, one of their notables,
lost his life. Then the Rūs went up to the river Kurr and Minuchihr
closed the Araxes [al-Rass] in order to stop their progress, but they
drowned a party of Muslims. Later the lord of Janza [Ganja] Mūsā b. Fadl
made them disembark. He gave them much money and took them to Baylaqān,
whose inhabitants had revolted against him. With the help of the Rūs he
captured Baylaqān and seized and killed his brother ’Askariya. Then the
Rūs quitted Arrān for Rum [probably the western parts of the Caucasus
controlled by Byzantium] and thence proceeded to their own
country.</p></li>
<li><p>[Amir Ahmad] was succeeded by his son Maymūn b. Ahmad b. ’Abd
al-Malik [as ruler of al-Bāb]. He remained in the citadel where his
father used to stay, but then was brought down and imprisoned in the
“government building” and the inhabitants began to dismantle the middle
(transverse) wall of the citadel. The time between its construction and
destruction was seven years and one month. Amir Maymūn remained in the
government building as a prisoner and all the power was in the hands of
the “chiefs.”…</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The amir Maymūn secretly sought help from the Rūs against the
“chiefs” and in 377/987 the Rūs arrived in eighteen ships. At first they
sent one single ship to see whether the amir was eager to employ them.
When they brought the amir out of (his confinement), the people of
al-Bāb in a joint effort massacred the Rūs to the last man and the
remaining ships sailed on to Masqat and plundered it. Thence they
proceeded further to Sharvān and Mūqān and to the old river.</p>
<p>In 378/988 the amir Maymūn (re-)built the citadel of al-Bāb and
fortified himself in it.</p>
<p>In 379/989 the disturbance of Mūsā al-Tūzī, the preacher from Gīlān,
broke out in al-Bāb. This man arrived from Gīlān in the town of al-Bāb,
convened a meeting at the cathedral mosque and over 1,000 men made
penitence before him. With them he went to the Tower of the Vault and
amir Maymūn also took a vow not to drink (wine). Matters went on in such
a way that the preacher got control of all government affairs. He
requested the amir to surrender his Rūs ghulāms [armed retainers] to him
so that he might offer them Islam, or kill them. As the amir refused to
do so, disturbances broke out and in 380/990 the amir fortified himself
in the citadel against the preacher. Tūzī and the people of al-Bāb
besieged him there for twenty-eight days and matters came to such a pass
that he asked the preacher for safe-conduct, [on condition] that he
should surrender the citadel to him and himself, with his ghulāms,
depart for Tabarsarān….</p>
<ol start="38" type="1">
<li>…In 423/1032 the amir Mansūr with the ghāzīs of the Islamic
“Centres” led a great expedition. This was because the Rūs had raided
the territories of Sharvan, ruined and plundered them, and murdered or
made prisoner a great mass of the inhabitants. As they were returning,
their hands full of booty and captives, the ghāzīs of al-Bāb and the
Marches, with the amir Mansūr at their head, occupied the defiles and
the roads and put them to the sword so that few escaped. They took from
their hands all the booty, animate and inanimate, which they had
captured in Sharvan. Then the Rūs and the Alāns [returned] with the
intention of revenge. They gathered together and jointly set off in the
direction of al-Bāb and the Marches. First of all, in 424/1033 they
moved to al-Karakh where there was only a small group [of warriors] with
Khusrau and Haytham b. Maymūn al-Bā’ī (?) chief of the tanners. And [the
latter?] fought (them) with the help of the people of Karakh, and God
let victory descend on the Muslims and they wrought great havoc among
the Alāns and the Rūs. The lord of the Alāns was beaten off from the
gate of Karakh, and the infidels’ greed for these Islamic “Centres” was
extinguished absolutely….</li>
