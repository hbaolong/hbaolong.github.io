<h4 id="skallagrims-landtake-in-iceland">73. Skallagrim’s Landtake in
Iceland</h4>
<p>In Egil’s Saga, the hero’s father, Skallagrim, and grandfather,
Kveld-Ulf, emigrate to Iceland from Norway to escape the tyrannical rule
of King Harald Finehair. Chapters 27 to 29 of the saga provide a glimpse
into the nature of landtaking and the natural resources available to
early settlers in Iceland.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar,
ed. Sigurður Nordal, Íslenzk fornrit II (Reykjavík, 1933),
pp. 70–76.</p>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li>…But when they got further out to sea, Kveld-Ulf’s illness worsened
until he was close to death. Then he called his crewmen together and
told them that he thought it likely they would soon part company. “I
have never been sick in my life,” he said, “and I’m probably going to
die. If that happens, make a coffin for me and throw me overboard.
Things won’t turn out as I’d anticipated if I don’t reach Iceland and
settle there. When you see my son, Skallagrim, give him my regards and
tell him that if he reaches Iceland, and I’m there before him (unlikely
as that may seem), he’s to set up house as close as possible to the
place where I came ashore.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Shortly afterwards, Kveld-Ulf died and his crew did as he had told
them. They put him in a coffin and threw him overboard.</p>
<p>One of the crew was a wealthy man of good family called Grim. He was
the son of Thorir and the grandson of Ketil the Keel-Traveler. Grim was
an old friend of Kveld-Ulf and Skallagrim and had gone on expeditions
with them and with Thorolf; for this reason he had incurred the king’s
wrath. After Kveld-Ulf’s death, he took over the running of the ship.
When they reached Iceland, they approached the land from the south. Then
they sailed west along the coast because they’d heard that Ingolf had
settled there.</p>
<p>When they rounded Reykjaness, they saw a fjord opening in front of
them and they steered both ships into it. Then a storm blew up, with
driving rain and fog, and the ships were separated. Grim and his men
sailed up Borgarfjord past all the rocks and anchored there until the
wind dropped and the weather brightened. They waited for high tide and
brought their ship to the mouth of a river called the Gufa. After
hauling the ship as far upstream as possible, they unloaded their cargo
and settled there for the first winter. They explored the land along the
coast in both directions, and before they had gone far, they came upon
an inlet where Kveld-Ulf’s coffin had drifted ashore. They carried the
coffin over to the headland where they laid it down and covered it with
rocks.</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>Where Skallagrim came ashore, a large headland stretches out into
the sea, with a narrow isthmus on the landward side. They unloaded the
cargo there and called the place Knarrarness [Shipsness]. Exploring the
large stretch of country between the mountains and the shore, Skallagrim
found extensive moorlands and wide forests. Both the seal-hunting and
the fishing were excellent. When they explored southwards along the
coast, they came to a large fjord. They turned into the fjord and kept
walking up it until, to their great joy, they came across their
companions, Grim from Halogaland and his crewmen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grim and his men told Skallagrim that Kveld-Ulf had come ashore there
and that they had buried him. They led Skallagrim to the grave, and he
thought that the locality would be a good place to build a homestead.
Then Grim went back to his crew and the two groups spent the winter
where they had come ashore.</p>
<p>Skallagrim took the land between the mountains and the sea: all of
Myrar [Moorland] district, west as far as Selalon [Seal Inlet], north to
Borgarhraun [Borgar Lava Field], and south to Hafnar Fells; that whole
area is divided up by rivers flowing to the sea. The following spring,
he moved his ship south to the fjord, and entered the inlet closest to
where Kveld-Ulf had come ashore. There Skallagrim established a farm,
and called it Borg. The fjord he named Borgarfjord and the surrounding
district was called after it. He gave Grim from Halogaland a farm to the
south of Borgarfjord; it was called Hvanneyri. Nearby a narrow inlet cut
into the land. They found lots of ducks there and so they called the
place Andakil [Duck Inlet] and the river flowing into the sea there they
named Andakilsa [Duck River]. Grim’s land extended from Andakilsa up to
Grimsa [Grim’s River].</p>
<p>That spring, when Skallagrim was having his cattle driven along the
coast, he and his men came to a small headland where they caught swans
and so they called the place Alptaness [Swans’ Ness].</p>
<p>Skallagrim distributed land to his crew. Ani was given the land
between Langa river and Hafs Creek and he lived at Anabrekka; his son
was Onund Sjoni [Keen-Sighted]. Grimolf settled first at Grimolfsstead,
and the meadow and stream there are named after him (Grimolsfit and
Grimolfsloek). Grim, his son, settled south of the fjord and Grim’s son,
Grimar, made his home at Grimarstead. Grani settled at Granastead on
Digraness. Thorbjorn Krum and Thord Beigaldi got land along the Gufa
River. Thorbjorn settled at Krum Hills, and Thord at Beigaldi. The land
above Einkunnir as far west as the river Langa was given to Thorir Thurs
[the Giant] and his brothers. Thorir Thurs made his home at Thursstead
and later on his daughter, Thordis Stang [the Thin], settled at
Stangarholt. Thorgeir lived at Jarthlangsstead.</p>
<p>Skallagrim explored the whole district. First, he traveled right to
the head of Borgarfjord. Then he and his companions followed the west
bank of the river they called Hvita, or White River, because they had
never seen water that flowed from a glacier before and they were
astonished by the color. They carried on along the Hvita until they
reached a river that flowed down from the hills to the north. They named
this river the Northra and followed it till they came to a smaller
river, which they crossed. Proceeding along the Northra, they soon saw
that the small river flowed from a gorge, so they called it the Gljufra,
or Gorge River. Then they crossed the Northra, returned to the Hvita and
followed the Hvita upstream. Shortly afterwards, another river crossed
their path and flowed into the Hvita. This river they named the Thvera,
or Cross River. They noticed that every river was full of fish. After
this, they went back to Borg.</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>Skallagrim was a very hard worker. He always had numerous men in his
household, and they had to collect large amounts of local produce to
feed themselves, because they didn’t have enough livestock at first to
meet the needs of so many people. What animals he had fended for
themselves in the woods over the winter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Skallagrim was an excellent shipbuilder and there was plenty of
driftwood west of Myrar. He established a farm and built another
dwelling at Alptaness and from there his men rowed out to catch fish,
hunt seals, and gather eggs, all of which were plentiful. They also
brought him great quantities of driftwood. Whales were grounded here in
large numbers and could be shot at will; and all the wildlife in the
hunting ground was tame at this time for it was unused to man. He
established a third farm by the sea in the western part of Myrar. This
was an even better place to look for driftwood. He planted crops there
and called the farm Akrar [Cornfields]. Offshore, there lay some islands
where whales gathered; they called these islands Hvalseyjar [Whale
Islands].</p>
<p>Skallagrim also sent his men up river to fish for salmon and settled
Odd the Lone-dweller at the Gljufra river to look after the
salmon-fishing. Odd lived at the foot of Einbuabrekkur [Lone-Dweller’s
Slopes] and Einbuaness is named after him. Skallagrim settled a man
called Sigmund by the Northra river. He lived at Sigmundarstead, which
is now called Haugar, and Sigmundarness is named after him. Later on,
Sigmund moved to Munodarness because it was more convenient for the
salmon-fishing.</p>
<p>As Skallagrim’s livestock increased in number, the animals started
going up to the mountains for the summer. Skallagrim discovered that
this made a big difference, for the cattle grew better and fatter when
they went up onto the heaths, and the sheep could survive the winter in
the mountain valleys without being brought down. So Skallagrim had a
dwelling built close to the mountains and set up a sheep farm there.
Since a man called Griss was in charge of the farm, Grisartungu is named
after him. And so, Skallagrim’s wealth flowed from many sources.</p>
