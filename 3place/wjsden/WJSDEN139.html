<h4 id="the-martyrdom-of-alfeah-saint-alphege">103. The Martyrdom of
Alfeah (Saint Alphege)</h4>
<p>The arrival of Christianity in Scandinavia did not always guarantee
respect for the persons of eminent clerics. In 1012, for example, the
Danish army under Thorkel the Tall murdered the archbishop of
Canterbury, Alfeah. The following entries from the Peterborough (Laud)
Chronicle show the increasing stylistic and historiographical
sophistication of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A. A. Somerville, from David Dumville and Simon
Keynes, general eds., The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1983–), vol. 7; MS E, ed. Susan Irvine
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2004), pp. 68–69.</p>
<p>1011</p>
<p>In this year, the king [Athelred II, the Unready = having no policy,
ca 968–1016] and his council sent word to the [Danish] army and begged
for peace. They promised tribute and food on condition that the Danes
ceased their pillaging. By then they had overrun East Anglia, Essex,
Middlesex, Oxfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
Bedfordshire, half of Huntingdonshire, and much of Northamptonshire.
South of the Thames, they had taken all of Kent, Sussex, Hastings,
Surrey, Berkshire, Hampshire, and much of Wiltshire.</p>
<p>All of these catastrophes befell us because of badly conceived
policies: we were reluctant to offer tribute in good time and unwilling
to fight against them. Not until they had inflicted immense damage did
we make peace with them and arrange a truce. Despite the truce and the
tribute, they spread all over the place in gangs and raided our wretched
people, pillaging and slaughtering them.</p>
<p>In the same year, between the Nativity of Saint Mary [8 September]
and Michaelmas [29 September], they besieged Canterbury and gained entry
through the treachery of Almær who owed his life to the archbishop
Alfeah. There they captured the archbishop as well as Alfweard, the
king’s reeve, the abbess Leofruna, and Bishop Godwine. They let the
abbot Almær go free. They took all the clerics in the city prisoner, as
well as the [lay]men and women; no one could tell how many people this
amounted to. They [the Danes] stayed in the city as long as they
pleased. Once they had searched the entire city, they returned to their
ships and took the archbishop with them.</p>
<p>The man who had been at the head of the English people and the
Christian world was now a captive. Now misery was on display in place of
the former happiness in the city from which Christianity first came to
us, bringing heavenly and earthly bliss.</p>
<p>They kept the archbishop with them until they martyred him.</p>
<p>1012</p>
<p>In this year, Eadric the aldorman [nobleman of highest rank] and all
the most senior councillors in England, both clerical and lay, came to
London before Easter, which fell on the Ides of April [13 April]. They
remained there until after Easter when the entire tribute was paid; the
tribute was forty-eight thousand pounds [weight in silver].</p>
<p>On the Saturday [19 April], the [Danish] army became very angry with
the [arch]bishop because he would not promise them money and would not
allow anyone to make payments on his behalf. In addition, they were very
drunk as wine had been brought in from the south. They seized the
[arch]bishop and dragged him off to their assembly on Saturday, the
octave of Easter [the seventh day after Easter], which fell thirteen
days before the Kalends of May [19 April]. At the assembly, they killed
him in a shameful manner. They pelted him with bones and the heads of
cattle; one of the Danes struck him on the head with the back of an ax
and dispatched his blessed soul to God’s kingdom. That blow knocked him
down and his blood poured onto the ground.</p>
<p>The next morning, his body was transported to London where the
bishops Eadnoth and Alfun and the citizens received him with every
honor; they buried him at St. Paul’s Cathedral where God now reveals the
powers of the holy martyr.</p>
<p>When the tribute had been paid and the peace sealed with oaths, the
army scattered just as far and wide as it had been a compact formation
before. Then forty-five of the army’s ships came over to the king and
promised to guard this land if he fed and clothed them.</p>
