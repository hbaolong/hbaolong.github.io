Rognvald and Thorfinn the Mighty Fight It Out in the Orkneys</h4>
<p>For many years, Earl Thorfinn the Mighty (1009?–1064) was sole ruler
of the Orkneys. Late in the 1030s, his nephew, Rognvald Brusason, with
the support of Magnus the Good (king of Norway 1035–47), claimed his
father’s share of the Orkneys. Thorfinn was obliged to accept the claim,
and the two ruled side by side until the arrival of Kalf Arnason (uncle
of Thorfinn’s wife) caused strain between them. In the ensuing war,
Rognvald was supported by Magnus the Good, who provided him with ships
and men. From Orkneyinga saga, a history of the earls of Orkney from the
tenth to the thirteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Orkneyinga saga, ed. Finnbogi
Guðmundsson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXIV (Reykjavík, 1965), pp. 65–70.</p>
<ol start="26" type="1">
<li>Earl Rognvald sailed west from Norway to the Orkneys. He landed in
the Shetlands first and gathered forces there. Then he went south to the
Orkneys, where he sent for his friends and recruited reinforcements.
Earl Thorfinn was in Caithness and it wasn’t long before he heard about
Earl Rognvald’s movements vand raised troops in Scotland and the
Hebrides. Earl Rognvald immediately forwarded King Magnus’s message to
Kalf Arnason [that Kalf’s property would be restored and he would be
permitted to live in Norway], and Kalf was satisfied with everything the
king had said.</li>
</ol>
<p>Earl Rognvald gathered his army together in the Orkneys, intending to
cross over to Caithness, and he had thirty large ships when he came into
the Pentland Firth. There he came up against Earl Thorfinn with sixty
ships, most of which were small; they met off Robery, and the fighting
began immediately. Kalf Arnason turned up with six large ships, but did
not join the battle. The fighting grew ferocious as the earls urged on
their men, but after a while, the casualties began to mount on Earl
Thorfinn’s side, mainly because of the difference in height of their
ships. Thorfinn himself had a large, well-equipped ship and he pressed
forward courageously, but, when his smaller ships had been disabled, his
own ship was attacked from both sides. This was a perilous situation;
many of his crew were killed or seriously wounded. Then Earl Rognvald
exhorted his men to board Thorfinn’s ship, but when Thorfinn realized
the danger he was in, he gave orders for his ship to be cut loose from
the others and rowed ashore.</p>
<p>There, he had seventy bodies carried from his ship. He also put
ashore all those who were too badly wounded to fight. Then he asked
Arnor Jarlaskald [Poet of Earls] to disembark too; Arnor was one of his
retainers and was held in high regard. So Arnor went ashore and composed
this poem:</p>
<p>Unwilling is this warrior</p>
<p>to battle with Brusi’s son;</p>
<p>It is excellent to serve one’s earl,</p>
<p>—I do not deny that;</p>
<p>so when earls are eager</p>
<p>to attack each other,</p>
<p>it’s a hard choice I have</p>
<p>—A tough trial of friendship.</p>
<p>Earl Thorfinn manned his ship with the best men he had left. Then he
went to Kalf and asked for his help. He told Kalf that he was unlikely
to win back King Magnus’s friendship after being driven out of
Norway.</p>
<p>“If you weren’t safe while you were on good terms with the king,”
said Thorfinn, “do you think that you’ll be welcome here if Rognvald
defeats me, and he and King Magnus extend their authority to this side
of the western sea? But if we are victorious, you won’t lack for
anything that it’s in my power to give you, and if we’re both of one
mind, we won’t be at anyone’s mercy on this side of the sea. Surely you
won’t want to have it on your conscience that you were lurking here like
a cat in its den while I was fighting to keep both of us free? Besides,
our family ties oblige us to help each other when we’re up against
strangers.”</p>
<p>Goaded into action by Thorfinn, Kalf called his men together and
ordered them into battle beside the earl. Bjarni Gullbrarskald composed
this verse:</p>
<p>Kalf, we have heard how</p>
<p>you followed Finn’s kinsman,</p>
<p>sailed your snake-ships</p>
<p>eagerly against the earl:</p>
<p>quelled the rash courage</p>
<p>of Brusi’s bold son;</p>
<p>when, mindful of former malice,</p>
<p>you hastened to help Thorfinn.</p>
<p>Now Kalf and Earl Thorfinn both rowed to the attack, but by the time
they reached the battle, Thorfinn’s fleet was poised to flee, for many
of his men had been killed. Thorfinn steered straight for Rognvald’s
ship and a terrible fight took place. Here is how Arnor describes
it:</p>
<p>My grief grew</p>
<p>as I saw both benefactors</p>
<p>slaughter each other’s soldiers,</p>
<p>fighting in Pentland Firth;</p>
<p>stained was the sea, as</p>
<p>dark gore seeped through seams</p>
<p>of ships, and shield—</p>
<p>boards sweated blood.</p>
<p>Kalf attacked the smaller of Rognvald’s ships; he was able to clear
them quickly since his own ships had a considerable advantage in height.
When the soldiers levied in Norway saw the ships near them being
cleared, they cut the ropes that linked their own ships and fled. Soon
there were hardly any ships left to support the earl, and at that point
the battle turned against him. As Arnor Jarlaskald says:</p>
<p>The battle-eager earl could</p>
<p>have taken the old territory,</p>
<p>—there was less loss of life</p>
<p>among his men—</p>
<p>if Kalf and his crews</p>
<p>had sailed with the sea-king;</p>
<p>but they showed Shetland’s</p>
<p>lord little loyalty.</p>
<p>Now that the main part of Rognvald’s army had fled, Kalf and Earl
Thorfinn attacked his ship together and killed many of his men. When
Earl Rognvald realized what straits he was in, and that he could not
defeat Thorfinn and Kalf, he had his ship cut loose from the coupling
ropes and fled. The day was far gone by then, and it was growing dark.
That very night, Earl Rognvald put to sea and sailed east to Norway. He
did not break his journey until he reached King Magnus. As before, the
king made him welcome and invited him to stay. Earl Rognvald remained
there for some time.</p>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li>The following morning, Earl Thorfinn sent his men rowing all around
the Orkneys in search of fugitives. Many of them were killed, while
others were spared. Earl Thorfinn gained control over all the Orkneys
and ordered everyone to accept his authority, even those who had sworn
oaths to Rognvald. He established himself in Orkney with a large
entourage and brought provisions over from Caithness. He also sent Kalf
Arnason to the Hebrides to strengthen his position there….</li>
