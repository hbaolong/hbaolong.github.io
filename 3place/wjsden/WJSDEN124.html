<h4 id="the-death-of-gunnar-aaaaaaaa">85. The Death of Gunnar
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Earlier in the saga, Njal has warned Gunnar that, if he wants to
avoid disaster, he should not kill two members of the same family.
Unfortunately, in the web of violence and retaliation that surrounds
Gunnar, he manages to kill two members of Gizur the White’s family. The
powerful Gizur has Gunnar banished as an outlaw from Iceland, but Gunnar
cannot bear to leave his beloved land. Inevitably, Gizur and his allies
come to take their revenge, as the law allows them to do. From Njal’s
Saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 185–91.</p>
<ol start="76" type="1">
<li>In the Autumn, Mord Valgardsson sent word that Gunnar would be home
alone, while all his people were down on the islands finishing the
haymaking. As soon as they heard this, Gizur the White and Geir the Godi
[priest, chieftain] rode east, over the rivers and across the sands, to
Hof. Then they sent word to Starkad down at Thrihyrning. All Gunnar’s
would-be attackers met at Hof to discuss how they should go about the
business. Mord said that they would never take Gunnar by surprise unless
they seized the neighboring farmer, Thorkell, and forced him to go along
with them. Then they could send him on alone to Gunnar’s homestead to
catch the dog, Sam.</li>
</ol>
<p>So they traveled east to Hlidarend and sent men in search of
Thorkell. They captured him and offered him two choices: be killed or
get the dog. He preferred to save his life and went with them. Leading
down to the farmyard at Hlidarend was a walled path and here the group
stopped. Thorkell the farmer went on to the farmstead. The dog was lying
on the housetop and Thorkell enticed him up the lane. As soon as the dog
saw the other men, he leapt at Thorkell and bit him in the groin. Onund
of Trollaskog struck the dog on the head with his ax. The ax penetrated
right to its brain and, with an incredibly loud howl, the dog fell down
dead.</p>
<ol start="77" type="1">
<li>Inside the house, Gunnar woke up. “Sam my friend,” he said, “you
have been cruelly treated, and perhaps this is a sign that our deaths
won’t be far apart.” Gunnar’s dwelling was built entirely of wood with
an outer shell of overlapping planks. Near the ridge-beams were windows
protected by shutters. Gunnar slept in a loft in the house along with
Hallgerd and his mother.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Gizur and the others approached, they had no idea if Gunnar was
at home so they asked someone to go ahead and find out; the others sat
down on the ground. Thorgrim the Norwegian scrambled up onto the roof.
Gunnar saw a red tunic passing in front of the window and thrust at the
middle of it with his halberd. The Norwegian lost his shield and his
footing, and tumbled down from the roof. He went back to Gizur and the
others who were sitting on the ground. Gizur looked at him and asked,
“So, is Gunnar at home?” “Find out for yourselves,” Thorgrim answered.
“But I’ve found out one thing: his halberd is at home.” Then he fell
down dead.</p>
<p>The rest of them headed for the house. Gunnar showered them with
arrows and defended himself so well that they got nowhere. Some climbed
onto the buildings intending to attack him from the roof, but Gunnar
could get at them with his arrows and they made no headway. The
stalemate continued for a while. Then they took a rest and attacked
again, but Gunnar kept up his hail of arrows. Once again, they gained no
ground and retreated a second time.</p>
<p>Then Gizur the White said, “Let’s attack more fiercely; we’re getting
nowhere.” They launched a third attack and kept it up a long time, but
again they fell back.</p>
<p>Gunnar said, “One of their arrows is lying outside on the roof. I’ll
shoot it at them. It will be humiliating for them to be wounded by their
own weapons.” His mother replied, “Don’t do that: you will only provoke
them when they have already withdrawn.”</p>
<p>Gunnar seized the arrow and shot it at them. It struck Eilif
Onundarson, wounding him seriously. He was standing by himself and his
companions did not realize that he was wounded.</p>
<p>Gizur said, “Over there, an arm wearing a gold ring reached out and
picked up an arrow lying on the roof. They wouldn’t be looking for
arrows outside, if there were enough inside; we must attack now.”</p>
<p>Mord said, “Let’s burn him alive inside his house.” “Never,” said
Gizur, “even if my life depended on it. But surely someone with your
reputation for cunning can come up with a workable plan.”</p>
<p>Lying on the ground were some ropes used to tie down the house. Mord
said, “Let’s take the ropes and wind them around the ends of the
roof-beams. Then we’ll fasten the other ends of the ropes to rocks, and
winch the roof off the house.”</p>
<p>They picked up the ropes and got everything ready. Before Gunnar knew
anything about it, they had pulled the whole roof off the house. Gunnar
kept shooting with his bow so they couldn’t get near him. Then Mord said
a second time that they should burn Gunnar alive inside his house. Gizur
replied, “I don’t know why you keep going on about something that no one
else wants to do, something that must never happen.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Thorbrand Thorleiksson leapt onto the roof and
severed Gunnar’s bowstring. Turning quickly, Gunnar seized his halberd
with both hands, drove it through Thorbrand, and hurled him off the
roof. Then Asbrand, Thorbrand’s brother, leapt up and Gunnar thrust at
him with his halberd. Asbrand defended himself with his shield, but the
halberd ran right through the shield between his upper and lower arm.
Gunnar twisted his halberd so that the shield split and both parts of
the arm were broken. Asbrand, too, fell from the roof. By this time,
Gunnar had wounded eight men and killed two. Then he was wounded twice,
but everyone said that he flinched neither at wounds nor at death.</p>
<p>He said to Hallgerd, “Give me two locks of your hair; you and my
mother can twist them together to make a bowstring for me.”</p>
<p>“Does anything depend on it?” she said.</p>
<p>“My life depends on it,” he replied, “for they will never get the
better of me as long as I can use my bow.”</p>
<p>“Well then,” she said, “I’m going to repay you now for the slap on
the face you once gave me. And I couldn’t care less how long you hold
out.”</p>
<p>“Everyone wins fame somehow,” said Gunnar. “I won’t ask you
again.”</p>
<p>Rannveig said to her, “You are a wicked woman, and your shame will
last for a long time.”</p>
<p>Gunnar defended himself bravely and well, wounding eight more men so
terribly that many were close to death. He fought on until he fell
exhausted. His attackers inflicted many serious wounds on him, but even
then he escaped from their hands and warded them off for a long time.
Finally, however, they killed him. Thorkel Elfaraskald made up this poem
about Gunnar’s defense:</p>
<p>They say how the seafaring</p>
<p>Gunnar, great-spirited in battle,</p>
<p>hewing with his halberd,</p>
<p>defended himself to the death;</p>
<p>sixteen he wounded sorely,</p>
<p>bearers of shields in battle,</p>
<p>two he doomed to death,</p>
<p>killed them south of Kjol.</p>
<p>Gizur said, “We have brought down a great warrior and it has been
hard work indeed. His defense will be remembered as long as this land is
inhabited.”</p>
<p>He walked over to Rannveig and said, “Will you give us some ground
here where we can bury our two dead?”</p>
<p>“I’d rather provide ground for all of you, not just for two,” she
replied.</p>
<p>“You have every excuse for speaking like this,” said Gizur. “You have
suffered a great loss.” He gave orders that there should be no pillaging
or destruction. After that, they left.</p>
<p>Then Thorgeir, son of Starkad, spoke, “We can’t stay at home on our
farms for fear of the Sigfussons unless you, Gizur, or you, Geir, stay
here in the south for a while.”</p>
<p>“So be it,” said Gizur.</p>
<p>They drew straws and it fell to Geir’s lot to stay behind in the
south. He went to Oddi and settled there. Geir had a son called Hroald.
Hroald was illegitimate; his mother was Bjartey, sister of Thorvald the
ailing, who was killed near Hestlok in Grimsness. Hroald boasted that he
had given Gunnar his death wound. He stayed at Oddi with his father.
Thorgeir, son of Starkad, boasted that he too had wounded Gunnar. Gizur
remained at home in Mosfell. The killing of Gunnar was denounced in
every district. He was deeply mourned by many men.</p>
