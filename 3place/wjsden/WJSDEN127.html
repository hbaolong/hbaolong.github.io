<h4 id="early-missions-to-the-north-the-life-of-saint-anskar">88. Early
Missions to the North: The Life of Saint Anskar</h4>
<p>Saint Anskar (d. 865), known as the “Apostle of the North,” conducted
missionary work in Denmark and Sweden and became the first Archbishop of
Hamburg-Bremen in 857. His hagiographer, Rimbert (d. 888), is a shadowy
figure about whom little is known, but he was a pupil of Anskar and
probably accompanied him on some of his travels. Rimbert’s Life of
Anskar was written soon after Anskar’s death and provides important
glimpses of early missions to the Scandinavian peoples.</p>
<p>Source: Trans. C.H. Robinson, Anskar: The Apostle of the North,
801–865, translated from the Vita Anskarii by Bishop Rimbert his fellow
missionary and successor (London 1921); revised by P.E. Dutton,
Carolingian Civilization, 2nd ed. (Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press,
2004), pp. 407–40.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>After this it happened that a king named Harald [Klak], who ruled
over some of the Danes, was assailed by hatred and malignity and was
driven from his kingdom by the other kings of the same province. He came
to his serene majesty the emperor Louis [the Pious; d. 840] and asked to
be thought worthy to receive his help so that he might be able to regain
his kingdom. While the emperor kept him at his court [in Ingelheim] he
urged him, by personal persuasion and through the agency of others, to
accept the Christian faith, because there would then be a more intimate
friendship between them and a Christian people would more readily come
to his aid and to the aid of his friends if both peoples were
worshippers of the same God. At length, by the assistance of divine
grace, he brought about his conversion, and when he had been sprinkled
with the holy water of baptism he himself received him from the sacred
font and adopted him as his son [in 826; see doc. 46].</li>
</ol>
<p>When, after that, [Louis] desired to send [Harald] back to his own
land in order that he might, by his assistance, seek to recover his
dominions, he began to make diligent inquiry to find a holy and devoted
man who could go and stay with him, and who might strengthen him and his
people and, by teaching the doctrine of salvation, might induce them to
receive the faith of the Lord. At a public gathering of his chief men at
which their priests and other good men were present, the emperor raised
to this matter and earnestly begged all of them to find someone who
might volunteer for this difficult and honorable task. When they refused
and said that they knew of no one who was possessed of so great a
devotion as to be willing to undertake this dangerous journey for the
name of Christ, Wala, who was at that time [from 826] the much respected
abbot of our monastery, said to the emperor that he knew a monk in his
monastery who burned with zeal for true religion and was eager to endure
suffering for the name of God. He declared, however, that he did not
know whether he would be willing to undertake this journey. Why say
more? At the king’s command Anskar was summoned to the palace and the
abbot explained to him everything that had been done and explained the
reason for his being summoned. He replied that as an obedient monk he
was ready to serve God in all things that were commanded of him. He was
then led into the presence of the emperor, who asked him whether on
God’s behalf and for the sake of preaching the Gospel among the Danish
peoples, he would become the companion of Harald, whereupon he replied
that he was entirely willing. When the abbot had further stated that he
would by no means impose this upon him as a command, but if of his own
free will he chose to do it he would be pleased and would give him his
authoritative consent. He replied that he none the less chose the task
and desired by all means to carry it through.</p>
<p>…The two monks [Anskar, and Autbert, who had volunteered to accompany
him] were subsequently brought before the king, who was gratified by
their willingness and desire to undertake this task and he gave them
whatever was necessary for the performance of their ministerial
functions, including writing cases, tents and other things that would be
helpful and which seemed likely to be needed on their great journey. He
bade them go with Harald and commanded them to devote the utmost care to
his profession of faith and by their godly exhortations to confirm in
the faith both Harald and the companions who had been baptized together
with him, for fear lest at the instigation of the devil they should
return to their former errors, and at the same time by their preaching
to urge others to accept the Christian religion.</p>
<p>Having then been then dismissed by the emperor they had none to
render them any menial service, as no one in the abbot’s household would
go with them of his own accord and he would compel no one to go against
his will. Harald, to whom they had been committed, was as yet ignorant
and untaught in the faith and was unaware how God’s servants ought to
behave. Moreover, his companions, who had been but recently converted
and had been trained in a very different faith, paid them little
attention. Having started then with considerable difficulty they arrived
at Cologne. At that time there was a venerable bishop there named
Hadebald. He had compassion for their needs and presented them with a
good boat in which they might place their possessions and in which there
were two cabins that had been suitably prepared for them. When Harald
saw the boat he decided to remain with them in it, so that he and they
could each have a cabin. This tended to promote an increase of
friendship and good will between them; his companions also, from this
time forward, paid careful attention to their wants.</p>
<p>On leaving the boat they passed through Dorestad and, crossing the
neighboring territory of the Frisians, came to the Danish border. As
King Harald could not for the time being obtain peaceful possession of
his kingdom, the emperor gave him a place beyond the Elbe River so that
if it were necessary he might halt there.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>Accordingly the servants of God, who were with him and who were
stationed at one time among the Christians and at other times among the
pagans, began to apply themselves to the word of God; and those whom
they could influence they directed into the way of truth, so that many
were converted to the faith by their example and teaching, and the
number of those who should be saved in the Lord increased daily. They
themselves, being inspired by divine love, in order to spread their holy
religion, made diligent search for boys whom they might endeavor to
educate for the service of God. Harald also gave some of his own
household to be educated by them; and so it came about that in a short
time they established a school for twelve or more boys. Others they took
as servants or helpers, and their reputation and the religion which they
preached in God’s name were spread abroad. After they had spent two
years or more in this good work brother Autbert was overcome with a
serious illness. For this reason he was taken to Corvey where, as his
weakness increased day by day, at Easter time (as it had been revealed
to him earlier by the Lord) he died, passing away happily, as we
believe.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile it happened that Swedish ambassadors had come to the
Emperor Louis, and, among other matters which they had been ordered to
bring to the attention of the emperor, they informed him that there were
many belonging to their people who desired to embrace the Christian
religion and that their king so far favored this suggestion that he
would permit God’s priests to reside there, provided that they might be
deemed worthy of such a favor and that the emperor would send them
suitable preachers. When the God-fearing emperor heard this he was
greatly delighted, and a second time he endeavored to find men whom he
might send into those districts, who might discover whether this people
was prepared to accept the faith, as the ambassadors had assured him,
and might begin to inculcate the observance of the Christian religion.
So it came about that his serene majesty began once again to discuss the
matter with your abbot and asked him whether by chance he could find one
of his monks who, for the name of Christ, was willing to go into those
parts; or who would go and stay with Harald while God’s servant Anskar,
who was with him, undertook this mission. Thus it was that Anskar was
summoned by royal command to the palace, and was told that he should not
even stop to shave himself before coming into the royal
presence…..</p></li>
<li><p>Then, by the good providence of God, the venerable abbot [Wala]
found for him among your fraternity a companion, namely the prior
Witmar, who was both worthy and willing to undertake this great task. He
further arranged that the good father Gislemar, a man approved by faith
and good works, and by his fervent zeal for God, should stay with
Harald. Anskar then undertook the mission committed to him by the
emperor, who desired that he should go to the Swedes and discover
whether that people was prepared to accept the faith as their messengers
had declared. How great and serious were the calamities which he
suffered while engaged in this mission, father Witmar, who himself
shared them, can best tell. It may suffice for me to say that while they
were in the midst of their journey they fell into the hands of pirates.
The merchants with whom they were traveling defended themselves
vigorously and for a time successfully, but eventually they were
conquered and overcome by the pirates, who took from them their ships
and all that they possessed, while they themselves barely escaped on
foot to land. They lost then the royal gifts which they should have
delivered there, together with all their other possessions, save only
what they were able to take and carry away with them as they left the
ship. They were plundered, moreover, of nearly forty books which they
had accumulated for the service of God. When this happened some were
disposed to turn and go back, but no argument could divert God’s servant
from the journey which he had undertaken. On the contrary, he submitted
everything that might happen to him to God’s will and was by no means
disposed to return until, with God’s help, he could ascertain whether he
would be allowed to preach the Gospel in those parts.</p></li>
<li><p>With great difficulty they accomplished their long journey on
foot, traversing also the intervening seas, where it was possible, by
ship, and eventually arrived at the Swedish port called Birka. They were
kindly received in that place by the king, who was called Biorn [II],
whose messengers had informed him of the reason for which they had come.
When he understood the object of their mission and had discussed the
matter with his men, with the approval and consent of all, he granted
them permission to remain there and to preach the Gospel of Christ and
offered liberty to any who desired it to accept their teaching.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Accordingly the servants of God, when they saw that matters had
turned out propitiously as they had desired, began eagerly to preach the
word of salvation to the people of that place. There were many who were
well disposed towards their mission and who willingly listened to the
teaching of the Lord. There were also many Christians who were held
captive among them, and who rejoiced that now at last they were able to
participate in the divine mysteries. It was thus made clear that
everything was as their messengers had declared to the emperor, and some
of them desired earnestly to receive the grace of baptism. These
included the prefect of this town named Herigar, who was a counselor of
the king and much loved by him. He received the gift of holy baptism and
was strengthened in the Catholic faith. A little later he built a church
on his own ancestral property and served God with the utmost devotion.
Several remarkable deeds were accomplished by this man who afforded many
proofs of his invincible faith….</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>When the servants of God had spent another half year with them
and had attained the object of their mission they returned to the
emperor and took with them letters written by the king himself in
characters fashioned after the Swedish custom [possibly in runes]. They
were received with great honor and good will by the emperor, to whom
they narrated all that the Lord had wrought by them and how in those
parts the door of faith was opened by which these peoples were bidden to
enter. When the most pious emperor heard this, he rejoiced greatly. And
as he recalled the beginning which had been made in establishing the
worship of God among the Danes, he rendered praise and thanks to
Almighty God, and, being inflamed with zeal for the faith, he began to
inquire by what means he might establish a bishop’s see in the north
within the limits of his own empire, from which the bishop who should be
stationed there might make frequent journeys to the northern regions for
the sake of preaching the Gospel and from which all these barbarous
people might easily and profitably receive the sacraments of the divine
mystery….</p></li>
<li><p>…As we have already said, the same office of legate had before
been entrusted by Pope Paschal [I, 817–824] to Ebbo, the archbishop of
Rheims. Ebbo himself, inspired by the Spirit of God, burned with eager
desire to draw to the Christian fold the non-Christian races and
especially the Danes whom he had often seen at the palace and who, as he
grieved to see, had been led astray by the wiles of the devil. In order
to promote their salvation he longed to sacrifice himself and all that
he possessed. The emperor had given him a place situated beyond the
Elbe, which was called Welanao, so that whenever he went into those
parts he might have a place in which to stay. Accordingly he frequently
went to this place and distributed much money in the northern districts
in order that he might win the souls of the people; and he attached many
to the Christian religion and strengthened them in the catholic
faith.</p></li>
<li><p>…With the consent, then, and approval of the emperor, the
venerable Ebbo sent to Sweden a relation of his own named Gautbert who
had been chosen for this work and had been given the honorable rank of a
bishop. He supplied him in abundance with all that was wanted for his
ecclesiastical office and for his necessary expenditure at his own cost
and that of the emperor. Having himself undertaken, by apostolic
authority, the office of an evangelist, he appointed Gautbert to act as
legate on his behalf among the Swedes. To him, too, the emperor, at the
suggestion of the same bishop Ebbo, gave the monastery which he had
himself built at Welanao, to serve as a place of refuge, in order that
the performance of his task might be rendered permanent and secure. This
Gautbert [d. 845], who at his consecration received the honored name of
the apostle Simon, went to Sweden, and was honorably received by the
king [Biorn II] and the people; and he began, amidst general good will
and approval, to build a church there and to preach the faith of the
Gospel and there was great rejoicing among the Christians who were
living there and the number of those who believed increased
daily.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile our lord and master [Anskar] diligently executed his
office in the diocese that had been committed to him and in the country
of the Danes and by the example of his good life he incited many to
embrace the faith. He began also to buy Danish and Slav boys and to
redeem some from captivity so that he might train them for God’s
service. Of these he kept some with him, while others he sent to be
trained at the monastery of Turholt. There were also with him here
belonging to your order some of our fathers and teachers, as a result of
whose teaching and instructions the divine religion has increased among
us.</p></li>
<li><p>…It happened, too, at this time, at the instigation of the devil,
that the Swedish people were inflamed with zeal and fury, and began by
insidious means to persecute Bishop Gautbert. Thus it came about that
some of the people, moved by a common impulse, made a sudden attack upon
the house in which he was staying with the object of destroying it; and
in their hatred of the Christian name they killed Nithard and made him,
in our opinion, a true martyr. Gautbert himself and those of his
companions who were present they bound and, after plundering everything
that they could find in their house, they drove them from their
territory with insults and abuse. This was not done by command of the
king, but was brought about by a plot devised by the people.</p></li>
<li><p>For nearly seven years afterwards there was no priest in this
place [in Sweden], and for this reason our lord and pastor Anskar was
afflicted with great sorrow. As he could not bear that the Christian
religion which had begun to be established there should perish and
because he grieved greatly for his dear son Herigar, whom we have
already mentioned, he sent a hermit named Ardgar into those parts and
specially directed him to attach himself to Herigar. On his arrival he
was courteously received by Herigar and his presence brought great joy
to the Christians who were there. These began again to do as they had
done before, namely to search diligently for the things of God and to
observe with a willing mind the customs of the Christian religion. None
of the unbelievers was able to withstand his preaching, because they
remembered with fear the punishment that had come upon those who had
expelled God’s servants from this place. On the suggestion of Herigar
and with the command and permission of the king who was then reigning,
he began to celebrate the divine mysteries in public.</p></li>
<li><p>But inasmuch as we have spoken in advance concerning the
arrangements that were made relating to this diocese (for a long time
elapsed after Anskar had undertaken the government of this see before it
was settled by apostolic authority) let us now go back to the events of
an earlier period. For after he took over the diocese of Bremen and
became possessed of some resources he began once more to desire
fervently that, if it were possible, he might labor on Christ’s behalf
among the Danes. For this reason he paid frequent visits to Rorik, who
was at that time the sole monarch of the Danes, and endeavored to
conciliate him by gifts and by any possible kinds of service in the hope
that he might gain permission to preach in his kingdom. On several
occasions he was sent to him as an ambassador of the king and sought
strenuously and faithfully to bring about a peace that should be
advantageous to either kingdom. His fidelity and goodness having been so
recognized, King Rorik began to regard him with great affection and to
make use of his advice and to treat him in every respect as a friend, so
that he was allowed to share his secrets when with his fellow counselors
he was dealing with matters relating to the kingdom. Concerning matters
that had to be arranged in order to establish an alliance between the
people of this land, that is the Saxons, and his own kingdom, the king
only desired that it should be guaranteed by his pledge, as he said that
he had complete confidence in regard to everything that he approved and
promised. When Anskar had thus gained his friendship he began to urge
him to become a Christian. The king listened to all that was reported to
him out of the Holy Scriptures and declared that it was both good and
helpful and that he took great delight therein, and that he desired to
earn the favor of Christ.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After he had expressed these desires our good father suggested to him
that he grant to the Lord Christ that which would be most pleasing to
him, namely permission to build a church in his kingdom where a priest
might always be present who might commit to those who were willing to
receive them the seeds of the Divine Word and the grace of baptism. The
king most kindly granted this permission and allowed him to build a
church in a part belonging to his kingdom, called Sliaswich, which was
specially suitable for this purpose and was near to the district where
merchants from all parts congregated; he gave also a place in which a
priest might live, and likewise granted permission to anyone in his
kingdom who desired to become a Christian.</p>
<p>When our lord bishop obtained this permission he at once did that
which he had long desired. And when a priest had been established there,
the grace of God began to bear much fruit in that place, for there were
many who had already become Christians and had been baptized in Dorestad
or Hamburg, among whom were the principal people of the place, who
rejoiced at the opportunity afforded them to observe their religion.
Many others also, both men and women, followed their example, and having
abandoned the superstitious worship of idols, believed in the Lord and
were baptized. There was, moreover, great joy in that place as the men
of this place could now do what was before forbidden and traders both
from here [Hamburg] and from Dorestad freely sought to visit this place,
and an opportunity was afforded for doing much good there. And while
many who were baptized there have survived, an innumerable host of those
who were clothed in white [those who delayed baptism until the hour of
death] have ascended to the heavenly kingdom. For they were willingly
marked with the sign of the cross in order to become catechumens, and
that they might enter the church and be present at the sacred offices;
but they deferred the reception of baptism, as they judged that it was
to their advantage to be baptized at the end of their lives, so that,
having been cleansed by water unto salvation, they might without any
delay enter the gates of eternal life as those who were pure and
spotless. Many also among them, who were overcome with sickness, when
they saw that their sacrifices offered to idols in order to secure their
recovery were of no avail and when their neighbors despaired of their
getting well, took refuge in the Lord’s mercy and vowed that they would
become Christians. When a priest had been summoned and they had received
the grace of baptism, by divine help they forthwith recovered their
health. In such a manner did the divine compassion spread in that place
and a multitude of people were converted to the Lord.</p>
<ol start="25" type="1">
<li><p>Meanwhile our lord and master Anskar, being greatly distressed on
behalf of the Swedish race because it was at that time without a priest,
begged King Rorik, who was his intimate friend, to help him make an
effort to reach this kingdom. The king received this request with the
utmost good will and promised that he would do everything to help.
Accordingly the bishop began to negotiate with Bishop Gautbert saying
that a further attempt must be made to discover whether this race,
having been divinely admonished, would permit priests to dwell among
them, so that the Christian faith, which had been established in those
parts, might not perish in consequence of their neglect. Bishop
Gautbert, who is also called Simon, replied that, as he had been
expelled from that country, he would not venture to go there again and
that the attempt could not be advantageous, but would on the contrary be
dangerous, should those who remembered what happened before raise a
disturbance about him. He said that it seemed to him to be more fitting
that he should go who was the first to undertake this mission and who
had been kindly treated there, and that he would send with him his
nephew [Erimbert] who might remain there, should he find an opportunity
for preaching, and might perform the duties of a priest among the
people. When they had so decided, they came to King Louis and told him
the reason for their action and begged that he would permit them to do
this. He asked whether they themselves had come to an agreement,
whereupon the venerable Bishop Gautbert replied: “We are in the service
of God and always have been united and it is our unanimous desire that
this should be done.” Accordingly, the king, who was ever ready to
further God’s work, enjoined this mission upon our holy father in
accordance with the terms they had agreed among themselves and, on his
part, entrusted to the bishop injunctions addressed to the king of
Sweden as his father had done previously.</p></li>
<li><p>As he was then about to set out on this journey he took with him
the message and the token given him by King Rorik, who directed him to
give the message to the Swedish king named Olaf and to say that the
messenger whom King Louis had sent to his kingdom was well known to him
and that he had never before in his life seen so good a man, nor had he
ever found any other human being so trustworthy. In recognition of his
goodness he had allowed him to do whatever he wished in his kingdom in
the interests of the Christian religion and King Louis begged that he
would permit him to establish the Christian religion in his own kingdom,
as he desired, for he would do nothing that would not be good and
right.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Anskar accomplished the journey on which he had set out and after
spending nearly twenty days in a ship, he arrived at Birka where he
found that the king and many of the people were perplexed by grievous
errors. It happened, at the instigation of the devil, who knew
beforehand of the coming of this good man, that someone had come there
and said that he had been present at a meeting of the gods, who were
believed to be the owners of this land, and had been sent by them to
make this announcement to the king and the people:</p>
<p>You, I say, have long enjoyed our good will, and under our protection
the land in which you dwell has long been fertile and has had peace and
prosperity. You have also duly sacrificed and performed the vows made to
us, and your worship has been very pleasing to us. But now you are
keeping back the usual sacrifices and are slothful in paying your
voluntary offerings; you are, moreover, displeasing us greatly by
introducing a foreign god in order to supplant us. If you want to enjoy
our good will, offer the sacrifices that have been omitted and give
greater vows. And do not receive the worship of any other god, who
teaches that which is opposed to our teaching, nor pay any attention to
his service. Furthermore, if you desire to have more gods and we do not
suffice, we will agree to summon your former king, Eric [III] to join us
so that he may be one of the gods.</p>
<p>This devilish announcement, which was publicly made on the arrival of
the bishop, disturbed the minds of all and their hearts were deceived
and disquieted. For they had resolved to have a temple in honor of the
late king and had begun to render votive offerings and sacrifices to him
as to a god. When, then, the bishop came there, he asked his friends,
the ones he had formerly known there, how he might speak to the king on
this matter. They all, with one accord, disagreed with him doing so and
said that for the time being this mission could effect nothing, and that
if he had anything of value with him he should give it to the king so
that he might escape with his life. He replied, “For the saving of my
life would I give nothing, for, if my Lord shall so ordain, I am ready
to submit to torments and to suffer death for his name.” Being in great
uncertainty in regard to this matter, he acted on the advice that he
received, and invited the king to partake of his hospitality. Then, as a
fellow-guest, he offered what gifts he could and gave him the things
with which he had been entrusted, for the cause of his coming had
already been explained to the king by Rorik’s messenger and by the
bishop’s friends who resided there. The king was delighted with his
kindness and liberality, and said that he gladly agreed to what he had
proposed. He said:</p>
<p>In former times there have been clergy who have been driven out by a
rising of the people and not by the command of the king. On this account
I have not the power, nor do I dare, to approve the objects of your
mission until I can determine our gods by the casting of lots and until
I can determine the will of the people in regard to this matter. Let
your messenger attend with me the next assembly and I will speak to the
people on your behalf. And if they approve your desire and the gods
consent, that which you have asked shall be successfully carried out,
but if it should turn out otherwise, I will let you know. It is our
custom that the control of public business of every kind should rest
with the whole people and not with the king.</p>
<p>When our good pastor received the king’s reply he turned to the Lord
for refuge, gave up his time to fasting and prayer, and with heartfelt
contrition he humbled himself before God.</p>
<ol start="27" type="1">
<li>While he was in this difficult position and the time for the
assembly drew near, he was one day engaged in the service of the Mass
and, while the priest was standing by the altar and was blessing the
sacred mysteries, a divine inspiration came upon him as he prostrated
himself on the ground. Strengthened, then, by the gift of the Holy
Spirit and adorned with the most complete confidence, he recognized that
all would turn out as he desired. Accordingly, when the Mass was
finished, he declared to this same priest, who was his most intimate
associate, that he ought to have no fear, for God himself would be his
helper. When the priest asked how he knew this he replied that his
knowledge was divinely inspired. The brother was able to recognize this
divine illumination, as he knew that he had been divinely inspired in
many previous instances, and the result quickly justified his
confidence.</li>
</ol>
<p>As soon as his chiefs were assembled the king began to discuss with
them the mission on which our father had come. They determined that an
enquiry should be made by the casting of lots in order to discover the
will of the gods. They went out, therefore, to the plain, in accordance
with their custom, and the lot decided that it was the will of God that
the Christian religion should be established there. When this happened,
one of the chief men, who was a friend of the bishop, told him at once
and advised him to be comforted, and said, “Be strong and act with
vigor, for God has not denied your wish nor rejected your mission.” He
was then full of courage and rejoicing in spirit exulted in the Lord.
When the day for the assembly which was held in the town of Birka drew
near, in accordance with their national custom the king caused a
proclamation to be made to the people by the voice of a herald, in order
that they might be informed concerning the object of their mission. On
hearing this, those who had before been led astray into error, held
discordant and confused opinions. In the midst of the noise and
confusion one of the older men among them said:</p>
<p>Listen to me, O king and people. In regard to the worship of this God
it is well known to many of us that he can afford much help to those who
place their hope in him. For many of us have proved this to be the case
on several occasions when in peril from sea and in other crises. Why,
then, do we reject that which we know to be both needful and
serviceable? Some of us who have on various occasions been to Dorestad
have of our own accord adopted this form of religion, believing it to be
beneficial. Our way there is now beset by those who lie in wait for us
and is rendered dangerous by the attacks of pirates. Why then do we not
take that which is brought to us and which, when it was at a distance,
we sought eagerly to obtain? We have frequently proved that the help
afforded by this God can be useful to us. Why should we not gladly agree
to continue as his servants? Consider carefully, O people, and do not
cast away that which will be to your advantage. For, inasmuch as we can
not be sure that our gods will be favorably disposed, it is good for us
to have the help of this God who is always and under all circumstances
able and willing to succor those who cry out to him.</p>
<p>When he had finished speaking all the people unanimously decided that
the priests should remain with them and that everything that pertained
to the performance of the Christian mysteries should be done without
objection or hindrance. The king then rose up from among the assembly
and forthwith directed one of his own messengers to accompany the
bishop’s messenger and to tell him that the people were unanimously
inclined to accept his proposal and at the same time to tell him that,
while their action was entirely agreeable to him, he could not give his
full consent until, in another assembly, which was to be held in another
part of his kingdom, he could announce this resolution to the people who
lived in that district.</p>
<p>Once again, then, our good father sought, as was his custom, for
divine assistance, and eagerly besought God’s mercy. When the time for
the assembly came and the king had caused to be proclaimed by the voice
of a herald the object for which the bishop had come and all that had
been said and done at the previous assembly by divine providence, the
hearts of all became as one, so that they adopted the resolution passed
by the former assembly and declared that they too would give their
entire and complete assent.</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li><p>When this had been done the king summoned the bishop and told him
what had occurred. The king accordingly, with the good will and approval
of all, determined that churches might be built among the people and
that priests might come to them and that whoever so desired might become
a Christian without objection or hindrance. Our lord and pastor then
commended to the care of the king, Erimbert, the nephew of the venerable
Bishop Gautbert, in order that, with his help and protection, he might
there perform the sacred mysteries and to him the king granted
permission to build a hall to serve as a place of prayer in the town
already mentioned; the bishop also bought another courtyard, together
with a house in which the priest might live. The king displayed further
his affectionate regard for the lord bishop and promised that in every
district he would show the utmost kindness to his companions who were
concerned with the observance of the Christian religion. When, then, by
the Lord’s grace everything had been duly accomplished the bishop
returned to his own house.</p></li>
<li><p>Meanwhile [in 854] it happened by divine judgment that King Rorik
was killed in war in a disturbance caused by pirates while his kinsman
were attempting to invade his kingdom. Together with him all the chief
men of that land, who had formerly been acquaintances and friends of the
bishop, perished by the sword. When at length the younger Rorik had been
established in the kingdom, some of those who were then his chief men
and had not been so well known to the bishop, tried to persuade him that
the church that had been built among them should be destroyed and that
the Christian religion should be abolished. For they said that their
gods were angry and that these great evils had come upon them because
they had accepted the worship of another and an unknown god. Accordingly
the headman [or count] of the village of Sliaswich, whose name was Hovi,
who was particularly opposed to this religion, urged the king to destroy
the Christian faith, and he ordered the church that had been built there
to be shut and prohibited the observance of the Christian religion. On
this account the priest, who had been [in charge] there, was forced to
withdraw because of the bitter persecution.</p></li>
<li><p>The Conversion of the Danes Under Harald Bluetooth</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Whatever the impact of early missionaries like Saint Anskar in the
north, conversion in Scandinavia was associated with a series of
Christianizing kings of the mid-tenth to early eleventh centuries.In
Denmark, conversion is attributed to King Harald Gormsson Bluetooth,
whose achievements are related first and foremost on the runestone that
he had erected at Jelling (see doc. 101). Adam of Bremen also recounted
the events surrounding the conversion of the Danish royal house to
Christianity in the mid-tenth century. Very little is known of King
Gorm, and it is uncertain to what extent Adam’s depiction of him as
hostile to Christianity should be accepted.</p>
<p>Source: trans. F.J. Tschan, Adam of Bremen, History of the
Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, with new introduction by T. Reuter (New
York: Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 49–51, 55–57.</p>
<p>1.57. …Over the Danes there ruled at that time Harthacanute Gorm
[d. 958], a savage worm, I say, and not moderately hostile to the
Christian people. He set about completely to destroy Christianity in
Denmark, driving the priests of God from its bounds and also torturing
very many of them to death.</p>
<p>1.58. But then King Henry [I of Germany, r. 919–936], who feared God
even from his boyhood and placed all trust in his mercy, triumphed over
the Hungarians in many and mighty battles. Likewise he struck down the
Bohemians and the Sorbs, who had been subdued by other kings, and the
other Slavic peoples, with such force in one great encounter that the
rest—and just a few were left—of their own accord promised the king that
they would pay tribute, and God that they would be Christians.</p>
<p>1.59. Then he invaded Denmark with an army [934] and in the first
battle so thoroughly terrified King Gorm that the latter pledged himself
to obey his commands and, as a suppliant, sued for peace. The victorious
Henry then set the bounds of the kingdom at Schleswig, which is now
called Haddeby, appointed a margrave, and ordered a colony of Saxons to
settle there. All these facts, related by a certain Danish bishop, a
prudent man, we transmit to our Church as faithfully as we have
truthfully received them.</p>
<p>1.60. When our most blessed archbishop Unni [d. 936] saw that the
door of the faith had been opened to the gentiles, he gave thanks to God
for the salvation of the pagans, and more especially because the mission
of the church of Hamburg, long neglected on account of the adverse
times, has with the help of God’s mercy and through the valor of King
Henry been given occasion and opportunity for its work. Deeming nothing
hard and laborious if undertaken for Christ, he determined to go in
person through the length and breadth of his diocese. The entire flock
of the church of Bremen followed him, as they say, saddened by the
absence of its good shepherd and ready to go with him both into prison
and to death.</p>
<p>1.61. Thereafter the confessor of God came to the Danes over whom, as
we have said, the most cruel Gorm then held sway. The latter, indeed, he
could not win over on account of his inborn savagery, but he is said by
his preaching to have won the king’s son, Harald [Bluetooth]. Unni made
him so faithful to Christ that, although he himself had not yet received
the sacrament of baptism, he permitted the public profession of
Christianity which his father always hated.</p>
<p>And so, after the saint of God had ordained priests for the several
churches in the kingdom of the Danes, he is said to have commended the
multitude of believers to Harald. Seconded also by his aid and by a
legate, Unni went into all the islands of the Danes, preaching the Word
of God to the heathen and comforting in Christ the faithful whom he
found captive there….</p>
<p>2.3. As soon as he was freed from the plots of his brothers, King
Otto [I of Germany, r. 936–973] with the support of divine help executed
judgment and justice unto his people. Thereupon, after he had brought
into subjection to his empire nearly all the kingdoms which had seceded
after the death of Charles, he took up arms against the Danes, whom his
father had previously subdued by war. Bent upon fighting, they had
murdered at Haddeby Otto’s legates and the margrave and had utterly
wiped out the whole colony of Saxons. To avenge this deed the king at
once invaded Denmark with an army. Crossing the Danish frontier, which
had formerly been fixed at Schleswig, he devastated the whole region
with fire and sword, even unto the furthermost sea which separates the
Northmen from the Danes and which to this very day is called the
Ottensond for the victory of the king [Adam here attributes a campaign
of Otto II in 974 to Otto I]. As he was leaving, Harald [Bluetooth] met
him at Schleswig and offered battle. In this conflict, manfully
contested on both sides, the Saxons gained the victory, and the
vanquished Danes retreated to their ships. When conditions were at
length favorable for peace, Harald submitted to Otto and, on getting
back his kingdom from the latter, promised to receive Christianity into
Denmark. Not long after Harald himself was baptized together with his
wife, Gunnhild, and his little son, whom our king raised up from the
sacred font and named Svein Otto. At that time Denmark on this side of
the sea, which is called Jutland by the inhabitants, was divided into
three dioceses and subjected to the bishopric of Hamburg. In the church
at Bremen are preserved the royal edicts which prove that King Otto held
the Danish kingdom in his jurisdiction, so much so that he would even
bestow the bishoprics. And it can be seen in the privileges of the Roman
See that Pope Agapetus, in congratulating the Church of Hamburg upon the
salvation of the heathen, also conceded to Adaldag everything that had
been granted to the archbishopric of Bremen by his predecessors,
Gregory, Nicholas, Sergius, and others. To him also was conceded by
virtue of apostolic authority the right to consecrate bishops as papal
legates to Denmark as well as to the other peoples of the north.</p>
<p>2.4. Our most blessed father [Archbishop Adaldag], then was the first
to consecrate bishops for Denmark: Hored for Schleswig, Liafdag for
Ribe, Reginbrund for Aarhus. To them he also commended the churches
across the sea in Fyn, Zealand, and Scania and in Sweden. This was done
in the archbishop’s twelfth year [948]. And indeed, such increase
followed these beginnings of heavenly mercy, God working with them, that
the churches of the Danes are seen to abound in the manifold fruits of
the northern peoples from that time even to this day….</p>
<p>2.22. Harald [Bluetooth], the king of the Danes, noted for his piety
and bravery, had long before benignantly admitted Christianity to his
kingdom and held it firm until the end. Hence, also, he strengthened his
rule by holiness and justice and extended his authority beyond the sea
over the Norwegians and the Angles. Emund, Eric’s son, then ruled in
Sweden. Since he was allied with Harald, he was favorably disposed
toward the Christians who came there. In Norway, Haakon [the Bad, ca
971–995] was the ruler. When the Norwegians drove him from the realm
because he had acted haughtily, Harald valorously restored him and made
him well-disposed to the worshippers of Christ….</p>
