<h4 id="b-vigdis-divorces-thord-goddi">(b) Vigdis Divorces Thord
Goddi</h4>
<p>When a relative, Thorolf, seeks Vigdis’s protection from the
consequences of a murder, her husband, Thord, fails to act as she thinks
a man ought to, and she declares herself divorced from him, in this
selection from The Saga of the People of Laxdale.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 30–37.</p>
<ol start="14" type="1">
<li>…The news of Hall’s murder spread throughout the islands and was
taken very seriously because, although he was not a lucky man, Hall
belonged to a noble family. Now Thorolf fled from the islands, for he
knew no one there who would shelter him after such a terrible deed. He
had no relatives from whom he could hope for protection, whereas there
were powerful men in the neighborhood who could certainly be expected to
plot against his life, men like Ingjald the Godi [chieftain] of the
South Islands, the brother of Hall.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thorolf got a passage to the mainland. He traveled wearing a large
hood on his head and there is no account of his journey until he arrived
at Goddastead one evening. Vigdis, the wife of Thord, was some sort of
relation of Thorolf’s and that is why he turned up at that house.
Thorolf had already heard about how things stood there, in particular
that Vigdis was more tough-minded than her husband Thord. On the evening
of his arrival, Thorolf went straight to tell Vigdis his troubles and
ask for her help.</p>
<p>Vigdis gave him this answer: “I won’t deny our kinship, and what you
have done does not seem to me to have made a worse man of you. I think
that anyone who protects you will risk both his life and property
considering the stature of the men who will be in pursuit of you. But,”
she said, “my husband Thord isn’t much of a fighting man, and the advice
of us women is always wanting in judgment, if anything is needed. But I
can’t bring myself to turn you away out of hand, since you have decided
to come here for help.”</p>
<p>After that, Vigdis led him to a farm building and told him to stay
there. She locked the door when she left. Later, she approached Thord.
“A man has come here looking for a place to stay for the night,” she
said. “His name is Thorolf, and he has some sort of kinship with me. I
think that he will need to stay for longer, if you’re willing.”</p>
<p>Thord answered that he didn’t like having people to visit, but said
that he could stay for the next day, so long as he wasn’t in trouble.
Otherwise he should be on his way as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Vigdis answered, “I have already offered to let him stay and I won’t
go back on my word even though he may not be equally friendly with
everyone.”</p>
<p>Then she told him about the murder of Hall and that his murderer,
Thorolf, was the man who had arrived at their house. Thord was angry
about this, and said that he knew for certain that Ingjald would make
him pay heavily for the protection already given to Thorolf, now that
the door had been locked behind him.</p>
<p>“Ingjald won’t take your money for giving Thorolf one night’s
shelter,” said Vigdis, “because he’s staying here for the whole
winter.”</p>
<p>“You can trump me completely, but I’m really annoyed that such an
unlucky man is here,” complained Thord. Nonetheless, Thorolf stayed
there over the winter.</p>
<p>This reached the ears of Ingjald, who was prosecuting his brother’s
murder. Ingjald got ready for his journey to the Dales district in late
winter and launched a ferry that he owned. He and eleven others sailed
from the west before a sharp north-westerly wind and landed at the mouth
of the Lax river in the evening. They beached the ferry and traveled to
Goddastead during the evening. Their arrival was expected and they
received a warm welcome.</p>
<p>Ingjald drew Thord aside for a talk and told him his business, saying
that he had heard that his brother’s killer, Thorolf, was there, but
Thord denied that this was so. Ingjald told him not to deny it.</p>
<p>“Let’s make a deal,” he said, “You give up the man to me and save me
trouble and I’ve got three marks of silver here for you in return. And I
won’t prosecute the charges you have brought on yourself by sheltering
Thorolf.”</p>
<p>Thord thought the money looked good and there was also the promise of
the abandonment of the charges, which he had greatly feared would lead
to a serious loss of property. “I know that I’ll be criticized by people
because of our dealings, but our bargain will stand,” said Thord. They
slept for much of the night until an hour before day.</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>Then Ingjald and his men got up and dressed. Vigdis asked Thord what
he and Ingjald had been talking about during the evening. He replied
that they had discussed a lot, and had agreed that the place should be
ransacked, so they would be out of trouble if Thorolf wasn’t found. “So
I had my slave Asgaut take him away,” said Thord.</li>
</ol>
<p>Vigdis said that she had no time for lying and declared that she
didn’t fancy having Ingjald poking about in her house, but told him to
get on with it. Ingjald ransacked the place, but didn’t find Thorolf
there. At that moment Asgaut came up and Vigdis asked him where he had
parted from Thorolf. “I took him to the sheep-house as Thord told me
to,” replied Asgaut.</p>
<p>“Could anything be closer to Ingjald’s path when he returns to his
ship?” said Vigdis. “I’m not going to take the risk that this is what
they cooked up yesterday evening. I want you to go right now and take
him to Saudafel to meet Thorolf Raudnef [a different Thorolf]. If you do
as I ask you, there will be something in it for you. I’ll give you your
freedom and some money so that you will be able to go wherever you
want.” Asgaut was all for this and went to the sheep-house where he
found Thorolf and told him to get away as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>At that moment Ingjald was riding away from Goddastead intent on
getting his money’s worth and when he had come down from the farm, he
and his men saw two men walking toward them: they were Asgaut and
Thorolf. It was early in the morning, so there wasn’t much daylight.
Asgaut and Thorolf had got themselves into a very tight spot, with
Ingjald on one side, and the Lax river on the other. The river was in
flood and there were huge masses of ice on both sides, but the middle of
the river was flowing and it looked dangerous to cross.</p>
<p>“We seem to have two choices facing us,” said Thorolf to Asgaut.
“First, we could wait for them here beside the river and defend
ourselves as long as our resolve and courage hold out, but it’s more
than likely that Ingjald and his men will kill us straight off. The
other choice is to try the river, and that seems to have its own risks.”
Asgaut told Thorolf to decide, and declared that he wouldn’t part from
him now, whatever he decided to do. “Let’s head for the river,” said
Thorolf.</p>
<p>They did this and lightened their equipment as much as possible.
After that, they climbed down to the masses of ice and threw themselves
into the water. Because these men were brave, and longer life was in
their destiny, they managed to cross the river and climbed up onto the
heaped ice on the other side. They were no sooner across than Ingjald
and his followers reached the side of the river. Ingjald addressed his
men: “What are we going to do? Will we try the river or not?” They told
him to decide and said that they would trust his judgment, though the
river seemed impassable to them. “We’ll turn back and leave the river
alone,” said Ingjald.</p>
<p>When Thorolf and Asgaut saw that Ingjald and his men were not going
to attempt the crossing, they wrung out their clothes first of all and
got ready for their journey. They walked all day and in the evening
reached Saudafell where they had a warm welcome beacause anyone was
allowed to stay there overnight. In the course of the evening, Asgaut
went to see Thorolf Raudnef and outlined to him all the circumstances of
their errand. He explained to Thorolf Raudnef that the man who had
arrived with him had been sent there by his kinswoman Vigdis for support
and protection. He gave an account of all that had gone on between Thord
Goddi and his wife and presented the identification sent by Vigdis to
Thorolf Raudnef.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to question this identification,” said Thorolf
Raudnef. “Of course I’ll take in this man at Vigdis’s request. I think
she has behaved courageously in this business, and it’s a great pity
that a woman like her has made such a wretched marriage. Asgaut, you can
stay here as long as you like.”</p>
<p>Asgaut replied that he wouldn’t stay there any longer. Then Thorolf
Raudnef received his namesake and made him one of his followers. Thorolf
and Asgaut parted as good friends and Asgaut made his way home.</p>
<p>As for Ingjald, he turned back to Goddastead when he and Thorolf had
parted company. By that time, no fewer than forty-two men from
neighboring farms had shown up at the request of Vigdis. When Ingjald
and his men got back to the farm, Ingjald called Thord over to him.</p>
<p>“You haven’t behaved like a gentleman about our agreement,” said
Ingjald. “We know for sure that you got the man away.” Thord replied
that he truly had no part in the affair, but the whole story of the
agreement between Ingjald and Thord came out. Now Ingjald wanted to get
back the money he had given to Thord. Vigdis was standing nearby during
their conversation and remarked that they had got what they deserved.
She told Thord it was unmanly to keep the money. “Because, Thord, you
got hold of the money dishonorably,” she said. Thord said that she
should do whatever she wanted with it.</p>
<p>With that, she went indoors to Thord’s chest and found a fat
money-bag at the bottom of it. She picked up the bag and took it out to
Ingjald and told him to take the money. Ingjald brightened up with that
and stretched out his hand toward the money-bag. Vigdis heaved up the
bag and struck him on the nose with it, and immediately his blood gushed
to the ground. Along with the bag, she hurled a few choice epithets at
him, said that he would never get his money back again, and told him to
be on his way. Ingjald saw that the best idea was to be off as soon as
he could and that’s what he did, without stopping till he got home. He
wasn’t happy about his trip.</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>As soon as Asgaut got back home, Vigdis gave him a warm welcome and
asked him how good the hospitality had been at Saudafell. He reported
that it had been excellent and repeated Thorolf Raudnef’s parting words
to her. She was very pleased about that and said to Asgaut,</li>
</ol>
<p>“You have shown real guts and loyalty, and I’ll tell you right now
what your reward is going to be: I am giving you your freedom, and from
today you will be called a free man; you will have the money Thord
accepted in return for the life of my kinsman; the money has found a
better home.” [The grateful Asgaut moves to Denmark where he becomes a
successful farmer.]…</p>
<p>Vigdis felt such hostility because of the plot between Ingjald and
Thord Goddi that she declared herself divorced from Thord. She went back
to her relatives and told them what had happened. Thord Gellir, their
chief, was not happy about the divorce, but there was no fuss. Vigdis
took no more from Goddistead than her own valuables. The people of Hvamm
announced that they intended to take half the property owned by Thord
Goddi….</p>
