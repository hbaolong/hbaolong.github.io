<h4 id="the-death-of-thormod-kolbrunarskald">87. The Death of Thormod
Kolbrunarskald</h4>
<p>Olaf Haraldsson (Saint Olaf; 995–1030), was king of Norway from 1015
to 1028, and he unified the kingdom more effectively than Harald
Finehair had been able to do. His harshness brought rebellion in 1028,
and his attempt to regain the throne ended with his defeat and death at
the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Before the battle, the king called the
poet Thormod Kolbrunarskald to sing for him. Thormod did so and stayed
by the king until his death. The following passage relates Thormod’s own
death.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Óláfs saga
Helga, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk fornrit
XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 2, pp. 389–93.</p>
<ol start="233" type="1">
<li>In the battle, Thormod Kolbrunarskald stayed near King Olaf’s
banner. After the death of the king when the battle was at its fiercest,
the men of the king’s guard fell one beside the other, and most of those
left standing were wounded. Thormod, too, was seriously wounded and,
like all the others, retreated from the thick of the battle. Some even
fled.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now the fight called Dag’s Attack broke out, and all of the king’s
men who were able to bear arms went there. Thormod, however, did not
take part in the fray. He could not fight, because of his wounds and his
weariness, but he stood beside his comrades though he could do nothing
else. He was then struck in the left side by an arrow. He broke off the
shaft of the arrow and walked away from the battle, back to the houses.
He came to a barn, which was a large building. Thormod was carrying a
drawn sword in his hand and as he went in a man coming out met him and
said,</p>
<p>“There is a terrible noise of wailing and howling in here. It’s a
real disgrace that strong men can’t bear their wounds. The king’s men
may well have advanced bravely today, but they endure their wounds very
badly.”</p>
<p>Thormod answered, “What’s your name?” The man said his name was
Kimbi. “Were you in the battle?” asked Thormod.</p>
<p>“I was with the farmers,” he replied, “the better side.” “Are you
wounded at all?” asked Thormod. “Slightly,” said Kimbi. “Were you in the
battle?” “I was with those who had the best of it,” said Thormod.</p>
<p>Kimbi saw that Thormod had a gold ring on his arm. He said, “You must
be one of the king’s men. Give me your gold ring and I’ll hide you. The
farmers will kill you if you get in their way.”</p>
<p>“Take the ring if you can,” answered Thormod. “I have lost more than
that.”</p>
<p>Kimbi stretched out his hand to take the ring. Thormod swung his
sword and cut off Kimbi’s hand. The story goes that Kimbi bore his wound
no better than those whom he had criticized earlier.</p>
<p>Kimbi went away, but Thormod sat down in the barn for a while and
listened to what people were saying. The talk was chiefly about what
each of them had seen in the battle and about the bravery of the men
involved. Some praised the courage of King Olaf most, while others
mentioned other equally brave men. Then Thormod recited:</p>
<p>Brave-hearted Olaf made a bloody advance</p>
<p>at Stiklestad. Sword thrust</p>
<p>and steel spear bit.</p>
<p>The king urged bold warriors to battle.</p>
<p>I saw all the tree-tall warriors of Odin</p>
<p>—except the courageous king—</p>
<p>seek to shelter from the spear-shower,</p>
<p>where most met a terrible trial.</p>
<ol start="234" type="1">
<li>Thormod left and entered a small building where there were already
many badly wounded men. A woman was also there, bandaging up their
wounds. On the floor a fire was burning, and she was heating water on it
to cleanse the wounds. Thormod sat down beside the door. Men were coming
and going as they cared for the wounded. One of them turned to Thormod,
looked at him, and said, “Why are you so pale? Are you wounded? Why
don’t you ask for treatment?” Thormod recited this poem:</li>
</ol>
<p>Red I am not, but red and</p>
<p>ruddy health in a man</p>
<p>is what the slim, fair woman prefers.</p>
<p>Few are troubled by my wounds.</p>
<p>What caused this pallor,</p>
<p>Generous gold-giver?</p>
<p>Danish weapons that slashed deep</p>
<p>and a hail of arrows that smarted.</p>
<p>Then Thormod stood up and walked over to the fire. He stood there for
a while until the woman said to him, “You, fellow, go out and bring me
the firewood that’s lying outside the door.” He went out and brought in
an armful of wood which he threw on the floor. The woman looked at his
face and said, “This man is very pale. Why are you so pale?” Thormod
recited:</p>
<p>My paleness surprises you,</p>
<p>swan-white woman.</p>
<p>Few grow fair from wounds;</p>
<p>I faced the arrows’ storm.</p>
<p>The pliant weapon, propelled with force,</p>
<p>pierced me through.</p>
<p>I fear that danger-carrying iron bit keenly,</p>
<p>close to my heart.</p>
<p>Then the woman said, “Let me see your wounds and I’ll bandage them.”
He sat down and took off his clothes. When she had seen his wounds, the
woman examined the one in his side. She noticed that there was a piece
of iron buried in it, but she did not know for certain how far it had
penetrated. In a stone pot she had mashed together garlic and other
herbs. She boiled them up and gave them to the wounded men to eat. In
this way, she found out if they had been wounded in a vital part for she
could smell the scent of garlic coming from a wound in a body cavity.
She brought the mixture to Thormod and told him to eat. He replied,
“Take it away. I’m not so sick that I want broth.”</p>
<p>Then she picked up a pair of tongs and tried to remove the iron, but
it was stuck fast and would not budge because the wound had swollen up
and there wasn’t much iron sticking out to get hold of. Thormod said,
“Cut through to the iron so that the tongs can grip it easily. Then give
me the tongs and let me pull it out.”</p>
<p>She did as he asked. Then Thormod took a gold ring from his arm and
gave it to the woman and told her to do what she liked with it. “It is a
fine gift,” he said. “King Olaf gave me the ring this morning.”</p>
<p>Thormod took the tongs and pulled out the arrow-head, which was
barbed. On the barbs were shreds of flesh from his heart, some red and
some white. When he saw that, he said, “Our king has fed us well: I have
fat even around my heart.” Then he slumped back and died. Here ends what
there is to say about Thormod.</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve</p>
<hr />
<p>From Odin to Christ</p>
<p>The conversion of the Scandinavians was a lengthy and complicated
process that spanned virtually the entire Viking Age. It was by no means
a linear process: it occurred earlier in some regions than others, and
moved at different paces in different parts of the Viking world. Saint
Anskar (d. 865), known as the “Apostle of the North,” was active in
Denmark and Sweden in the early ninth century, and other missionaries
are also known, but the success of these early missions is difficult to
gauge. Documentary sources suggest that a crucial phase in the
conversion process occurred when rulers in Scandinavia opted to convert
from the mid-tenth century onward; the extent to which the sources are
to be trusted on this matter is, however, a subject of considerable
debate. (Archaeological evidence, outside the scope of this book, points
to a rather different story in some regions.) By the twelfth century,
however, the process had largely run its course in most parts of the
Scandinavian world and the Vikings had joined the mainstream of
Christian European peoples. Vikings became Crusaders and pilgrims, and
those who had once attacked churches and monasteries became soldiers of
Christ, or undertook pilgrimages from Scandinavia to Christendom’s
holiest places.</p>
<p>One significant problem with understanding conversion relates to the
nature of the sources. There is no coherent contemporary narrative of
the conversion of the Northern peoples, no Scandinavian equivalent to
Bede’s Ecclesiastical History of the English People (731), to guide any
examination. Few contemporary sources come to us from Scandina-vians,
and those that do exist are mostly from Christian writers such as
Rimbert or Adam of Bremen, outsiders looking in, who were hardly
unbiased observers. What Scandinavian sources there are were largely
composed long after conversion, though this does not automatically make
them untrustworthy. A related difficulty is that these texts are
unevenly distributed across the Viking world: sources for the conversion
are sparse in places such as Ireland, Scotland, Normandy, Russia, and
Greenland, while in Scandinavia itself, Denmark and Norway are better
documented than Sweden.</p>
<p>Another set of problems relates to the nature of conversion as a
whole: how much was conversion motivated by conscience or genuine piety,
and how much by other factors, social, political, or economic?
Conversion was, for instance, closely associated with the state-building
process: the Scandinavian kings who were remembered as being responsible
for conversion are also regarded as being responsible for constructing
unitary kingships in their realms. Some of the materials presented in
chapter 13 on state-building—the royal monuments at Jelling in Denmark,
for instance (see doc. 101)—are therefore as relevant to the theme of
conversion as they are to state-making.</p>
