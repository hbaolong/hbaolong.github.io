<h4 id="the-battle-of-clontarf-1014">107. The Battle of Clontarf,
1014</h4>
<p>The Battle of Clontarf was fought on Good Friday (23 April) 1014, in
what is now a suburb of Dublin. The combatants were the Irish High King
Brian Boru, with his Munster army, opposed by an alliance of Sigtrygg
Silkenbeard of Dublin, Máelmórda mac Murchada of Leinster, and Sigurd
Hlodvisson of the Orkneys, with forces drawn from the Orkneys, Hebrides,
Isle of Man, and northern England, as well as Dublin and Leinster. The
battle had its roots in a rebellion against Brian’s ascendancy. The
battle has long been regarded as significant for breaking Viking power
in Ireland—a view prevalent since the Middle Ages, and fostered by the
Cogad Gáedel re Gallaib (The War of the Irish against the Foreigners
[see doc. 45])—but modern scholars are inclined to regard it as an Irish
political struggle into which Scandinavians were drawn on both sides.
From Njal’s Saga. Several of the men involved with the burning of Njal
died in this battle.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 444–60.</p>
<ol start="155" type="1">
<li>…Then King Sigtrygg got down to business and asked Earl Sigurd to
join forces with him against King Brian. The earl resisted the idea for
a long time, but in the end he agreed on condition that he could marry
Sigtrygg’s mother and become king of Ireland if they killed Brian. His
men all tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. And so they parted
company with Earl Sigurd promising to join the expedition, and King
Sigtrygg promising him his mother and the kingdom. It was also agreed
that Earl Sigurd would come to Dublin with his entire army on Palm
Sunday.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sigtrygg traveled south to Ireland and told his mother that the earl
had undertaken to join them; he told her, too, what he had promised in
return. She expressed her approval but declared that they would have to
muster a much larger force. Sygtrygg asked where this was to come from.
“There are two Vikings lying off the Isle of Man with thirty ships,”
replied Kormlod [Sygtrygg’s mother]. “One of them is called Ospak and
the other Brodir and they are so fierce that no one can stand up to
them. Go and find them and do your best to persuade them to join you,
whatever their conditions.”</p>
<p>Sigtrygg went looking for the Vikings and found them off the Isle of
Man. He brought up the reason for his visit at once, but Brodir declined
to get involved until King Sigtrygg promised him the kingdom and his
mother. This arrangement was to be kept secret so that Earl Sigurd
wouldn’t find out about it, and Brodir, too, was to come to Dublin on
Palm Sunday. Then Sigtrygg went home to his mother and told her
everything.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Brodir and Ospak conferred together, and Brodir told
Ospak all about his conversation with Sigtrygg. He asked Ospak to join
him in the war against King Brian, saying that he had a great deal
riding on it. Ospak replied that he did not want to fight against such a
good king. Both of them grew very angry; they divided up their forces,
with Ospak taking ten ships and Brodir twenty.</p>
<p>Ospak was a heathen and the wisest of men. He steered his ships into
the bay while Brodir lay at anchor outside it. Brodir had been a
Christian and an ordained deacon, but he had abandoned his faith and
renounced God. Now he sacrificed to heathen devils. He was more skilled
in sorcery than anyone else and had a mail shirt which no weapon could
pierce. He was a big, strong man and his black hair was so long that he
could tuck it under his belt.</p>
<ol start="156" type="1">
<li>One night a great din broke out above Brodir and his men. Awakened
by the noise, they all leapt up and got dressed. Then, along with the
din, came a shower of boiling blood. They protected themselves against
it with their shields, but many of them were scalded. This strange
happening lasted until daybreak, and one man died on every ship. Then
they slept for the rest of the day.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next night, the noise returned and once more they all sprang up.
This time swords leapt out of their sheaths, and axes and spears flew up
into the air above them and started fighting. The weapons attacked the
men so fiercely that they had to use their shields for protection, but
many of them were wounded and again one man died on every ship. This
wonder went on till dawn and once again they slept all the next day.</p>
<p>On the third night, the uproar erupted again. This time, ravens came
flying down at the men, attacking them so fiercely with their iron-like
beaks and claws that the men had to defend themselves with their swords
and protect themselves with their shields. This onslaught continued
until daybreak, and again, one man died on every ship. Then they
slept.</p>
<p>When Brodir awoke, he sighed deeply, and ordered his men to launch a
boat, saying that he wanted to see his foster-brother, Ospak. He boarded
the boat with some of his men, and when he met Ospak, he told him about
all the strange things that had happened to them and asked him to
explain their significance. Ospak refused to tell him until he had
agreed to a truce. Brodir gave his word, but, even then, Ospak put off
telling him until nightfall, for Brodir never killed at night.</p>
<p>Then Ospak said: “When the blood rained down on you, it was a sign
that you will shed a great deal of blood, both your own and other men’s.
When you heard a great noise, it was a sign that the world is falling
apart, and you will all die soon. When the weapons attacked you, they
portended a battle. And when the ravens flew at you it was a sign that
the devils you trusted will drag you down to the torments of hell.”</p>
<p>Brodir was too enraged to speak. He rushed back to his men and had
them line up his ships across the sound and moor them to the shore with
cables. He intended to kill Ospak and all his men next morning. When
Ospak saw what they were doing, he swore to adopt Christianity and join
King Brian and follow him to the death. He came up with a plan to
camouflage his ships and have them poled along the shore so that his men
could cut the mooring cables of Brodir’s ships. The ships then drifted
into one another while the crews slept. Meanwhile, Ospak and his men
sailed out of the fjord and went west to Ireland; they did not stop
until they reached Kincora. There, Ospak told King Brian everything he
had learned. He accepted baptism from the king and entered his service.
King Brian then mustered troops from all over his kingdom; this army was
to come to Dublin the week before Palm Sunday.</p>
<ol start="157" type="1">
<li>Earl Sigurd Hlodvisson got ready to leave the Orkneys. Flosi
[responsible for the burning of Njal] volunteered to go with him, but
the earl would not hear of it because Flosi had still to make his
pilgrimage to Rome. So Flosi volunteered fifteen of his men for the
expedition, and the earl accepted his offer. Then Flosi went with Earl
Gilli to the Hebrides, while Thorstein Hallsson, Hrafn the Red, and
Erling of Straumey went with Earl Sigurd to Ireland. The earl did not
want Harek to go with him, but promised he would be the first to hear
what happened.</li>
</ol>
<p>On Palm Sunday, Earl Sigurd and his entire army arrived in Dublin.
Brodir and his troops were there already. Brodir tried to predict how
the battle would go by means of sorcery. His prediction was that if the
battle took place on Good Friday, King Brian would be killed though he
would win the victory, and if the battle took place before Good Friday,
all Brian’s opponents would be killed. So Brodir advised them not to
fight before Friday.</p>
<p>On the Thursday of that week, a man with a halberd in his hand rode
up on a dapple-grey horse. He had a long talk with Brodir and Kormlod
[the mother of Sigtrygg].</p>
<p>King Brian and his troops reached Dublin, and, on Good Friday, the
Norse army came out of the town and both sides drew up in battle
formation. Brodir was on one wing of the army and Sigtrygg was on the
other, with Sigurd in the middle. King Brian was unwilling to fight on
Good Friday, so a shield wall was thrown up around him and his army was
drawn up in front of it. Ulf the Unruly was in the wing facing Brodir,
while Ospak and King Brian’s sons were on the other wing facing
Sigtrygg. Kerthjalfad was in the centre and in front of him were the
standards.</p>
<p>Now the two armies fell upon one another and a ferocious battle
ensued. Brodir charged through the opposing ranks, killing everyone in
his path; no weapons could harm him. Then Ulf the Unruly turned toward
him and struck him three times with such force that he fell on his face
each time and could scarcely get up again. As soon as he regained his
footing, he fled into the forest.</p>
<p>Earl Sigurd had a hard fight against Kerthjalfad who advanced so
forcefully that he killed everyone before him. He fought his way right
through Earl Sigurd’s force as far as the standard and killed the
standard bearer. The earl got another man to carry the standard and the
battle continued just as fiercely. Kerthjalfad immediately cut down the
replacement standard-bearer. Then he killed all those who were near him,
one after another. Earl Sigurd ordered Thorstein Hallsson to carry the
standard, and Thorstein was just about to pick it up when Amund the
White said: “Don’t touch the standard, Thorstein. Everyone who carries
it is killed.”</p>
<p>“You carry the standard,” said the earl to Hrafn the Red.</p>
<p>“Carry the accursed thing yourself,” replied Hrafn.</p>
<p>“You’re right,” said the earl. “A beggar should carry his own bag.”
So he took the standard from its pole and put it under his clothes.
Shortly afterwards, Amund the White was killed, and then the earl, too,
was skewered by a spear.</p>
<p>Ospak had fought his way through the opposing wing; he was badly
wounded, and Brian’s sons were both dead. King Sigtrygg fled before him
and after that the whole Norse army took to flight. But while everyone
else was running away, Thorstein Hallsson stopped to tie his shoelace.
When Kerthjalfad asked him why he wasn’t running away, Thorstein
replied, “Because I won’t make it home this evening since I live out in
Iceland.” Kerthjalfad spared his life.</p>
<p>Hrafn the Red was pursued into a river. He thought he could see the
torments of hell below him and devils threatening to drag him down, so
he said, “Saint Peter, this dog of yours has run to Rome twice already,
and will run there a third time if you let him.”</p>
<p>Then the devils let him go, and he got across the river.</p>
<p>Brodir saw that King Brian’s army was in hot pursuit of the fleeing
soldiers and that there was hardly anyone near the shield wall. So he
ran out of the woods, broke through the shield wall, and struck at King
Brian. The boy Tatk thrust his arm in the way, but the stroke cut off
his arm and the king’s head too. The king’s blood splashed onto the
stump of Tatk’s arm, and it healed immediately. Then Brodir shouted
loudly, “Spread the word. Brodir has killed Brian.”</p>
<p>Some men sped off and told the pursuing troops that King Brian had
fallen. Ulf the Unruly and Kerthjalfad turned back at once. They
surrounded Brodir and his men, threw tree branches over them, and took
Brodir prisoner. Ulf the Unruly cut open his stomach and unwound his
entrails by leading him round and round an oak tree. He did not die
until all of his guts were pulled out. Brodir’s men were all killed
too.</p>
<p>When they took King Brian’s body to prepare it for burial, they found
that his head had grown back onto his body. Fifteen of the men who had
taken part in the burning of Njal died in Brian’s Battle. Halldor
Gudmundarson and Erling of Straumey fell there too.</p>
<p>On that Good Friday morning, a strange thing happened in Caithness. A
man called Darrud went out and saw twelve figures riding toward a cabin
and disappearing inside. He went over to the cabin and looked through a
window. He saw that there were women inside and they had set up a loom.
Its weights were men’s heads; its weft and warp were men’s entrails; the
slay was a sword, and the rod was an arrow. The women were reciting
these verses:</p>
<p>“Darradarljod” (“Song of the Spear”)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Wide is the warp</li>
</ol>
<p>of slaughtered souls,</p>
<p>blood rains red</p>
<p>from the cloth-cloud;</p>
<p>now Valkyries weave</p>
<p>a web of war,</p>
<p>and fill out</p>
<p>this warp of warriors,</p>
<p>grey like spear-steel,</p>
<p>with a red weft.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The web is warped</li>
</ol>
<p>with human guts</p>
<p>the warp is weighted</p>
<p>with human heads;</p>
<p>blood-spattered spears are</p>
<p>the heddle rods, the shed rod</p>
<p>is bound with iron bands,</p>
<p>the shuttle is shaped from arrows;</p>
<p>with our sword-beaters we strike</p>

<ol start="4" type="1">

<p>I say death will be dealt</p>
<p>to a powerful prince;</p>
<p>an earl will fall to earth</p>
<p>pierced by spear points.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>The Irish will endure</li>
</ol>
<p>everlasting anguish;</p>
<p>that woe will not wane</p>
<p>however long men live;</p>
<p>the web is now woven,</p>
<p>the battlefield blood red;</p>
<p>tidings of death and disaster</p>
<p>will spread from land to land.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Now it is loathsome</li>
</ol>
<p>to look around as</p>
<p>clouds, crimson with blood,</p>
<p>spread over the sky;</p>
<p>the high heavens will be</p>
<p>deep-died with men’s blood,</p>
<p>when the women of war [the Valkyries]</p>
<p>sing their songs.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>We have spoken fine words</li>
</ol>
<p>concerning the young king,</p>
<p>we have sung him songs</p>
<p>of victory, Valkyries’ songs.</p>
<p>Let him who hears</p>
<p>the songs of the spear-women</p>
<p>listen and learn,</p>
<p>and teach them to others.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>Let us leave here,</li>
</ol>
<p>ride away rapidly</p>
<p>on barebacked horses</p>
<p>with swords unsheathed.</p>
<p>Then the women pulled down the cloth and tore it to shreds; each of
them kept the piece she was holding. Darrud left the window and made his
way home and the women mounted their horses and rode off, six to the
south and the other six to the north. A similar event was witnessed by
Brand Gneistason in the Faeroes.</p>
<p>At Svinafell in Iceland, blood fell onto the priest’s cope on Good
Friday and he had to take it off. At Thvatt River on Good Friday, the
priest thought he saw a deep sea beside the altar with many terrifying
things in it; it was a long time before he could say his prayers
again.</p>
<p>And this is what happened in the Orkneys. Harek thought he saw Earl
Sigurd and some of his men. So he mounted his horse and rode to meet the
earl. People saw them meeting and riding behind a hill, but they were
never seen again, and not a trace of Harek was ever found.</p>
<p>In the Hebrides, Earl Gilli dreamt that a man came to him, saying
that his name was Herfinn and that he had come from Ireland. The earl
asked him what news there was from Ireland, and he answered thus:</p>
<p>I was there, in Ireland,</p>
<p>when brave men battled;</p>
<p>swords sang out, shield met shield,</p>
<p>weapons clashed in the din of war;</p>
<p>I heard the fighting was fierce;</p>
<p>Sigurd fell in the spear-storm,</p>
<p>battle-wounds bled,</p>
<p>Brian fell but won the field.</p>
<p>Flosi and the earl spent a good deal of time talking about this
dream.</p>
<p>A week later, Hrafn the Red arrived and told them what had happened
at the Battle of Clontarf. He told them about the deaths of King Brian,
and Earl Sigurd, and Brodir, and all the Vikings.</p>
<p>“What can you tell me about my men?” asked Flosi.</p>
<p>“They all died,” replied Hrafn, “except for your brother-in-law
Thorstein. He was spared by Kerthjalfad and is with him now. Halldor
Gudmundarson died there too.”</p>
