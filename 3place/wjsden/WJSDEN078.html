<h4 id="the-martyrdom-of-saint-edmund">52. The Martyrdom of Saint
Edmund</h4>
<p>In 869, King Edmund of East Anglia was martyred by the Great Army
under the leadership of Ivar the Boneless and Ubbi, sons of Ragnar
Hairy-Breeches.The event was noted in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle (see
above), but the saint’s life was written by Abbo, abbot of Fleury (ca
945–1014), and translated into elegant English prose by Ælfric, abbot of
Eynsham (ca 955–1010), an Anglo-Saxon scholar and teacher second only to
Bede.</p>
<p>Source: Ælfric of Eynsham, “The Passion of Saint Edmund, King and
Martyr,” Ælfric’s Lives of Saints, 4 vols, ed. Walter W. Skeat (Oxford:
EETS O.S. 76, 82, 94, 114: repr. in 2 vols. 1966), repr. vol. 2,
pp. 314–28.</p>
<p>In the time of King Athelred [Athelred II, the Unready = having no
policy: ca 968–1016] a very learned monk came north across the sea from
Fleury (Saint Benedict’s Abbey) to visit Archbishop Dunstan [ca 909–May
19, 988] three years before he died. The monk was named Abbo.</p>
<p>At one point in their conversations, Dunstan told the tale of Saint
Edmund [king of East Anglia ca 855–869] exactly as Edmund’s sword-bearer
had narrated it to King Athelred. At that time, Dunstan was a young man,
and the sword-bearer was very old. The monk recorded the whole story in
a book, and when the book came to us a few years later, we translated it
into English, just as it is here. Within a couple of years, the monk,
Abbo, returned to his monastery and shortly afterwards was appointed
abbot there.</p>
<p>The blessed Edmund, king of East Anglia, was a wise and worthy man
who always honored almighty God with his noble behaviour. He was humble
and virtuous and so single-minded in his perseverance that he would not
stoop to disgraceful vices and never deviated from the straight and
narrow in his habits. He was always mindful of the true teaching: “If
you are appointed as a ruler, do not exalt yourself but be a man among
men, no different from the others.”</p>
<p>He was like a kind father to the poor and to widows; with good will
he always guided his people toward righteousness and rebuked the cruel,
leading his life blessedly in the true faith.</p>
<p>In the course of time, the Danish people arrived with a fleet to
plunder and kill far and wide throughout the land as is their custom
[868–869]. The leading men in the fleet were Hinguar [ON Ívarr: known as
Ivar the Boneless; d. ca 873] and Hubba [ON Ubbi: d. 878?; both sons of
Ragnar Hairy-Breeches], united by the devil. They brought their ships to
land in Northumbria, devastated the country, and slaughtered the people.
After they had won a savage victory, Hinguar turned east with his ships
while Hubba stayed on in Northumbria. Hinguar rowed to East Anglia in
the twenty-first year of Alfred atheling [prince] who later became the
renowned king of Wessex [r. 871–899]. Swiftly, this Hinguar stole like a
wolf into the land, murdering the people—men, women, and innocent
children—and shamefully persecuting the blameless Christians.
Immediately afterwards, he sent a threatening message to King Edmund,
demanding his submission if he valued his life. The messenger approached
King Edmund and delivered Hinguar’s message boldly:</p>
<p>“Hinguar our king—courageous and victorious by sea and land, the
ruler of many peoples—has arrived suddenly with his army in this country
where he and his host intend to take up winter quarters. He commands you
immediately to share with him your hidden hoards of gold and your
ancestral treasures and to be his under-king, if you want to stay alive,
for you haven’t the strength to stand up to him.”</p>
<p>King Edmund, however, called on a bishop who was very close to him
and debated with him what answer to give the ferocious Hinguar. The
bishop was terrified by the sudden emergency and, fearing for the king’s
life, said that he thought it would be advisable to yield to Hinguar’s
demands. The king gazed silently at the ground; at length he replied as
a king should:</p>
<p>“Look here, bishop, the people of this country have been shamefully
abused and I would rather die in battle if they could retain their land
as a result.”</p>
<p>“But, my dear king,” replied the bishop, “your people lie shattered
and you don’t have the forces to fight with. These pirates will come and
capture you alive unless you save your life either by running away or by
submitting to Hinguar.”</p>
<p>Then—bravest of men as he was—King Edmund responded:</p>
<p>“In my heart I have absolutely no desire to survive my beloved thanes
who were slaughtered in their beds by these pirates without warning,
along with their wives and children. It has never been my habit to run
away and I would sooner die for my homeland if necessary. God knows that
I will never turn away from worshiping him, nor from truly loving him
whether I live or die.”</p>
<p>With these words, he turned to Hinguar’s messenger and addressed him
fearlessly:</p>
<p>“Truly, you deserve to be slaughtered on the spot, but I won’t dirty
my clean hands with your foul blood because I follow Christ, who taught
us by example. I will happily die at your hands if that is what God
ordains. Go quickly and say to your cruel lord: ‘While he lives, Edmund
will never yield to Hinguar, the heathen warlord, unless he submits in
this country to Christ the Saviour and his faith.’”</p>
<p>The messenger went on his way and on the road he met the murderous
Hinguar hastening with his entire army to find Edmund. The messenger
told the impious Dane what Edmund’s answer was, and Hinguar angrily
ordered his forces to look for the king in particular and to secure him
immediately.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when Hinguar arrived, Edmund was standing in his hall,
thinking of the Savior. He discarded his weapons as he wished to imitate
the example of Christ, who forbade Peter to use weapons against the
cruel Jews. So the unbelievers bound Edmund and mocked and insulted him,
and beat him with canes. After that they led the pious king to a firmly
rooted tree and bound him to it tightly. Then they scourged him with
whips for a long time. Between the blows, he called on Christ the Savior
with unshaken faith. The heathens were infuriated by his faith as he
called on Christ to help him. Then, for fun, they threw spears at him
till their missiles covered him like the bristles of a hedgehog, as also
befell Saint Sebastian.</p>
<p>Then the unbelieving pirate, Hinguar, realized that the noble king
would not renounce Christ since Edmund constantly called on Him with
unswerving faith. Hinguar gave orders for Edmund to be beheaded, and the
heathens did this. Even while he was still calling on Christ, the
heathens dragged the saint to the slaughter. With one blow they struck
off his head, and his blessed soul departed to Christ. Nearby was a man
who had been kept hidden from the heathens by God. He heard all this and
recounted it later, just as we have narrated it here.</p>
<p>So the pirates returned to their fleet and concealed Saint Edmund’s
head among thick brambles so that it might not be buried. Some time
after they had left, the remaining people of the country came to the
place where the king’s headless corpse lay. The witness who had observed
everything told them that the pirates had taken the head with them. He
thought (as turned out to be the case) that they had hidden the head
somewhere in the woods.</p>
<p>They all went in a body to the woods and searched everywhere among
the bushes and brambles in their hunt for the head. By a great miracle,
a wolf was sent by God’s guidance to protect the head against other
creatures by day and by night. They proceeded on their search,
constantly calling out to one another as is the custom among those who
frequent the woods:</p>
<p>“Where are you now, friend?”</p>
<p>And the head answered them:</p>
<p>“Here, here, here.”</p>
<p>And it went on answering as often as one of them shouted until they
all came upon the head because of their calling out. There lay the grey
wolf which guarded the head. He held it between his paws and, though
ravenous and hungry, dared not eat the head for God’s sake, but
protected it against animals. They were amazed by the wolf’s
guardianship and carried the head home with them, thanking almighty God
for all his miracles. The wolf, too, followed the head until they came
to the town as though it was tame, and then turned back in the direction
of the woods.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the people placed the head beside the holy body and
buried it hastily as best they might. They raised a church above the
body. Later, after a period of many years, when the raiding had ceased
and peace was granted to the afflicted people, they joined together to
build a church worthy of the saint, for frequent miracles had occurred
at his tomb in the chapel where he had been buried. They intended to
accompany the holy body with public honour and lay it in the church. To
general amazement he was in as good condition as if he were alive. His
body was unblemished and his neck was healed where it had been severed.
Around it was something like a red silken thread as a sign to mankind of
how he had been killed. Similarly, the wounds inflicted by the missiles
of the heathens had been healed by the God of heaven. He lies
uncorrupted to the present day, awaiting the resurrection and eternal
glory….</p>
