<h4 id="a-temple-in-iceland">16. A Temple in Iceland</h4>
<p>Like several other sagas, The Saga of the People of Eyri (Eyrbyggja
saga) begins with the unification of Norway under Harald Finehair and
ends in the eleventh century with the death of Snorri Godi (the priest,
chieftain) in 1031. In this passage, an early settler, Thorolf
Mostrarskegg (Bearded Man from Most, Most-Beard), builds a temple.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Eyrbyggja saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit IV (Reykjavík, 1935),
pp. 7–10.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Thorolf Mostrarskegg offered a great sacrifice and asked his dear
friend Thor whether he should make his peace with the king, or leave the
country and find himself a new future. In answer to his question, Thor
directed Thorolf to Iceland, so he bought a large ocean-going ship and
got it ready for the journey. He took his household and household
property with him, and many of his friends decided to accompany him to
Iceland. He dismantled the temple and took with him most of the wood
from the building, as well as earth from beneath the pedestal where Thor
had sat.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then Thorolf put to sea. He had a favorable wind and when he reached
Iceland, he steered along the south coast and then west around
Reykjaness. After that the wind dropped and they saw that there were
large fjords cutting into the land. Thorolf threw overboard the
high-seat pillars which had stood in the temple; Thor was carved on one
of them. Thorolf declared that wherever Thor brought the pillars ashore,
that’s where he would settle in Iceland. As soon as he threw the pillars
overboard, they drifted toward the western fjord, seeming to travel more
quickly than might be expected. Then a sea breeze arose and they sailed
around Snaefellsness and into the fjord which, they saw, was very broad
and long and surrounded by high mountains. Thorolf called the fjord
Breidafjord [Broadfjord]. Half way along the south side of the fjord, he
made for land and moored his ship in a bay which was afterwards called
Hofsvag [Temple Bay]. They explored the land and discovered that Thor
and the pillars had come ashore at the point of a headland to the north
of the bay. Afterwards, the headland was called Thorsness.</p>
<p>Next, Thorolf carried fire around the boundaries of his land claim,
from Stafa [Staf River] in the west, inland to the river called Thorsa
[Thor’s River] in the east. He settled his crew there, but he himself
built a large house near Hofsvag and called it Hofstad [Templestead].
There he had a temple built. It was a large structure with a door on one
of the side walls close to the end of the building. Inside, in front of
the door, stood the high-seat pillars, studded with nails called god’s
nails. Beyond the pillars the whole interior was a sanctuary and at the
inner end there was an area resembling what we call a choir in churches
nowadays. In the middle of the floor stood an altar-like structure, and
on it lay a ring weighing twenty ounces, which had been formed without a
joint. All oaths were sworn on it, and the temple priest had to wear it
on his arm at every public meeting. A bowl for sacrificial blood always
stood on the altar, and in the bowl lay a twig [or aspergillum] for
sprinkling hlaut, which is the blood of living creatures sacrificed to
the gods. The gods were arranged around the altar in the innermost, or
choir-like, part of the temple.</p>
<p>All men had to pay a tax to the temple and were obliged to support
the temple godi [priest] in all his undertakings, just as nowadays
Thingmen [a man who owed support to a chief, especially at assemblies]
have obligations to their chiefs. The godi was responsible for the
upkeep and maintenance of the temple, and for holding sacrificial feasts
there.</p>
<p>Thorolf named the headland between Vigrafjord and Hofsvag, Thorsness.
On this headland stands a mountain for which Thorolf had such reverence
that no one was permitted to look at it without washing first. Also
nothing was to be killed there, neither man nor beast, unless it came
down from the mountain of its own accord. He called the mountain
Helgafell [Holy Mountain] and believed that he and all his relatives
from Thorsness would go there when they died.</p>
<p>Thorolf designated Thor’s landing place at the point of the headland
as the site for the settlement of lawsuits. He established the local
thing [assembly, judicial and deliberative] there too. The area was so
holy that he did not want it polluted in any way, either by bloodshed or
by human waste; a skerry called Shit Skerry was set aside for the
waste.</p>
<p>Thorolf became a wealthy farmer and maintained a large household
because in those days the islands and the sea were an abundant source of
food.</p>
