<h4 id="on-the-arrival-of-the-varangians-aaaaaaaa">62. On the Arrival of
the Varangians AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>One of the most important sources relating to the Scandinavians in
the East is the so-called Russian Primary Chronicle, in modern critical
literature commonly termed the Tale of Bygone Years, after the opening
sentence of the text. It covers the period from about 850 to the early
twelfth century, but it was compiled only after the mid-eleventh
century, and the value of its information before about 1050 is debated.
It draws on earlier documents, interweaving historical and legendary
material, and its account of the “Calling of the Varangians” is hotly
contested. Indeed, the extent to which the Scandinavians had an impact
on processes of state-formation in what is today Russia has been
vigorously debated by scholars for decades.</p>
<p>Source: ed. and trans. S.H. Cross and O.P. Sherbowitz-Wetzor, The
Russian Primary Chronicle. Laurentian Text (Cambridge, MA: Medieval
Academy of America, 1953), pp. 59–60, 64–69, 71–72.</p>
<p>(859)…The Varangians from beyond the sea imposed tribute upon the
Chuds, the Slavs, the Merians, the Ves, and the Krivichians. But the
Khazars imposed it upon the Polyanians, the Severians, and the
Vyatichians, and collected a squirrel-skin from each hearth.</p>
<p>(860–862)…The tributaries of the Varangians drove them back beyond
the sea and, refusing them further tribute, set out to govern
themselves. There was no law among them, but tribe rose against tribe.
Discord thus ensued among them, and they began to war one against
another. They said to themselves: “Let us seek a prince who may rule
over us, and judge us according to the Law.” They accordingly went
overseas to the Varangian Russes: these particular Varangians were known
as Russes, just as some are called Swedes, and others Normans, English,
and Gotlanders, for they were thus named. The Chuds, the Slavs, the
Krivichians and the Ves then said to the people of Rus [Rus’]: “Our land
is great and rich, but there is no order in it. Come to rule and reign
over us.” They thus selected three brothers with their kinfolk, who took
with them all the Russes and migrated. The oldest, Rurik, located
himself in Novgorod; the second, Sineus, in Beloozero; and the third
Truvor, in Izborsk. On account of these Varangians, the district of
Novgorod became known as the land of Rus. The present inhabitants of
Novgorod are descended from the Varangian race, but aforetime they were
Slavs.</p>
<p>After two years, Sineus and his brother Truvor died, and Rurik
assumed the sole authority. He assigned cities to his followers, Polotzk
to one, Rostov to another, and to another Beloozero. In these cities
there are thus Varangian colonists, but the first settlers were, in
Novgorod, Slavs; in Polotzk, Krivichians; at Beloozero, Ves; in Rostov,
Merians; and in Murom, Muromians. Rurik had dominion over all these
districts.</p>
<p>With Rurik there were two men who did not belong to his kin, but were
boyars [nobles]. They obtained permission to go to Tsar’grad
[Constantinople] with their families. They thus sailed down the Dnieper,
and in the course of their journey they saw a small city on a hill. Upon
their inquiry as to whose town it was, they were informed that three
brothers, Kiy, Shchek, and Khoriv, had once built the city, but that
since their deaths, their descendants were living there as tributaries
of the Khazars. Askold and Dir remained in this city, and after
gathering together many Varangians, they established their dominion over
the country of Polyanians at the same time that Rurik was ruling at
Novgorod.</p>
<p>(863–866)…Askold and Dir attacked the Greeks during the fourteenth
year of the reign of the Emperor Michael. When the emperor had set forth
against the infidels [Muslims] and had arrived at the Black River, the
eparch [governor] sent him word that the Russes were approaching
Tsar’grad, and the emperor turned back. Upon arriving inside the strait,
the Russes made a great massacre of the Christians, and attacked
Tsar’grad in two hundred boats. The emperor succeeded with difficulty in
entering the city. He straightaway hastened with the patriarch Photus to
the Church of Our Lady of the Blachernae, where they prayed all night.
They also sang hymns and carried the sacred vestment of the Virgin to
dip it in the sea. The weather was still, and the sea was calm, but a
storm of wind came up, and when great waves straightaway rose, confusing
the boats of the godless Russes, it threw them upon the shore and broke
them up, so that few escaped such destruction. The survivors then
returned to their native land.</p>
<p>Prince Oleg’s Campaign against Constantinople</p>
<p>(904–907)…Leaving Igor [Igor’] in Kiev, Oleg attacked the Greeks. He
took with him a multitude of Varangians, Slavs, Chuds, Krivichians,
Merians, Polyanians, Severians, Derevlians, Radimichians, Croats,
Dulebians, and Tivercians who are pagan. All these tribes are known as
Great Scythia by the Greeks. With this entire force, Oleg sallied forth
by horse and by ship, and the number of his vessels was two thousand. He
arrived before Tsar’grad, but the Greeks fortified the strait and closed
up the city. Oleg disembarked upon the shore, and ordered his soldiery
to beach the ships. They waged war around the city, and accomplished
much slaughter of the Greeks. They also destroyed many palaces and
burned the churches. Of the prisoners they captured, some they beheaded,
some they tortured, some they shot, and still others they cast into the
sea. The Russes inflicted many other woes upon the Greeks after the
usual manner of soldiers. Oleg commanded his warriors to make wheels
which they attached to the ships, and when the wind was favorable, they
spread the sails and bore down upon the city from the open country. When
the Greeks beheld this, they were afraid, and sending messengers to
Oleg, they implored him not to destroy the city, and offered to submit
to such tribute as he should desire. Thus Oleg halted his troops. The
Greeks then brought out to him food and wine, but he would not accept
it, for it was mixed with poison. Then the Greeks were terrified and
exclaimed: “This is not Oleg, but St. Demetrius, whom God has sent upon
us.” So Oleg demanded that they pay tribute for his two thousand ships
at the rate of twelve grivnas [unit of Kievan currency] per man, with
forty men reckoned to a ship.</p>
<p>The Greeks assented to these terms, and prayed for peace lest Oleg
should conquer the land of Greece. Retiring thus a short distance from
the city, Oleg concluded a peace with the Greek emperors Leo and
Alexander, and sent into the city to them Karl, Farulf, Vermund,
Hrollaf, and Steinvith, with instructions to receive the tribute. The
Greeks promised to satisfy their requirements. Oleg demanded that they
should give to the troops on the two thousand ships twelve grivnas per
bench, and pay in addition the sums required for the various Russian
cities: first Kiev, then Chernigov, Pereiaslavl, Polotzk, Rostov,
Liubech, and other towns. In these cities lived princes subject to
Oleg.</p>
<p>[The Russes proposed the following terms:] “The Russes who come
hither shall receive as much grain as they require. Whosoever come as
merchants shall receive supplies for six months, including bread, wine,
meat, fish and fruit. Baths shall be prepared for them in any volume
they require. When the Russians return homeward, they shall receive from
your emperor food, anchors, cordage, and sails and whatever else is
needed for the journey.”</p>
<p>The Greeks accepted these stipulations, and the emperors and all the
courtiers declared: “If Russes come hither without merchandise, they
shall receive no provisions. Your prince shall personally lay injunction
upon such Russians as journey hither that they shall do no violence in
the towns and throughout our territory. Such Russes as arrive here shall
dwell in the St. Mamas quarter. Our government will send officers to
record their names, and they shall then receive their monthly allowance,
first the natives of Kiev, then those from Chernigov, Pereyaslavl, and
the other cities. They shall not enter the city save through one gate,
unarmed and fifty at a time, escorted by agents of the emperor. They may
conduct business according to their requirements, and without payment of
taxes.”</p>
<p>Thus the emperors Leo and Alexander made peace with Oleg, and after
agreeing upon the tribute and mutually binding themselves by oath, they
kissed the cross, and invited Oleg and his men to swear an oath
likewise. According to the religion of the Russes, the latter swore by
their weapons and by their god Perun, as well as by Volos, the god of
cattle, and thus confirmed the treaty.</p>
<p>Oleg gave orders that sails of brocade should be made for the
Russians and silken ones for the Slavs, and his demand was satisfied.
The Russes hung their shields upon the gates as a sign of victory, and
Oleg then departed from Tsar’grad. The Russes unfurled their sails of
brocade and the Slavs their sails of silk, but the wind tore them. Then
the Slavs said: “Let us keep our canvas ones; silken sails are not made
for the Slavs.” So Oleg came to Kiev, bearing palls, gold, fruit, and
wine, along with every sort of adornment. The people called Oleg “the
Sage,” for they were but pagans, and therefore ignorant.</p>
<p>A Treaty with Byzantium, 911–912</p>
<p>(912)…Oleg despatched his vassals to make peace and to draw up a
treaty between the Greeks and the Russes. His envoys thus made
declaration:</p>
<p>“This is the copy of the treaty concluded under the emperors Leo and
Alexander. We of the Rus nation: Karl, Ingjald, Farulf, Vermund,
Hrollaf, Gunnar, Harold, Karni, Frithleif, Hroarr, Angantyr, Throand,
Leithulf, Fast, and Steinvith, are sent by Oleg, Great Prince of Rus,
and by all the serene and great princes and the great boyars [nobles]
under his sway, unto you, Leo and Alexander and Constantine, great
autocrats in God, emperors of the Greeks, for the maintenance and
proclamation of the long-standing amity which joins Greeks and Russes,
in accordance with the desires of our great princes and at their
command, and on behalf of all those Russes who are subject to the hand
of our prince.</p>
<p>“Our serenity, above all desirous, through God’s help, of maintaining
and proclaiming such amicable relations as now exist between Christians
and Russians, has often deemed it proper to publish and confirm this
amity not merely in words but also in writing and under a firm oath
sworn upon our weapons according to our religion and our law. As we
previously agreed in the name of God’s peace and amity, the articles of
this convention are as follows:</p>
<p>“First, that we shall conclude a peace with your Greeks, and love
each other with all our heart and will, and as far as lies in our power,
prevent any subject of our serene princes from committing any crime or
misdemeanor. Rather shall we exert ourselves as far as possible to
maintain as irrevocable and immutable henceforth and forever the amity
thus proclaimed by our agreement with you Greeks and ratified by
signature and oath. May you Greeks on your part maintain as irrevocable
and immutable henceforth and forever this same amity toward our serene
prince of Rus and toward all the subjects of our serene Prince.</p>
<p>“In the matter of stipulations concerning damage, we subscribe to the
following provisions:</p>
<p>“If clear proofs of tort exist, there shall be a true declaration of
such proofs. But if this declaration is contested, the dissenting party
shall take oath to this effect, and after he shall have taken oath
according to his faith, a penalty shall be assessed in proportion to the
apparent trespass committed.</p>
<p>“Whatsoever Russ kills a Christian, or whatsoever Christian kills a
Russ, shall die, since he has committed murder. If any man flee after
committing a murder, in the case that he is well-to-do, the nearest
relatives of the victim shall receive a legal portion of the culprit’s
property, while the wife of the murderer shall receive a like amount,
which is legally due her. But if the defendant is poor and has escaped,
he may be under duress until he returns, when he shall be executed.</p>
<p>“If any man strike another with a sword or assault him with any other
sort of weapon, he shall, according to Russian law, pay five pounds of
silver for such blow or assault. If the defendant is poor, he shall pay
as much as he is able, and be deprived even of the very clothes he
wears, and he shall also declare upon oath that he has no one to aid
him. Thereafter the case against him shall be discontinued.</p>
<p>“If any Russ commit a theft against a Christian, or vice versa, and
should the transgressor be caught in the act by the victim of the loss,
and be killed while resisting arrest, no penalty shall be exacted for
his death by either Greeks or Russes. The victim of the loss shall
recover the stolen property. If the thief surrenders, he shall be taken
and bound by the one upon whom the theft was committed, and the culprit
shall return whatever he has dared to appropriate, making at the same
time restitution for it.</p>
<p>“If any person, whether Greek or Russ, employs abusive treatment or
violence against another and appropriates by force some articles of his
property, he shall repay three times its value.</p>
<p>“If a ship is detained by high winds upon a foreign shore, and one of
us Russes is near by, the ship with its cargo shall be revictualed and
sent on to Christian territory. We will pilot it through every dangerous
passage until it arrives at a place of safety. But if any such ship thus
detained by storm or by some territorial obstacle cannot possibly reach
its destination, we Russes will extend aid to the crew of this ship, and
conduct them with their merchandise in all security, in case such an
event takes place near Greek territory. But if such an accident befalls
near the Russian shore, the ship’s cargo shall be disposed of, and we
Russes will remove whatever can be disposed of for the account of the
owners. Then, when we proceed to Greece with merchandise or upon an
embassy to your emperor, we shall render up honorably the price of the
sold cargo of the ship. But if anyone on that ship is killed or
maltreated by us Russes, or if any object is stolen, then those who have
committed such acts shall be subject to the previously provided
penalty.</p>
<p>“From this time forth, if a prisoner of either nation is in durance
either of the Russes or of the Greeks, and then sold into another
country, any Russ or Greek who happens to be in that locality shall
purchase the prisoner and return the person thus purchased to his own
native country. The purchaser shall be indemnified for the amount thus
expended, or else the value of the prisoner’s daily labor shall be
reckoned toward the purchase money. If any Russ be taken prisoner by the
Greeks, he shall likewise be sent back to his native land, and his
purchase price shall be repaid, as has been stipulated, according to his
value.</p>
<p>“Whenever you find it necessary to declare war, or when you are
conducting a campaign, providing any Russes desirous of honoring your
emperor shall come at any time and wish to remain in his service, they
shall be permitted in this respect to act according to their desire.</p>
<p>“If a Russian prisoner from any region is sold among the Russes, he
shall be ransomed for twenty bezants and returned to his native
land.</p>
<p>“In case a Russian slave is stolen or escapes or is sold under
compulsion, and if a Russ institutes a claim to this effect which is
substantiated, the slave shall be returned to Rus. If a merchant loses a
slave and institutes a complaint, he shall search for his slave until he
is found, but if any person refuses to allow him to make this search,
the local officer shall forfeit his right of perquisition.</p>
<p>“With respect to the Russes professionally engaged in Greece under
the orders of the Christian emperor, if any of them dies without setting
his property in good order and has no kinsfolk there, his estate shall
be returned to his distant relatives in Rus. But if he makes some
disposition of his goods, the person whom he has designated in writing
as his heir shall receive the property of which he thus disposed. Such
shall be the due process of inheritance in the case of Russes engaging
in trade, of casual travelers in Greece, and of those having debts
outstanding there.</p>
<p>“If a criminal takes refuge in Greece, the Russes shall make
complaint to the Christian Empire, and such criminal shall be arrested
and returned to Rus regardless of his protests. The Russes shall perform
the same service for the Greeks whenever the occasion arises.</p>
<p>“As a convention and an inviolable pledge binding equally upon you
Greeks and upon us Russes, we have caused the present treaty to be
transcribed in vermillion script upon parchment in duplicate. In the
name of the Holy Cross and the Holy and Indivisible Trinity of your one
true God, your emperor has confirmed it with his signature and handed it
to our envoys. According to our own faith and the custom of our nation,
we have sworn to your emperor, who rules over you by the grace of God,
that we will neither violate ourselves, nor allow any of our subjects to
violate the peace and amity assured by the articles thus concluded
between us. We have transmitted this document for the ratification of
your Majesty in order to confirm and promulgate the treaty thus
concluded between us this second of September, in the year of Creation
6420 [911 CE], fifteenth of the indiction.”</p>
<p>A Russian Attack on Byzantium Is Beaten Back by Greek Fire, 941</p>
<p>(935–941)…Igor attacked the Greeks, and the Bulgarians sent word to
the emperor that the Russes were advancing upon Tsar’grad with ten
thousand vessels. The Russes set out across the sea, and began to ravage
Bithynia. They waged war across the Pontus as far as Heraclea and
Paphlagonia, and laid waste the entire region of Nicomedia, burning
everything along the gulf. Of the people they captured, some they
butchered, others they set up as targets and shot at, some they seized
upon, and after binding their hands behind their backs, they drove iron
nails through their heads. Many sacred churches they gave to the flames,
while they burned many monasteries and villages, and took no little
booty on both sides of the sea. Then, when the army came out of the
east, Pantherius the Domestic with forty thousand men, Phocas the
Patrician with the Macedonians, and Theodore the General with the
Thracians, supported by other illustrious nobles, surrounded the Russes.
After taking counsel, the latter threw themselves upon the Greeks, and
as the conflict between them was desperate, the Greeks experienced
difficulty in winning the upper hand. The Russes returned at evening to
their companions, embarked at night upon their vessels, and fled away.
Theophanes pursued them in boats with Greek fire, and dropped it through
pipes upon the Russian ships, so that a strange miracle was offered to
view.</p>
<p>Upon seeing the flames, the Russians cast themselves into the
sea-water, being anxious to escape, but the survivors returned home.
When they came once more to their native land, where each one reported
to his kinsfolk the course of events and described the fire launched
from the ships, they related that the Greeks had in their possession the
lightning from heaven, and had set them on fire by pouring it forth, so
that the Russes could not conquer them. Upon his return, Igor began to
collect a great army, and sent many messengers after the Varangians
beyond the sea, inviting them to attack the Greeks, for he desired to
make war upon them.</p>
