<h4 id="d-saint-olafs-sword-hneitir-aaaaaaaa">(d) Saint Olaf’s Sword,
Hneitir AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>This passage recounts the sword’s history after the death of Saint
Olaf at Stiklestad. From The Saga of Hakon the Broadshouldered.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Hákonar saga
Heiðibreiðs, in Heimskringla, ed., Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 3, pp. 369–71.</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>It has already been recounted that King Olaf threw away the sword
Hneitir when he was wounded at the battle of Stiklestad. A certain
Swede, who had broken his own sword, picked up Hneitir and fought with
it. This man survived the battle and escaped with other fugitives. When
he got back to Sweden, he returned to his farm. He owned the sword all
his life as did his son after him, and so on from one kinsman to
another. Always, when the sword passed from one owner to the next, the
earlier owner told his successor the name of the sword and also where it
had come from.</li>
</ol>
<p>Much later, in the days of Kirjalax [Kurios Alexios, the emperor
Alexius I], the emperor of Mikligard [Constantinople], there were large
companies of Varangians in the city. One summer, the emperor was on a
campaign and his soldiers were living in tents, with the Varangians, the
emperor’s guard, stationed in the open ground outside the camp keeping
watch. They changed guard during the night and the men who had been on
duty previously lay down and slept, all of them fully armed. It was
customary for each man, when he lay down to sleep, to have his helmet on
his head, his shield over him, and his sword under his head, with his
right hand on the hilt.</p>
<p>One of these fellow-soldiers, whose lot it had been to stand guard in
the latter part of the night, woke at dawn to discover that his sword
was missing. When he looked for it, he saw the sword lying on the ground
at a great distance from him, so he got up and fetched it. He thought
that his comrades who had been on watch must have filched the sword as a
practical joke, but they denied it. The same thing happened for three
nights in a row. He himself was greatly puzzled, as were the others who
saw or heard what was going on. He was asked what these events
signified, and he replied that the sword, which was called Hneitir, had
been owned by St. Olaf, who had carried it himself at the battle of
Stiklestad. He also recounted how the sword had changed hands since
then. When, later, the emperor, Kirjalax, heard about it, he summoned
the sword’s owner and gave him three times its value in gold. The
emperor had the sword carried to St. Olaf’s church, which the Varangians
supported. There, it was placed above the altar.</p>
<p>Eindrid the Young was in Mikligard when these events took place and
he told the story when he returned to Norway, as Einar Skulason affirms
in the drapa [heroic praise-poem] he composed for Saint Olaf, where this
event is related.</p>
