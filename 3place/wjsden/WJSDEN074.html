<h4 id="the-annals-of-st-vast-882886-aaaaaaaa">48. The Annals of
St-Vast, 882–886 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Annals of St-Vast, written at that monastery near Corbie, are an
important window into the events of the late ninth century. The entries
for this period are particularly concerned with the activities of the
Northmen and recount the siege of Paris by the Vikings in 885–86; they
may be compared with Abbo’s poem on this event (see doc. 49).</p>
<p>Source: trans. P.E. Dutton, Carolingian Civilization: A Reader, 2nd
ed. (Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press, 2004), pp. 507–12.</p>
<ol start="882" type="1">
<li>The [eastern] Franks raised an army against the Northmen, but at
once turned and ran, and there Walo, the bishop of Metz, died. The Danes
set that most famous palace of Aachen on fire [and also] some
monasteries. They also set cities on fire—the most noble city of Trier
and Cologne—also the palace of kings and villas, with the inhabitants of
the place having been killed. The emperor Charles [the Fat] raised a
huge army against them and besieged them at Elslo [in the Netherlands].
King Godefrid came over to [Charles] and the emperor gave him the
kingdom of the Frisians which Rorik the Dane once held. He gave Gisela,
the daughter of King Lothar [II by Waldrada] to him in marriage and he
made the Northmen depart from his kingdom.</li>
</ol>
<p>King Louis [III, of west Francia] sought out the Northmen on the
Loire and hoped to eject them from his kingdom and to receive Hasting as
his friend, which he did….</p>
<p>In the month of October the Northmen established themselves at Condé
and bitterly ruined the kingdom of Carloman. King Carloman and his army
resided on the Somme at Barleux, but the Northmen did not stop their
robbery and all the inhabitants of that place who remained fled to the
other side of the Somme. Whence with their forces making a trip through
La Thiéarche they crossed over the Oise. King Carloman pursued them and
he caught up with them at Avaux. A battle broke out and the Franks were
superior; almost a thousand Northmen died there. But this battle in no
way tamed them. Carloman went to the palace of Compiègne, while the
Northmen took to their boats and returned to Condé. From there they
devastated with fire and sword the entire kingdom up to the Oise.
Defenses were pulled down, monasteries and churches were demolished, and
the servants of the [Christian] religion were killed by the sword or by
hunger or they were sold abroad, and the inhabitants of the countryside
were killed. No one resisted them.</p>
<p>Abbot Hugh [of St-Martin of Tours], hearing of these things, raised
an army and came to the king. The Northmen were returning from the
region of Beauvais where they had been plundering. Hugh and the king
chased them into the woods of Vicogne [near Condé], but the Northmen
scattered here and there and, few of them having been killed, they
returned to their ships….</p>
<ol start="883" type="1">
<li><p>Fulk, an admirable man in all things, succeeded Hincmar in the
episcopal see [of Rheims]. After this the Northmen set the monastery and
church of Saint Quentin afire. At the same time they set fire to the
church of the Mother of God in the city of Arras. Again Carloman pursued
the Northmen, but he did nothing either successful or useful [against
them]. At this time Rotgarius, the bishop of Beauvais, died and was
succeeded by Honoratus. In the springtime the Northmen departed from
Condé and sought out lands along the sea. Returning there through the
summer, they forced the Flemings to flee from their own lands. All
around they furiously laid waste to things with their swords and with
fire. Around autumn, in order to protect the kingdom, King Carloman
established his army in the region of Vithmau at the villa of Miannay
[near Abbeville] opposite to Lavier. At the end of October the Northmen
came to Lavier with cavalry and infantry and supplies. Ships also
entered the Somme by the sea and forced the king and all his army to
flee and made them pass over the Oise. Then the Northmen prepared to
winter at the city of Amiens. Next, with no one resisting them, they
devastated all the land up to the Seine and around the Oise and they
burned both the monasteries and churches of Christ. Then the Franks,
seeing that things grew ever better for the Northmen, sent a certain
Christian Dane by the name of Sigfried, who carefully worked to save the
kingdom, to [the Northmen]. He came to Beauvais and then proceeded to
Amiens to do the business enjoined upon him.</p></li>
<li><p>Then Engelwin, the bishop of Paris, died and Abbot Gauzelin
replaced him. The Northmen did not stop from capturing and killing
Christians or from destroying churches, pulling down fortifications, or
putting villas to fire. The corpses of clerics, laymen, nobles, women,
young people and children were lying in every street. There was no
street or place in which the dead did not lie and lamentation and
sadness filled everyone, seeing that Christians were massacred.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Meanwhile, because the king was still a young man, all the magnates
gathered in Compiègne to determine what they should do. After they had
discussed the matter, they sent Sigfried, the Danish Christian, who was
loyal to the king and the nephew of Rorik, [to the Northmen]. He was
supposed to deal with the chiefs of his people to see if they would
accept tribute and leave the kingdom. He undertook to fulfill the
assignment given to him and went to Amiens. [There] he repeated his
mission to the chiefs of his people who were present. After a lengthy
discussion, delayed in part by much back and forth activity, by
repeating now these things, now those, in the end [the Northmen] imposed
on the king and the Franks a tribute of 12,000 pounds of silver
calculated according to their way of weighing things. Once hostages had
been exchanged, those who lived beyond the Oise began to feel safer.
Thus from the day of the Purification of Saint Mary [2 February] until
the month of October [884] this freedom from attack was granted to
them.</p>
<p>But the Northmen, raiding as usual beyond the Scheldt, devastated
with fire and sword churches, monasteries, cities and villages, and
slaughtered people. After holy Easter [19 April] the [people] began to
pay the tribute. Churches and church properties were ruthlessly stripped
[of wealth]. Finally, when the tribute had been paid, the Franks
gathered together to resist the Northmen in case they intended to break
their agreement. The Northmen burned down their camps and withdrew from
Amiens. The king and the Franks pursued them on a slow march beyond the
Oise. The Danes on their journey came to Boulogne-sur-Mer and there
deliberated what they should do. A group of them crossed the sea,
another group came to Louvain in the kingdom that once belonged to
Lothar and there they set up camps in order to spend the winter. The
Franks who were with Carloman returned to their own land; a few young
men remained with him to hunt in the Bezu forest [where he was killed in
a hunting accident].</p>
<ol start="885" type="1">
<li>The emperor Charles, having received the news [of Lothar’s death],
made a rapid march and came to Ponthion, and there all the men who lived
in Carloman’s kingdom came to him and placed themselves under his rule.
Thus the emperor Charles returned to his own land, ordering those who
lived in the kingdom [that was formerly] Carloman’s to proceed to
Louvain to fight the Northmen. On the agreed upon day both armies came
together at that place, except Abbot Hugh, who held back from this
outing because of a foot ailment. But [these armies] accomplished
nothing successful there, and returned to their own lands in great
shame. The Danes laughed at the Franks who came from Carloman’s kingdom:
“So why did you come to [see] us? It was not necessary. We know how you
are and [what] you want, so let us visit you. Let us do that [for
you].”</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same time [in May] Godefrid the Dane, because he was
undertaking to break his pledge with the crafty help of his vassal,
Gerulf [of Frisia], was killed by Duke Henry…. On the eight Kalends of
July [24 June] [the Northmen] with their entire army entered Rouen and
the Franks pursued them to the same place. Since their ships had still
not come there, they crossed the Seine in ships found along the river
and then they fortified a camp there. While this was taking place, all
those who lived in Neustria and Burgundy assembled and, when an army had
been raised, they approached as if to make war upon the Northmen. But,
though they should have fought, [when] Ragnold, the duke of Le Mans,
fell with a few of his men, they all returned to their own lands in
great sadness, having accomplished nothing useful.</p>
<p>Then the Northmen began to rage with fire and to thirst for
slaughter. They killed and captured Christians, demolished churches, and
no one resisted them. Once again the Franks prepared themselves to
resist, not in war, but rather by constructing fortifications to impede
the progress of their ships. They constructed a castle on the river Oise
at a place [now] called Pontoise, and they entrusted Aletramnus with
guarding it. Bishop Gauzelin built fortifications at Paris. But in the
month of November, the Northmen set out upon the Oise and surrounded
with a blockade the castle at Pontoise. They stopped those who were shut
up in the castle from drawing water from the river, for they had no
other water to draw upon. But those who were in the castle began to be
pressed by their lack of water. Need I say more? They sued for peace,
seeking only to leave there alive. Once hostages were exchanged on both
sides, Aletramnus and his men set out for Beauvais. The Northmen set
fire to the castle and stole everything that was left there, for those
who abandoned the castle left everything there except for their arms and
horses. It was under this condition that they had been allowed to
leave.</p>
<p>Wildly excited by their victory, the Northmen approached Paris and,
with great energy immediately attacked a tower. They thought that they
could take it without any great delay, because it was not yet fully
strengthened. But Christians defended it with great vigor and the battle
lasted from morning till evening. Night interrupted the battle and so
the Northmen, that night, returned to their ships [26 November]. Bishop
Gauzelin and Count Odo labored all through the night with their men to
fortify the tower in preparation for [the coming] battle. The following
day [27 November] the Northmen again rushed back to the battle at the
same tower and a fierce battle went on until sunset. But the Danes,
having lost many men, returned to their ships. Then they set up a camp
for themselves opposite the city and they laid siege to the city,
constructed machines [of war], employed fire, and used all their
ingenuity to capture the city. But the Christians fighting bravely
against them were superior in everything.</p>
<ol start="886" type="1">
<li>On the eighth Ides of February [6 February] a grave crisis arose for
the inhabitants of the city, since a very serious rise in the water
level of the river smashed the smaller bridge [running to the south from
the Ile de la Cité]. When the bishop learned of this event, he selected
some strong and noble men to guard the tower that night so that, in the
morning, they might restore the bridge. None of this was hidden to the
Northmen. They rose before dawn with all their men and rushed to that
tower and laid siege to it and they began to attack before help from the
city could arrive. Those men in the tower resisted bravely and the
shouting of the multitude [of them] lifted up to heaven. The bishop
stood on the wall of the city with everyone who was in the city crying
intensely because they could not come to the assistance of their people
and because there was nothing they could do [to help]. [Gauzelin]
entrusted them to Christ’s care. The Northmen approached the gate of
that tower in [full] force and tried to set fire to it. Those men inside
the tower, worn down by wounds and defeated by fire, and to the dishonor
of Christians, were killed in various ways and their bodies were flung
into the river. Then the Northmen demolished the tower. After these
things [had occurred], they did not cease their attack upon the
city.</li>
</ol>
<p>The bishop’s heart was broken over this grave loss. He sent letters
to Count Herkenger [of Melun], commanding him to go as quickly as he
could to eastern Francia and to search out Henry, the duke of Austrasia,
so that he might come to the assistance of the bishop and the Christian
people [as a whole]. What was commanded, Herkenger at once carried out
and he convinced Henry with his army to come to Paris, but Henry
accomplished nothing there and returned to his own territory. But
Gauzelin, who was anxious to help his Christian people in every way,
reached a cordial understanding with Sigfried, the king of the Danes, to
free [Paris] from the siege.</p>
<p>While these things were taking place, the bishop fell gravely ill,
died [on 16 April] and was buried in the city. His death was not a
secret to the Northmen who, before the fact was known to the citizens
[of Paris], shouted from outside the city that he was dead. The people,
touched by the death of their bishop and by the siege, were immensely
depressed, but the illustrious Count Odo fortified them with his
encouraging words. Nevertheless the Northmen daily attacked the city and
many people on both sides were killed, many were laid low with wounds,
and food began to grow scarce in the city.</p>
<p>Then [on 12 May] Hugh, the venerable abbot, died and was buried in
the monastery of Saint German of Auxerre. But Odo, seeing the people
fall into despair, went out of the city secretly to seek help from the
chief man of the kingdom and to send word to the emperor that Paris
would soon perish if it did not receive assistance. Returning to Paris
after his absence, Odo discovered a great deal of sadness, but he did
not enter the city without an astonishing incident, for the Northmen,
knowing in advance of his return, blocked off the gate of the tower to
him. But even with his horse dead, Odo slashed at his enemies left and
right and, entering the city, made his sad people happy. No one can
count the dead, what dangers they faced there, how many thousands of
people on both sides fell there in various skirmishes. For, without any
cessation, those [warriors] struck that city with a varying complement
of arms, machines [of war], and battering rams. But with great
persistence they begged God [for help] and were delivered. But in the
eight or so months before the emperor could come to [Paris], the
struggle continued in various ways.</p>
