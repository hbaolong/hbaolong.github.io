<h4 id="the-jomsvikings-meet-their-end">84. The Jomsvikings Meet their
End</h4>
<p>Supposedly an elite group of Viking mercenaries of the ninth and
tenth centuries, the Jomsvikings are described as the greatest of
warriors, whose exploits are detailed in the saga bearing their name as
well as in other texts. Whether the Jomsvikings were historical or not,
in the sagas they represent the embodiment of the heroic ideal. The
following passage from Olaf Tryggvason’s Saga in Heimskringla shows how
they face death at the battle of Hjorundarfjord in 986.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Óláfs saga
Tryggvasonar, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 1, pp. 273–86.</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>King Svein [Svein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, ca 960–1014] held a
magnificent banquet to which he summoned all the important men in his
kingdom so that he could honor his father, Harald, with a funeral feast.
Shortly before this, in Skane, Strut Harald had also died as had Veseti
in Bornholm: he was father of Bui Digri and his brothers. King Svein
sent word to the Jomsvikings that Earl Sigvald and Bui, with their
brothers, should come to honor their own fathers at the feast provided
by the king. The Jomsvikings came to the feast with all their bravest
men. They had forty ships from Vendland and twenty from Skane. A huge
crowd of men assembled there.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the first day of the feast, before he mounted his father’s high
seat, King Svein drank a memorial toast and took an oath that before
three years were over he would invade England with his army and kill
King Athelred [Athelred the Unready, ca 968–1016] or expel him from the
land. Everyone at the funeral feast had to drink that memorial toast.
Then the chiefs of the Jomsvikings were served the strongest drink in
the biggest drinking horn available. When they had drunk that toast,
then everyone had to drink a toast to Christ and again the Jomsvikings
were served the fullest horn and the strongest drink. The third toast
was to St. Michael and everyone drank it.</p>
<p>After that, Earl Sigvald drank a memorial toast to his father and
swore an oath that before three years were out he would invade Norway
and kill Earl Hakon [r. 970–995] or drive him from the country. Then his
brother, Thorkel the Tall, swore an oath that he would follow Sigvald to
Norway and would not flee the battle as long as his brother was
fighting. Next, Bui Digri swore that he would go to Norway with them and
would not flee from the battle against Earl Hakon. His brother Sigurd
then swore that he would go to Norway and would not run away as long as
the majority of the Jomsvikings were fighting. Then Vagn Akason swore an
oath that he would go to Norway and that he would not come back until he
had killed Thorkel Leire and gone to bed with his daughter, Ingibjorg.
Many other chiefs made vows about various other matters. That day, the
men drank all through the funeral feast, but, the morning after, when
the Jomsvikings were sober, they thought that they had said too much and
held a conference to decide how they should proceed. They decided to get
their equipment together as quickly as possible and make ready their
ships and their army. News of this spread far and wide throughout the
land.</p>
<ol start="36" type="1">
<li>Hakon’s son, Earl Eirik, heard the news when he was in Raumarik.
Immediately, he gathered his troops together and then went to Uppland.
From there, he continued northwards across the mountains to Trondheim to
meet his father, Earl Hakon. Thord Kolbeinsson tells of this in
Eiriksdrápa [Eirik’s Praise-poem]:</li>
</ol>
<p>From the south there traveled afar</p>
<p>fierce rumors of war</p>
<p>and of armored men. Farm-folk</p>
<p>feared disaster.</p>
<p>The sea-warrior [Hakon] heard</p>
<p>of long-planked ships in the south,</p>
<p>dragged down from the beaches,</p>
<p>Danish ships sent to sea.</p>
<ol start="37" type="1">
<li>Earl Hakon and Earl Eirik sent a war arrow through the whole
Trondelag and dispatched messages to both the Møre provinces and
Raumsdal, as well as north to Naumadal and Halogaland. They called for a
full levy of both men and ships, as is told in Eiriksdrápa:</li>
</ol>
<p>The skald’s praise-poem swells.</p>
<p>The shield-warrior has spread on the sea</p>
<p>his serpent-ships,</p>
<p>his swift vessels under sail;</p>
<p>when the great warrior</p>
<p>went in haste to protect</p>
<p>his father’s land with his shield,</p>
<p>many ships lay off the coast.</p>
<p>Earl Hakon immediately headed south to Møre to scout and gather
troops, while Earl Eirik assembled the army and moved south.</p>
<ol start="38" type="1">
<li>The Jomsvikings made for Limafjord with their fleet and from there
they sailed out to sea with sixty ships. They arrived at Agder and
immediately steered north to Rogaland. As soon as they reached Earl
Hakon’s territory, the Jomsvikings began to pillage. They sailed north
along the coast, plundering as they went.</li>
</ol>
<p>A man called Geirmund, traveling with a few men in a fast boat,
headed north to Møre where he met Earl Hakon. Presenting himself to the
earl, he told Hakon the news that there was an army from Denmark in the
south of the country. The earl asked if he knew this for certain and
Geirmund stretched out one of his arms, which was severed at the wrist.
This, he said, was clear evidence that there was an army in the country.
Then the earl asked detailed questions about the army. Geirmund said
that they were Jomsvikings and that they had killed many people and
pillaged far and wide.</p>
<p>“But they are moving quickly and aggressively,” he said. “I’m afraid
that it won’t be long till they show up here.”</p>
<p>Then, traveling day and night, the earl rowed into every fjord, going
in on one side and coming out by the other. He sent spies to the uplands
around Eid, and south to the Fjords, and also to the north where Eirik
had gone with his army. It is told thus in Eiriksdrápa:</p>
<p>The war-wise earl</p>
<p>had longships at sea,</p>
<p>launched high prows,</p>
<p>threats to Sigvald.</p>
<p>Oars quivered, but the prey</p>
<p>of the predatory raven</p>
<p>feared no death,</p>
<p>divided foam with their oarblades.</p>
<p>Earl Eirik hurried south with his army as fast as he could.</p>
<ol start="39" type="1">
<li>Earl Sigvald steered his fleet north to the Stad area. The first
place he came to was the Herey Islands. Even though the Vikings came
across local people, the locals never told them the truth about what
Hakon and Eirik were up to. The Vikings laid waste wherever they went.
They lay off Hod, went ashore there and raided. They herded both people
and cattle to their ships and killed all the men who were able to bear
arms. As they were returning to their ships, an old farmer approached
them and drew near to Bui’s men. The farmer said: “Driving cows and
calves to the shore isn’t very warlike behavior. You’d do better to trap
the bear, now that you’re almost at its den.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“What’s the fellow saying?” they asked. “Can you tell us anything
about Earl Hakon?”</p>
<p>“He rowed into Hjorundarfjord yesterday. He had only one or two
ships, three at the most, and he hadn’t heard anything about you,” the
farmer replied. At once, Bui and his men rushed to their ships,
abandoning all their plunder. Bui said, “Let’s put this information to
good use; we’re on the brink of victory.”</p>
<p>They reached their ships and rowed out immediately. Earl Sigvald
called to them and asked what was up. They replied that Earl Hakon was
there in the fjord. Sigvald immediately weighed anchor and they rowed
north around the island of Hod.</p>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li>The earls Hakon and Eirik lay in Hallkelsvik where their entire
fleet of 150 ships had assembled. They had got word that the Jomsvikings
had sailed around Hod. So the earls rowed north in search of them. The
two sides met at a place called Hjorungavagr and drew up their fleets
for the battle. Earl Sigvald raised his standard in the middle of his
troops and Earl Hakon marshaled his fleet for the attack. Earl Sigvald
had twenty ships, and Hakon had sixty. In Hakon’s army were the
chieftains Thorir Hjort from Halogaland and Styrkar from Gimsar. On one
wing of Sigvald’s fleet were Bui Digri and Sigurd his brother, with
twenty ships. Opposite them Earl Eirik, Hakon’s son, took up position
with sixty ships, and with him were the chieftains Guthbrand the White
from the Uplands and Thorkell Leira from Vik. On the other wing of
Sigvald’s fleet, Vagn Akason positioned himself to the fore with twenty
ships, and opposing him was Hakon’s son Svein with sixty ships. Among
his troops were Skeggi from Uphaug in Yrjar and Rognvald from Ærvik in
Stad. As it is told in Eiriksdrápa:</li>
</ol>
<p>Slender ships glided</p>
<p>to sea-battle with the Danes;</p>
<p>the fleet sped</p>
<p>along the sea-coast;</p>
<p>at Møre the earl disabled many</p>
<p>ships of the gold-rich Danes;</p>
<p>the ships drifted,</p>
<p>heaped with the warm dead.</p>
<p>Eyvind Skaldaspillir also says this in Haleygjatal:</p>
<p>The meeting was miserable,</p>
<p>the morning grim for the Ynglings’ [Norwegians’]</p>
<p>foes, when the earls urged their fleet</p>
<p>furiously against the destroying</p>
<p>Danes, when sword-bearing Hakon</p>
<p>drove his sea-riding ships</p>
<p>against the Danish fleet.</p>
<p>Then the fleets joined battle and a fierce fight began. Many men fell
on both sides, but far more fell on Hakon’s side because the Jomsvikings
fought with vigor and daring and their weapons went right through the
shields of their opponents. Such a hail of weapons was directed at Earl
Hakon that his mail shirt was cut to pieces and he threw it off. Tind
Hallkelson says of this:</p>
<p>The splendid mail shirt</p>
<p>that the jeweled woman</p>
<p>had readied for the earl</p>
<p>with her own hands</p>
<p>was riven asunder</p>
<p>in the heat of battle.</p>
<p>There the ringed mail shirt</p>
<p>was stripped from the earl;</p>
<p>(the lord of men still</p>
<p>bears the marks of it).</p>
<p>The warrior threw it off, and the ships</p>
<p>of the mail-clad Danes were cleared.</p>
<ol start="41" type="1">
<li>The Jomsvikings’ ships were bigger and had higher sides than
Hakon’s, but both sides fought bravely. Vagn Akason attacked Svein
Hakonson’s ship so violently that Svein backed up and was on the verge
of flight. At that moment, Earl Eirik pressed forward into the battle
line against Vagn, who retreated. Now the ships were in the same
position as they had been at first. Then Eirik returned to his own ranks
where his men had pulled back. Bui had cut the ropes binding his ship to
the others in his formation and was bent on pursuing Eirik’s men as they
fled. Earl Eirik laid his ship broadside to Bui’s and a fierce, closely
fought battle broke out. Two or three of Eirik’s ships came alongside
Bui’s single vessel.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then foul weather set in with a hailstorm so severe that a single
hailstone weighed an ounce. Sigvald cut the ties between his ship and
the others. Then he turned his ship around, intending to flee. Vagn
Akason shouted to him and begged him not to go, but Earl Sigvald paid no
attention to what he said. Then Vagn threw a spear at him, but hit the
steersman. Earl Sigvald rowed off with thirty-five ships, leaving
twenty-five behind. Then Earl Hakon brought his ship to the other side
of Bui’s. Incessant blows fell on Bui’s men. Vigfuss, son of Killer
Glum, lifted up a pointed anvil which lay on the deck and which someone
had just used to rivet the hilt of his sword. Vigfuss was immensely
strong. He hurled the anvil with both hands and drove it into Aslak
Holmskalli’s head so that the point penetrated his brain. Aslak had not
been wounded till this moment, but had struck blows to left and right.
Aslak was Bui’s foster son and was entrusted with the bow position on
Bui’s ship. Another man there was Havard Cutter. He was the strongest
and bravest of men.</p>
<p>During this attack, Eirik’s men boarded Bui’s ship and headed aft to
the raised deck where Bui stood. Then Thorstein Midlang gave Bui a
terrible wound across the forehead, shattering his nose-guard. Bui
struck Thorstein in the side and sliced him in two at the waist. Then
Bui grabbed up two chests filled with gold and shouted loudly:</p>
<p>“Overboard, all Bui’s men!”</p>
<p>Bui plunged overboard with the chests and many of his men leapt after
him. Many men died aboard the ship because there was no point in asking
for mercy. Bui’s ship was cleared of men from stem to stern and
afterwards the other ships were cleared too, one after another.</p>
<p>Next, Earl Eirik came alongside Vagn’s ship. There was fearsome
resistance, but, at length, the ship was cleared and Vagn was taken
prisoner. He and thirty of his men were tied up and taken ashore. Then
Thorkell Leire approached Vagn and said:</p>
<p>“You took an oath to kill me, Vagn, but it looks more likely that
I’ll kill you.”</p>
<p>Vagn and his men sat together on a fallen tree. Thorkell had a great
ax and he beheaded the man sitting at the end of the tree-trunk. Vagn
and his men were bound together by a rope tied around their legs, but
their hands were free. One of them said:</p>
<p>“I have a cloak-pin in my hand. I’ll stick it in the earth if I know
anything when my head is cut off.” When his head was off, the pin fell
from his hand.</p>
<p>Next to him sat a handsome man with a fine head of hair. He swept his
hair forward over his head and stretched out his neck, saying, “Don’t
get my hair all bloody.”</p>
<p>A man grasped his hair and held it fast. As Thorkell swung the ax,
the Viking jerked his head back sharply and the man holding his hair was
left in the way. The ax cut off both his hands and embedded itself in
the ground.</p>
<p>Then Earl Eirik came up and asked: “Who is this good-looking
fellow?”</p>
<p>He replied, “I am called Sigurd and I am Bui’s illegitimate son. Not
all the Jomsvikings are dead yet.”</p>
<p>“For sure, you are a true son of Bui,” said Eirik. “Will you accept a
pardon?”</p>
<p>“That depends on who’s offering it,” replied Sigurd.</p>
<p>Eirik answered, “The man offering it is the man with the power to do
so—Earl Eirik.” “I’ll accept,” said Sigurd, and he was released from the
rope.</p>
<p>Then Thorkell Leire asked: “Earl, even if you mean to give all these
men quarter, Vagn Akason isn’t going to leave here alive.” He rushed
forward with his ax raised, but a Viking called Skathi threw himself
over the rope and fell in front of Thorkell’s feet. Thorkell fell over
him, flat on his face. Vagn seized the ax, raised it, and dealt Thorkell
his death wound. Eirik said, “Vagn, will you accept a pardon?”</p>
<p>“I will,” he replied, “if we all receive one.” “Free them from the
rope,” said the Earl, and it was done. Eighteen men were killed and
twelve were pardoned.</p>
<ol start="42" type="1">
<li>Earl Hakon and many of his men were sitting on a fallen tree when a
bowstring twanged on Bui’s ship. The arrow struck Gizur from Valdres, a
splendidly dressed landowner, who was sitting next to the earl. Some men
boarded the ship and found Havard Cutter standing on his knees by the
ship’s side, for the lower parts of his legs had been cut off. He held a
bow and when the men reached the ship, he asked, “Who fell off the
log?”</li>
</ol>
<p>They answered that it was a man called Gizur. “Then I wasn’t as lucky
as I wished to be,” said Havard. “You’ve done quite enough damage, and
you’ll do no more,” they replied, and killed him.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the dead were searched, and twenty-five of the
Jomsvikings’ ships were stripped. The booty was carried off and divided.
As Tind says:</p>
<p>Sword bit limb</p>
<p>when the warlord laid</p>
<p>the sword’s edge</p>
<p>on the southern host;</p>
<p>there was danger for the army</p>
<p>until the sword-bearing earl</p>
<p>could clear twenty-five</p>
<p>Danish longships.</p>
<p>Then the army was disbanded, and Earl Hakon went to Trondheim. He was
not at all pleased that Eirik had given quarter to Vagn Akason. People
say that in this battle Earl Hakon had sacrificed his son, Erling, for
victory and that, afterwards, the hail storm arose and the tide of
slaughter turned against the Jomsvikings.</p>
<p>Earl Eirik went to Uppland and then traveled east to his own
territory. Vagn Akason went with him. Then Eirik gave Ingibjorg,
daughter of Thorkell Leire, to Vagn in marriage. He also gave Vagn a
fine longship, fully equipped and complete with a crew. They parted the
best of friends. Then Vagn went south, home to Denmark, and afterwards
became a distinguished man; many great men are descended from him.</p>
