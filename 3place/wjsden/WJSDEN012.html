<h4 id="a-prophetess-in-greenland-aaaaaaaa">9. A Prophetess in Greenland
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Gudrid mentioned here is Gudrid Thorbjornsdaughter, who married
Thorfinn Karlsefni and traveled to Vinland. From Eirik the Red’s Saga.
(See docs. 77 and 78.)</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Eiríks saga Rauða, in Eyrbyggja
saga, ed. Einar Ól. Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit IV
(Reykjavík, 1935), pp. 206–8.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>At that time, there was a serious famine in Greenland. Those who
went out hunting found slim pickings and some didn’t come back at all.
In the settlement there lived a woman called Thorbjorg. She could see
into the future and was nicknamed the Little Prophetess. She had had
nine sisters, all with the gift of prophecy, but she was the only one
still alive. In winter it was her custom to attend banquets, and she was
invited mostly by people who were curious about their own destiny or the
outlook for the coming season. Since Thorkel was the leading farmer
there, people thought that it was up to him to find out when the present
lean times would end. Thorkel invited the prophetess to his home and
gave her a fine reception as was customary when this sort of woman was
received. A high seat was prepared for her and on it was a cushion that
had to be stuffed with hen feathers.</li>
</ol>
<p>She arrived in the evening with the man who had been sent to fetch
her and this is how she was dressed: she was wearing a blue cloak that
was fastened with ties, and decorated with stones from top to bottom.
Around her neck, she had glass beads and, on her head, she wore a hood
of black lambskin with an inner lining of white catskin. She carried a
staff in her hand. On it was a knob, decorated with brass and set with
stones. Attached to her belt was a large skin purse where she kept the
charms she needed for her craft. On her feet she wore calfskin shoes
with the hair still on them. They had long, tough laces with large tin
knobs on the ends. Her gloves were catskin with white fur inside. When
she came in, everyone thought it was fitting to address her
respectfully. She received these greetings according to how much she
esteemed the person giving them. Thorkel the Farmer took the wise woman
by the hand and led her to the seat that had been prepared for her. He
asked her to run her eyes over his household, herd, and house. She
hadn’t much to say about anything. The tables were set up in the evening
and this is the food that was prepared for the prophetess. She had
porridge made from kid’s milk and, as a meat dish, she had hearts from
all the various kinds of beasts on the farm. She ate with a brass spoon
and a knife with a walrus-tusk handle, mounted with a double ring of
brass; the knife had a broken point.</p>
<p>When the tables were put away, Thorkel the Farmer went over to
Thorbjorg and asked her whether the house and the manners of the
household were to her liking. He asked how quickly she would know the
answer to his question, adding that everyone wanted to know. She replied
that she would not speak until the following morning, after she had
slept the night there.</p>
<p>Late in the following day, she was supplied with everything she
needed to perform her magic. She asked for women who knew the chants
called vardlokkur [spirit summoners] that she needed for her witchcraft.
However, no such women were to be found. So a search was made throughout
the farm for anyone with this knowledge.</p>
<p>Then Gudrid said, “I’m neither skilled in magic nor a prophetess, but
Halldis, my foster-mother in Iceland, taught me chants that she called
vardlokkur.”</p>
<p>“Then you know more than I thought,” said Thorbjorg. “I have no
intention of taking part in this sort of ceremony,” said Gudrid,
“because I am a Christian woman.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you could help the people here and be no worse a woman for
it,” said Thorbjorg. “Anyway, I will leave it to Thorkel to provide
what’s needed.” Thorkel now pressured Gudrid and she agreed to do as he
wished. Thorbjorg sat on the witch’s dais and the women formed a circle
around it. Then Gudrid sang the songs so well and beautifully that none
of those present thought that they had ever heard finer singing.</p>
<p>The prophetess thanked Gudrid for her songs and said that there were
now many spirits present who had listened to them with pleasure. “Before
this,” she said, “these spirits wanted nothing to do with us and would
not obey us. Now many things are clear to me which before were concealed
both from me and from others. I can tell you that this famine won’t last
much longer and the year will improve with the spring. The sickness that
has lasted so long will clear up faster than expected.</p>
<p>“I’ll reward you right away, Gudrid, for the help you have given us,
for your whole future is now clearly visible to me. You will make a most
honorable match here in Greenland, though the marriage won’t last long,
for your path in life points toward Iceland. There, your lineage will be
long and distinguished and on your descendants a bright light will
shine. Now, daughter, go safely and well.”</p>
