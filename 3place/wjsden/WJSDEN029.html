<h4 id="a-gunnars-posthumous-poem-aaaaaaaa">(a) Gunnar’s Posthumous Poem
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Although he stays in his mound, Gunnar appears to have a ghostly
afterlife. From Njal’s Saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 192–94.</p>
<ol start="78" type="1">
<li>…On one occasion, a strange event occurred at Hlidarend. A shepherd
and a servant-woman were driving livestock near Gunnar’s burial mound;
it seemed to them that Gunnar was in good spirits and reciting verses in
the mound. They went home and told Gunnar’s mother, Rannveig, what had
happened. She asked them to tell Njal. So they went to Bergthorshval and
told him and he made them repeat the story three times. Afterwards, he
and Skarphedin spoke in private for a long time.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then Skarphedin picked up his ax and returned with the servants to
Hlidarend. Hogni and Rannveig were delighted to see him and welcomed him
warmly. Rannveig invited him to pay a long visit and he promised that he
would. He and Hogni were always together, both indoors and out. Hogni
was a fine, bold man. He was also skeptical, so they did not dare tell
him about the apparition.</p>
<p>One evening, Skarphedin and Hogni were outside, to the south of
Gunnar’s mound. The moon shone brightly though, from time to time, it
was hidden by clouds. The burial mound appeared to be open and Gunnar
had turned so that he was looking directly at the moon. They thought
they saw four lights burning in the mound, and these lights cast no
shadows. They saw that Gunnar was happy and cheerful-looking. He recited
a poem so loudly that they could have heard it clearly even if they had
been further away.</p>
<p>The great-hearted gold-giver,</p>
<p>Bold in bloody battles,</p>
<p>Daring in deeds, Hogni’s</p>
<p>Splendid father spoke:</p>
<p>The shade of the shield-warrior</p>
<p>Called yielding cowardly,</p>
<p>Preferred to fall in the fight,</p>
<p>A hero in his helmet,</p>
<p>Preferred to fall in the fight.</p>
<p>Then the burial mound closed up again.</p>
<p>“Would you have believed this if anyone had told you about it?” asked
Skarphedin. “I would have believed it if Njal had told me,” replied
Hogni, “for it is said he never lies.”</p>
<p>“An apparition like this has great significance,” said Skarphedin.
“When Gunnar himself appears and tells us that he would rather die than
give in to his enemies, he is teaching us what we should do.”</p>
<p>“I won’t manage to do anything unless you help me,” said Hogni. “I
won’t forget how Gunnar acted after the death of your kinsman, Sigmund,”
said Skarphedin. “I’ll give you all the help I can. My father promised
Gunnar that he would give you or Rannveig whatever help you needed.”
Then they went back to Hlidarend.</p>
