Rollo Obtains Normandy from the King of the Franks AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The second book of Dudo of St. Quentin’s History of the Normans (doc.
38) concerns the activities of Rollo, the ancestor of the Norman dukes,
who, exiled from Dacia by a tyrannous king, plundered Frisia and fought
with the Franks before receiving lands at the mouth of the Seine River
from the Frankish king Charles the Simple by the treaty of
St. Clair-sur-Epte. Dudo places Rollo’s baptism in 912, but historians
treat the date with skepticism; in fact, no source mentions Rollo before
his defeat at Chartres in 910, and his baptism was forced upon him after
defeat. In Dudo’s History, Rollo becomes a sort of Viking Aeneas who
develops into a paragon of Christian virtue.</p>
<p>Source: trans. E. Christiansen, Dudo of St. Quentin, History of the
Normans (Woodbridge, Suffolk: Boydell, 1998), pp. 46–51.</p>
<p>2.25 As the Franks were unable to put up any resistance to the
pagans, and saw that the whole of Francia was verging on annihilation,
they came to the king with one accord, and said to him:</p>
<p>“Why will you not come to the aid of the kingdom which you ought to
‘preside over and profit’ with the scepter? Why not buy peace through
conciliation, since we are unable to get it either through war, or by
any sort of defensive precaution? The king’s honor and the king’s power
are brought low, and the insolence of the heathen is raised up. The land
allotted to the Franks is considered no better than a desert, for its
population is either dead through famine or the sword, or is perhaps in
captivity. Protect your kingdom: if not by arms, then by counsel.”</p>
<p>Then was King Charles enraged, and he spoke these words: “Then give
me the counsel which will be salutary and appropriate for the kingdom
and for us.”</p>
<p>Then said the Franks: “If you will trust us, we will give you advice
fitting and wholesome for you and for the kingdom, so that the people,
who are all too stricken with want, may have repose. Let the land from
the River Andelle to the sea be given to the pagan peoples; and in
addition, join your daughter to Rollo in marriage. And thereby you will
be able to grow mightily in power against the peoples who resist you;
for Rollo is born of the proud blood of kings and of chiefs; he is very
fair of body, a ready fighter, far-sighted in counsel, seemly in
appearance, amenable to us, a faithful friend to those to whom he gives
his word, a ferocious enemy to those whom he opposes, a constant and
amenable vassal in all things, with a shrewd mind, such as we need. He
is well-versed in speech, teachable in affairs, kindly in his deeds,
honorable in his eloquence, full of manly courage, humble in his
manners, most prudent in forensic matters, just in judgment, most
careful in keeping of secrets, very rich in gold and silver, strictly
attended by a most numerous throng of warriors—nay, he is fully endowed
with all kinds of good qualities.”</p>
<p>Having consulted these men, Charles at once sent Franco, the
archbishop of Rouen, to Rollo, leader of the pagans, As soon as he came
to him, he began to address him with gentle words: “Most outstanding of
all leaders, and most excellent of all men, do you mean to spend your
whole life pursuing your quarrel against the Franks? Will you always be
battling against them? What will become of you, should you be snatched
away by death before your time? Whose creation are you? Do you think
that you are God? Is not a man a thing fashioned from mud? Are you not
the food of worms, and dust and ashes? Remember what you are and what
you will be, and by whose judgment you will be condemned. It is my
belief that ‘you will have hell to enjoy’; and after your battles are
over, ‘you will do no more harm to anyone.’ If you wish to become a
Christian, you will be able to know peace, now and in future, and to
remain in this land as a man of great wealth. The most long-suffering
King Charles, led by the advice of his men, is willing to give you this
coast-land too often laid waste by Hastings and by you. Moreover, so
that peace and agreement and firm, stable, and continuous friendship may
endure between you and him for all times, he will give you his daughter,
called Gisla, in marriage as your wife. If you will have the joy of
offspring through this union, you will hold the kingdom in
perpetuity.”</p>
<p>2.26 When he had heard this, he called together the Danish chiefs,
and told them what the bishop had said to him. And the Danes remembered
the interpretations of the dream, and said to Rollo: “This utterly
desolated land, bereft of warriors and untilled by the plow, is full of
good trees, is intersected by rivers stocked with various sorts of fish;
it teems with game, is not unfamiliar with vines, bears fruit in soil
worked by the plow, is hemmed in on one side by a sea which will afford
an abundant wealth of different commodities, and on the other by the
outflow of waters carrying all sorts of goods by ship. It is virtually
distinct from the kingdom of Francia, and if it were occupied by a dense
population it would be mightily fertile and very rich, sufficient and
suitable for us to inhabit. The girl whom he is promising you is
lawfully born of the seed of either parent. She is tall enough, and her
shape, we have heard, is most rare; she is a most unsullied virgin,
provident in counsel, careful in her public dealings, most pleasant in
her manner, most affable in her speech, highly skilled in handiwork.
Indeed, she is the most outstanding of all virgins, and it is right that
she be joined to you in wedded affection. And so the plan which seems to
us the best, the most profitable, and proof against any misguided
quarreling, is that you should have the king’s daughter joined to you in
marriage.</p>
<p>“Remember the interpretation of the dream, and its mystical meaning.
As we see it, things will turn out better for us within this territory.
Enough have we battled and beaten the Franks; it seems right to us that
we should take our ease, and quietly enjoy the fruits of the earth. Send
the bishop back to the king, so that he may say that you are ready to be
at his service if he gives you what he has promised. Give him three
secure months of peace, as well, so that if he wants, he may come within
the period of truce to meet you in public, and make entirely sure of his
words and promises.”</p>
<p>Rollo told the bishop forthwith that he was sending him back to the
king to say these things to him. When he came to the king, and when the
bishops had been convoked with a gathering of counts and abbots, he
said: “Rollo, the leader of the Northmen, will offer you his hands in
submission as a token of fealty, and he pledges love and inviolable
friendship toward you, and even his service, if you will give him your
daughter, as you have said, to be his wife, and the coast-land as a
perpetual possession for the progeny of his progeny; and he will not
cease to perform service to you, and you will be able with his help to
crush the risings of opponents and rebels against you, and regain your
power much strengthened.”</p>
<p>When these words had been brought back by the bishop, the Franks
wished each other joy, and with one mind proposed to the king that he
give his daughter and the land to Rollo. And the king, urged on by the
request of the Franks, gave his daughter to the bishop as Rollo’s proxy,
for a pledge, guaranteed by a jointly sworn oath. When the details of
these matters had been worked out, settled and confirmed, and the place
and time were determined, and the truce had been arranged, each went
back to his own people. Franco, the archbishop of Rouen, went to Rollo
and explained to him what he had done in an orderly narrative. And so,
when these words had been reported to him, Rollo and his men were filled
with great joy, and they called to mind the symbolic interpretation of
the dream.</p>
<p>2.27 Now when Duke Robert heard that King Charles would give his
daughter to Rollo, and that they would make peace with one another, and
that there would be peace for the whole kingdom, he sent a messenger to
Rollo with peaceable words to say to him the following words. And when
he arrived he spoke to Rollo with words of entreaty: “Robert, duke of
the Franks [sends his] faithful service to you. He has heard of the
agreement between you and the king, and he rejoices greatly thereat. He
says it is right that you and your men should rest, and rebuild the land
given to you, and restore the cities and buildings and live in perpetual
peace. Enough wars have been waged: enough have you proved your manly
skill at arms. Enough have you made known the temper of your valor,
enough have you undergone many dangers, enough have you proved your
worth as a vassal, enough have you been praised by the whole world. Nay,
even the duke himself kneels to you in his mind, and entreats you and
charges you that when you have avowed the name of Christ and have been
washed in the health-giving font of baptism, you will allow yourself to
be raised up by him. From then onwards, if it please you, you two will
be firm and inseparable friends, and ‘no man will be able to stand
against you,’ and he will always do you service, and make the king ever
look kindly upon you.”</p>
<p>When this had been said, Rollo took the advice of bishop Franco and
of his counts, and said: “I wish to do as the king and the Franks want:
let him come to the appointed meeting and receive me when I have been
immersed in the font. Let this man be to me as a father with fatherly
love; I will be a son to him, with the love of sons. Let him aid me, if
need be, as a father aids a son; I, him, as a son aids a father. Let him
rejoice in my prosperity, and sorrow in my adversity. What is in my
possession will be his by right, and what is mine by right shall be his
possession.”</p>
<p>And so the intermediary reported to duke Robert what he had
heard.</p>
<p>2.28 And so at the time agreed they came to the appointed place,
which is called St. Clair. And Rollo’s army sat on this side of the rive
Epte, and the king’s and Robert’s on the other. Without delay, Rollo
sent the archbishop to the king of the Franks, to say to him what had to
be said: “Rollo cannot make peace with you, because the land you wish to
give him is untilled by the plow, altogether bereft of sheep-flocks and
herds of cattle, and void of human occupation. Therein is not to be
found the means to support life, unless by robbery and raiding. Give him
some kingdom from which he can fetch food and clothing for himself until
the land which you give him is filled with collected wealth and in time
will render to you a harvest in food, men, and beasts. Moreover, he will
not be reconciled to you, unless you swear by an oath of the Christian
faith, you and the archbishops and the bishops and the counts and abbots
of the whole kingdom, that he may hold the land you give him for himself
and for his successors, as if it were his private and allodial land
[land owned absolutely], in perpetuity: that land from the stream of the
Epte as far as the sea.”</p>
<p>Then Robert, duke of the Franks, and the counts and bishops who were
present along with the abbots, said to the king: “You will not have as
honorable a duke as this one, unless you do what he desires. If you will
not give him what he asks of you in return for his service, give it to
him at least for his adopting the Christian religion, in order that so
great a people may be won over to Christ after being ensnared by
devilish error; and to prevent the authority of the whole of your realm
and of the church from being brought to nothing by the assault of a
hostile army, when you hold office as its advocate and protector in lieu
of Christ and ought to be the most constant king and advocate.”</p>
<p>Then the king wanted to give him the land of Flanders, so that he
might live off it; but Rollo would not accept it, on account of the
obstructive marshes. Therefore the king undertook to give him Brittany,
which was on the frontier of the promised land. Thereupon, Robert and
bishop Franco reported everything back to Rollo, and when hostages had
been given, they brought him to king Charles under the safe conduct of a
Christian oath. And when the Franks gazed on Rollo, who had overrun the
whole of Francia, they said to each other: “Great is the power of this
leader, great his valor, and great his counsel and his wisdom; and great
his labor, too, for having waged so many battles against the counts of
this kingdom.”</p>
<p>Urged on by the words of the Franks, he immediately put his hands
between the hands of the king [in the ceremony of homage], which neither
his father, nor his grandfather, nor his great-grandfather had done for
any man. And so the king gave his daughter, Gisla by name, to be the
wife of that same duke, and he gave the specified territory from the
river Epte to the sea as an allod and property; and the whole of
Brittany to live off.</p>
<p>2.29 Rollo was unwilling to kiss the king’s foot, and the bishops
said: “He who accepts a gift such as this ought to go as far as kissing
the king’s foot.” And he replied: “I will never bow my knees at the
knees of any man, and no man’s foot will I kiss.”</p>
<p>And so, urged on by the prayers of the Franks, he ordered one of his
warriors to kiss the king’s foot. And the man immediately grasped the
king’s foot and raised it to his mouth and planted a kiss on it while he
remained standing, and laid the king flat on his back. So there arose a
great laugh, and a great outcry among the people. Apart from that, King
Charles and Duke Robert and the counts and nobles swore an oath on the
Catholic faith to the patrician Rollo, on their own life and limbs, and
by the honor of the whole kingdom, that he should in addition hand on to
his heirs the appointed territory as he himself held and owned it, and
that the lineage of his sons and grandsons should hold and cultivate it
through the course of all time….</p>
<p>2.30 And so, in the 912th year from the incarnation of Our Lord Jesus
Christ, archbishop Franco baptized Rollo, after he had been instructed
in the Catholic faith of the Holy Trinity; and Robert, duke of the
Franks, received him from the font of the Savior, bestowed his name upon
him, and honorably enriched him with great rewards and gifts. And
Robert, also known as Rollo, had his counts and knights and the whole
complement of his army baptized and instructed in the observances of the
Christian faith by preaching.</p>
<p>After that, bishop Franco was summoned and asked which churches
within his land were held in greater respect, and which should be called
the more powerful for the merit and protection afforded by the
saints….</p>
<p>So, on the first day of baptism, Robert gave a huge estate to God and
to Saint Mary at Rouen church, to be held by the canons in perpetuity.
On the second day, to the church of Saint Mary at Bayeux. On the third
day, to the church of Saint Mary at Évreux. On the fourth, to the church
of the archangel Michael, which is ringed about by the intermittent
flooding of the stormy sea, swollen according to the phases of the moon
in seven-day patterns. On the fifth, to the church of Saint Peter and
Saint Ouen. On the sixth, to the church of Saint Peter and Saint Aicard
of Jumièges. On the seventh he gave Berneval with all its dependencies
to Saint Denis.</p>
<p>2.31 On the eighth day of his expiation, he took off his baptismal
and chrismal vestments, and began to measure out land for his counts by
word of mouth, and to enrich his followers. Then, when preparation for a
splendid wedding had been made, he married the king’s daughter Gisla as
his wife, and so reconciled himself to the Franks and made peace. He
placed all the nations which desired to remain within his land under his
protection. He divided that land among his followers by measure, and
rebuilt everything that had been long deserted, and restored it by
restocking it with his own warriors and with peoples from abroad. He
imposed everlasting privileges and laws on the people, authorized and
decreed by the will of the chief men, and he compelled them to dwell
together in peace. He raised up churches that had been demolished to the
ground, he rebuilt temples that had been ruined by the visitations of
the heathens, and he made new and extended the walls and defenses of
cities. He subdued the Britons who resisted him, and he amply victualed
the whole of the realm that had been granted to him from the Breton
food-renders….</p>
<p>Chapter Nine</p>
<hr />
<p>Austrveg: The Viking Road to the East</p>
<p>Scandinavian expansion in the East, dominated by the Swedes, was an
outgrowth of pre-Viking Age activities in the southeastern Baltic. From
about the second half of the eighth century, Scandinavians were living
at the trading center at Staraya (Old) Ladoga (known as Aldeigjuborg by
the Scandinavians), just off Lake Ladoga on the river Volkhov. With the
exception of places where ships had to be portaged to avoid rapids or to
get from the headland of one river to another, it was possible to sail
by river all the way from the Baltic to the Caspian Sea. This was the
austrvegr, the way to the East, or the “Viking road to Byzantium.” Trade
was the driving force of this eastward expansion. Viking merchants
traded furs, honey, wax, walrus ivory, high-grade weapons, and slaves,
obtaining in return Arab silver—tens of thousands of coins have been
found in Viking Age hoards. Not all Viking voyages to the East were
peaceful, however, and commerce was often inseparable from fighting.</p>
<p>Two terms, Rūs and Væringjar (Varangian), are used in Western and
Eastern sources to describe the Swedish Vikings in the East. Although
this point is contentious, Rūs is probably derived from the Finnish name
for the Swedes, Ruotsi, which itself is probably derived from an Old
Swedish word meaning something like “rowers” or “seamen.” It was the Rūs
who gave their name to Russia, although the extent to which they
influenced state formation there has been hotly contested by scholars
for decades. From the mid-tenth century the term Varangian also came
into use. It may be derived from the Old Norse vár (pledge), with
reference to the groups of merchant-adventurers who bound themselves
into companies and swore to support each other. The term was also used
for foreign mercenaries but does not seem to have had specific ethnic
associations.</p>
