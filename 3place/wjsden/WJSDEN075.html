of the Siege of Paris, 885–886 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Abbo was a monk of St-Germain-des-Prés near Paris and wrote a Latin
poem about the Norse assaults on Paris in 885–886 and 896.</p>
<p>Source: trans. F.A. Ogg, A Source Book for Mediaeval History:
Documents Illustrative of European Life and Institutions from the German
Invasions to the Renaissance (New York: American Book Company, 1908),
pp. 168–71; revised by P.E. Dutton, Carolingian Civilization: A Reader,
2nd ed. (Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press, 2004), pp. 514–16.</p>
<ol start="885" type="1">
<li>[The Northmen] came to Paris with 700 sailing ships, not counting
those of smaller size which are commonly called barques. At one stretch
the Seine was lined with the vessels for more than two leagues, so that
one might ask in astonishment in what cavern the river had been
swallowed up, for nothing was visible there, since ships covered that
[river] as if with oak trees, elms, and alders. On the second day after
the fleet of the Northmen arrived under the walls of the city, Sigfried,
who was then king only in name but who was in command of the expedition,
came to the dwelling of the illustrious bishop. He bowed his head and
said: “Gauzelin, have compassion on yourself and on your flock. We
beseech you to listen to us, in order that you may escape death. Allow
us only the freedom of the city. We will do no harm and we will see to
it that whatever belongs either to you or to Odo shall be strictly
respected.” Count Odo, who later became king, was then the defender of
the city. The bishop replied to Siegfried, “Paris has been entrusted to
us by the Emperor Charles, who, after God, king and lord of the
powerful, rules over almost all the world. He has put it in our care,
not at all that the kingdom may be ruined by our misconduct, but that he
may keep it and be assured of its peace. If, like us, you had been given
the duty of defending these walls, and if you should have done that
which you ask us to do, what treatment do you think you would deserve?”
Siegfried replied, “I should deserve that my head be cut off and thrown
to the dogs. Nevertheless, if you do not listen to my demand, on the
morrow our war machines will destroy you with poisoned arrows. You will
be the prey of famine and of pestilence and these evils will renew
themselves perpetually every year.” So saying, he departed and gathered
together his comrades.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the morning the Northmen, boarding their ships, approached the
tower and attacked it. [The tower blocked access to the city by the
so-called Great Bridge, which connected the right bank of the Seine with
the island on which the city was built. The tower stood on the present
site of the Châtelet.] They shook it with their engines and stormed it
with arrows. The city resounded with clamor, the people were aroused,
the bridges trembled. All came together to defend the tower. There Odo,
his brother Robert, and the Count Ragenar distinguished themselves for
bravery; likewise the courageous Abbot Ebolus, the nephew of the bishop.
A keen arrow wounded the prelate, while at his side the young warrior
Frederick was struck by a sword. Frederick died, but the old man, thanks
to God, survived. For many this was their last moment of life, but they
inflicted bitter blows on many of the enemy. At last the enemy withdrew,
carrying off a vast number of Danish dead. Now Apollo, having followed
Olympus, turned toward the west, to further Thule and the southern
regions [i.e., the evening came].</p>
<p>No longer did the tower appear as fine as it once did, but its
conditions were still solid and it delighted a little in the windows
that had been opened up to the sun. The people spent the night repairing
the holes with boards. By the next day, on the old citadel had been
erected a new tower of wood, a half higher than the former one. In the
morning the sun and the Danes fell on the tower together. They engaged
the [Christians] in violent skirmishes. On every side arrows sped and
blood flowed. With the arrows mingled the stones hurled by slings and
war-machines; the air was filled with them. The tower which had been
built during the night groaned under the strokes of the darts, the city
shook with the struggle, the people ran hither and thither, the bells
jangled. The warriors rushed together to defend the tottering tower and
to repel the fierce assault.</p>
<p>Among these warriors two, a count and an abbot [Ebolus], surpassed
all the rest in courage. The former was the redoubtable Odo who never
experienced defeat and who continually revived the spirits of the
worn-out defenders. He ran along the ramparts and hurled back the enemy.
On those who were secreting themselves so as to undermine the tower he
poured oil, wax, and pitch, which, being mixed and heated, burned the
Danes and tore off their scalps. Some of them died; others threw
themselves into the river to escape the awful substance….</p>
<p>Meanwhile Paris was suffering not only from the sword outside but
also from a pestilence within which brought death to many noble men.
Within the walls there was not ground in which to bury the dead…. Odo,
the future king, was sent to Charles, emperor of the Franks, to implore
help for the stricken city.</p>
<p>One day Odo, powerful with his arms, suddenly appeared on Montmartre
in splendor in the midst of three bands of warriors. The sun made his
armor glisten and greeted him before it illuminated the country around.
The Parisians saw their beloved chief at a distance, but the enemy,
hoping to prevent his gaining entrance to the tower, crossed the Seine
and took up their position on the bank. Nevertheless Odo, his horse at a
gallop, got past the Northmen and reached the tower, whose gates Ebolus
opened to him. The enemy pursued fiercely the comrades of the count who
were trying to keep up with him and get refuge in the tower…. [The Danes
were defeated in the attack.]</p>
<p>Now came the emperor Charles [the Fat], surrounded by soldiers of all
nations, even as the sky is adorned with resplendent stars. A great
throng, speaking many languages, accompanied him. He established his
camp at the foot of the heights of Montmartre, near the tower. He
allowed the Northmen to have the country of Sens to plunder; and in the
spring he gave them 700 pounds of silver on condition that by the month
of March they leave France for their own kingdom. Then Charles returned
[home], destined to an early death.</p>
