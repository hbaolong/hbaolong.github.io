<h4 id="the-england-runestones">105. The England Runestones</h4>
<p>Approximately 30 runestones record expeditions to England. The
runestones date mainly from the reign of Knut the Great (see doc. 104)
and provide fascinating details of Danish activities in England. Most of
the England runestones commemorate the achievements of Swedish
warriors.</p>

<li>The following inscription is found on one of a group of stones
commemorating Ulf of Borresta, a Viking who lived in Uppland in the late
tenth and early eleventh centuries. Ulf profited from distribution of
the Danegeld (a tribute paid by the Anglo-Saxons) under three leaders:
Skoglar Tosti, from Västergötland (in Sweden), who raised his first
Danegeld in England in 970; Thorkell the Tall, who levied a large
Danegeld in 1011 and commanded the troops who martyred Saint Alfeah (see
doc. 103); and Knut the Great, who became king of England in 1016.</li>

<li>The Earldom of Orkney at its Zenith</li>
</ol>
<p>Although technically subject to Norway, the Norse earls of Orkney
were powerful rulers in their own right. Modern scholarship agrees that
the Orkney earldom reached the apex of its power in the time of Earl
Thorfinn Sigurdarson the Mighty (ca 1009–ca 1064), who was reckoned in
Orkneyinga saga as the most powerful earl. During his long tenure of the
earldom, Thorfinn gained a reputation as a formidable warrior and was
said to have subjugated nine Scottish earldoms, the Hebrides, and part
of Ireland, though modern scholarship regards these claims as
exaggerated. Thorfinn was also the first earl of Orkney who was brought
up as a Christian. He went on a pilgrimage to Rome ca 1050 and
established the first bishopric in Orkney at Birsay on the west
mainland, his principal residence. The latter part of his reign was
given over to the administration of the earldom. His career is outlined
in the first part of Orkneyinga saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A. A. Somerville, from Orkneyinga saga, ed. Finnbogi
Guðmundsson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXIV (Reykjavík, 1965), pp. 43, 56,
71–83.</p>
<ol start="20" type="1">
<li>Earl Thorfinn became a great leader. He was very tall and had
immense strength. In appearance, he was ugly, with black-hair,
sharp-features, a long nose, and a swarthy complexion. He was an
energetic man, ambitious for both wealth and fame, and since he was not
only courageous but also skilled in battle, he was usually victorious.
When he was five years old, his grandfather, Malcolm, king of Scots
[Malcolm II, ca 980–1034] gave him the title of earl and made him ruler
of Caithness. When he was fourteen years old, he began making forays
outside his own lands and raiding the territory of other
chieftains….</li>
</ol>
<p>Earl Thorfinn behaved magnificently in the Orkneys. He provided his
entire bodyguard and many other powerful men with food and ale
throughout the winter, so that they didn’t have to go to an inn. In
other lands, kings and earls usually provide their bodyguard with food
and drink only at Yule….</p>
<p>[Thorfinn’s power was threatened only once, by his nephew Rognvald
Brusason. The sea-battle in which Thorfinn defeated his nephew is
described in document 37b. The following passage tells the story of
Rognvald’s last, desparate attempt to overthrow his uncle. After this,
Thorfinn was never seriously challenged.]</p>
<ol start="28" type="1">
<li>When Earl Rognvald landed in the Shetlands, he learned that Earl
Thorfinn was in the Orkneys and that he had only a few men with him
since he didn’t anticipate trouble in the depths of winter. So, Rognvald
headed south for the Orkneys without delay. Meanwhile, Earl Thorfinn was
in Hrossey, unaware of any danger. When he reached the Orkneys, Rognvald
made straight for the place where he had been told that Thorfinn was
living. He arrived so unexpectedly that he and his men were able to
block all the doors of Thorfinn’s house before anyone had an inkling of
what was happening.</li>
</ol>
<p>It was night time and almost everyone was asleep, but Earl Thorfinn
was still sitting up drinking. Rognvald and his men set fire to the
house, and as soon as Thorfinn became aware of the situation he sent men
to find out who was responsible for the fire. When they were told that
it was Earl Rognvald who had arrived, they all leapt for their weapons,
but they couldn’t mount any resistance because they couldn’t get
outside. Before long the house was ablaze, so Thorfinn told his men to
ask the earl to let them out. Rognvald allowed all the women and slaves
to leave but, as for the men, he said he would prefer most of them dead.
Then the people who had been spared were pulled from the building and
after that the house was quickly engulfed by fire.</p>
<p>Earl Thorfinn tore away a piece of wainscotting from the house and
jumped out with his wife Ingibjorg in his arms. The night was
pitch-dark, so he got away under cover of the smoke, without Earl
Rognvald’s men noticing him. That very night, he rowed across to
Caithness, alone in a small boat. Earl Rognvald burned down the entire
building along with all the men who had not been allowed out. It didn’t
occur to anyone that Earl Thorfinn had not died there.</p>
<p>After that, Earl Rognvald traveled the length and breadth of the
islands and brought all of them under his control. He sent word across
to Caithness and also to the Hebrides that he was claiming all the land
that had belonged to Earl Thorfinn; no one made any objection. Earl
Thorfinn hid with friends in various parts of Caithness and not a
whisper got out that he had escaped the burning.</p>
<ol start="29" type="1">
<li>Earl Rognvald took up residence in Kirkwall and laid in all the
provisions that he would need for his winter quarters. He had a large
crowd of followers and lived in great state. Shortly before Yule, Earl
Rognvald and many of his men went over to Little Papey to fetch the malt
for the Yule brewing. Late in the evening, as they sat around a roasting
fire on the island, the man who was looking after the fire remarked that
they were running out of firewood. Then the earl made a slip of the
tongue. What he said was, “We’ll be very old before these fires burn
out.” What he meant to say was, “We’ll be very well-roasted before these
fires burn out.” He noticed his slip immediately and said,</li>
</ol>
<p>“As far as I can recall, I’ve never misspoken before, but I do
remember what my foster-father, King Olaf, said to me at Stiklastad,
when I caught him out in a slip of the tongue. He told me that if I ever
happened to mis-speak I should be prepared to die soon afterwards. So
perhaps my uncle Thorfinn is still alive.”</p>
<p>At that very moment they realized that the house had been surrounded.
Earl Thorfinn had arrived. Straightaway, he and his men set fire to the
house and piled up wood in front of the doors. Earl Thorfinn allowed
everyone to leave except Rognvald’s men. After most of the people had
been brought out, a man dressed in a linen garment appeared in the
doorway. Thorfinn told his men to lend the deacon a hand, but the man
pressed down with his hands on the wood at the doorway, and vaulted over
both the wood and the men encircling the door. He landed well beyond
them and quickly disappeared into the darkness. Earl Thorfinn ordered
his men to catch him.</p>
<p>“It must have been Rognvald who got away,” he said. “No one else is
strong enough to do that.”</p>
<p>So they separated into groups and went to look for him. Thorkel the
Fosterer was searching along the seashore when a dog was heard barking
among the rocks beside the sea—Rognvald had taken his lap-dog with him,
and the dog had given him away. They killed him there and then among the
rocks, and the story goes that it was Thorkel the Fosterer who killed
him. No one else would do it, but Thorkel had taken an oath to do
anything that would help Thorfinn regain his power. Thorfinn and his men
spent the night on the island; all the men who had gone there with
Rognvald were slain.</p>
<p>In the morning, they loaded a cargo ship with malt. When they boarded
the ship, they did not remove Rognvald’s shields from the bow and they
made sure that no more men were visible than had gone with Rognvald to
the island. They rowed to Kirkwall and the people there thought that
Earl Rognvald was coming back. So they went to meet him and most of them
were unarmed. Earl Thorfinn had thirty men seized and executed. Most
were retainers and friends of King Magnus of Norway, but the earl spared
one of them and ordered him to go back to Norway and tell King Magnus
what had happened.</p>
<ol start="30" type="1">
<li><p>Earl Rognvald’s body was taken to Greater Papey where it was
buried. The general opinion was that he had been the most popular and
accomplished of all the earls of Orkney, and many people mourned his
passing…. After that, Earl Thorfinn brought all of the Orkneys under his
control, and no one put up any resistance. Early in the spring, news of
these events reached Norway. King Magnus was greatly upset by the loss
of Earl Rognvald and said that he would avenge him as soon as he could.
But at that particular time, he was involved in hostilities against
Svein Ulfsson, who had recently become king of Denmark. At that time
too, he had just given half his kingdom to his uncle Harald Sigurdarson
who had returned to Norway….</p></li>
<li><p>Earl Thorfinn now had undisputed authority over the Orkneys and
all the rest of his territories…. Occasionally, he went on Viking
expeditions to the west, pillaging in Scotland and Ireland. He also
spent some time in England where he was in charge of the royal bodyguard
for a while.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When Earl Thorfinn heard of King Magnus’s death, he sent messengers
to Norway to assure King Harald of his good will and to ask him for his
friendship. King Harald received the message favorably and promised
Thorfinn his friendship. As soon as he received this reply, Earl
Thorfinn got ready for a voyage and set off from the Orkneys with two
twenty-bench longships and more than a hundred well-chosen men. He
sailed east to Norway and met the king in Hordaland. Harald welcomed him
warmly and gave him many fine gifts when they parted.</p>
<p>From there, the earl sailed south along the coast and kept going
until he reached Denmark. He traveled across the country and met King
Svein at Alaborg [Aalborg]. The king invited Thorfinn to stay with him
and held splendid feasts in his honor. Then the earl revealed his
intention of going on a pilgrimage to Rome.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Saxony, the earl met the emperor Henry [III] who
received him warmly and gave him many rich gifts. The emperor also
supplied him with many horses for his journey south. Then he traveled to
Rome where he met the pope [Leo IX] and was absolved of all his
sins.</p>
<p>After that, he made his way home and got back to his realm safe and
sound. He gave up raiding and turned his attention to governing his
people and lands, and to establishing laws. He resided permanently in
Birsay and there he built Christchurch, a magnificent church that was
the first cathedral in Orkney.</p>
<p>Earl Thorfinn married Ingibjorg Earls’ Mother. They had two sons who
survived childhood. Their names were Paul and Erlend and they were big,
good-looking men who took after their mother’s side of the family. They
were also intelligent and good-natured and the earl loved them dearly,
as did all his people.</p>
<ol start="32" type="1">
<li>Earl Thorfinn retained control of his realm until the day he died.
He was certainly the most powerful of the earls of Orkney, for his rule
extended over nine earldoms in Scotland as well as the whole of the
Hebrides and extensive lands in Ireland. Arnor Jarlaskald [Poet of
Earls] says the following:</li>
</ol>
<p>The folk obeyed the feeder of</p>
<p>ravens from Thurs Rocks to Dublin;</p>
<p>I tell the people truly</p>
<p>what manner of man was Thorfinn.</p>
<p>Thorfinn was five years old when his maternal grandfather, Malcolm,
king of Scots, gave him the title of earl, and he remained an earl for
seventy [probably 50] more years. He died shortly before Harald
Sigurdarson [d. 1066] and is buried in Christchurch, which he himself
had built. The earl was deeply lamented in the lands he had inherited,
but in the territories he had won by force, many people felt downtrodden
under his rule. So after his death, several of these territories
revolted and the people sought the protection of the chiefs who were the
hereditary owners of the land. It soon became evident what a serious
loss Earl Thorfinn’s death was.</p>
<p>The following verses were composed about the sea-battle between Earl
Rognvald Brusason and Earl Thorfinn [by Arnor Jarlaskald]:</p>
<p>It was a disastrous day when</p>
<p>the earls engaged in battle;</p>
<p>many a man learned to die</p>
<p>in the fierce fighting;</p>
<p>men dear to me were close to killing</p>
<p>one another, when war’s</p>
<p>flame flashed before Robery</p>
<p>where many a fine man was wounded.</p>
<p>The bright sun will blacken,</p>
<p>earth sink under the dark sea,</p>
<p>the sky will splinter,</p>
<p>seas surge over the mountains,</p>
<p>before a lovelier lord</p>
<p>than Thorfinn</p>
<p>is bred in the Orkney Isles;</p>
<p>God help that guardian of warriors.</p>
<p>Chapter Fourteen</p>
<hr />
<p>The End of the Viking Age</p>
<p>A variety of markers have been suggested for the end of the Viking
Age. These include the conversion of the Scandinavians to Christianity
and their assimilation into western European religious culture (see
chapter 12); the development of unitary Christian kingships in
Scandinavia, which brought the kingdoms of the region into line with
other European kingdoms (see chapter 13); and military events such as
the defeat of King Harald Sigurdarson of Norway at the Battle of
Stamford Bridge in September 1066, often cited as the last large-scale
Viking expedition. A case might be made for seeing the reign of Hakon IV
of Norway (1217–63) as bringing the age to an end. His Scottish
expedition in 1263 was the last serious Norse intervention in the
affairs of the British Isles.</p>
<p>Yet history seldom provides neat divisions between more or less
arbitrary “ages,” and because of the extensive nature of the
Scandinavian diaspora it is difficult to identify a single date that has
meaning throughout the entire Viking world. Moreover, as the preceding
chapters have demonstrated, the Viking Age itself was not a monolithic
chronological period spanning some three or four centuries but was in
fact marked by a variety of distinct phases of activity, and by both
continuity and change. In the end, it is probably unwise to look for a
single terminal moment for the Viking Age.</p>
