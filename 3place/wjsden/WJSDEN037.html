<h4 id="a-how-gudrun-divorced-thorvald-aaaaaaaa">(a) How Gudrun Divorced
Thorvald AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>While surviving (Christian) law codes are ambivalent about divorce,
the sagas suggest a situation in which divorce appears to have been
easily available to either partner in a marriage, as is the case in this
passage from The Saga of the People of Laxdale.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 93–94.</p>
<ol start="34" type="1">
<li>There was a man called Thorvald, the son of Halldor the Godi
[chieftain] of Garpsdal. He lived in Garpsdal at Gilsfjord and was a
prosperous man, but not very brave. He asked to marry Gudrun
Osvifrsdaughter at the Althing when she was fifteen years old. The offer
was not badly received but Osvifr remarked that as far as marriage went,
he and Gudrun were not evenly matched. Thorvald responded mildly and
said that he was asking for a wife, not money. So Gudrun was betrothed
to Thorvald and, on his own, Osvifr drew up a contract by which it was
agreed that Gudrun would have sole control of their property as soon as
they occupied one bed, and that she would own half their property no
matter how long or short a time they lived together. Thorvald was also
obliged to buy costly possessions for her so that no woman of equal
wealth would have better and he was to keep up the stock on his farm
despite these expenses. Then everyone rode home from the Thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gudrun wasn’t asked about this arrangement and she was miserable
about it, but didn’t make a fuss. The wedding feast took place at
Garpsdal in the fifth month of summer [late August, early September].
Gudrun cared little for Thorvald and was extravagant in making expensive
purchases. There were no costly items in the West Fjords that Gudrun
didn’t think she ought to have and she scolded Thorvald if he didn’t buy
them, however expensive they were.</p>
<p>Thord Ingunnarson became very friendly with Thorvald and Gudrun and
stayed with them for long periods. There was a lot of talk about the
intimacy between Gudrun and Thord. On one occasion, when Gudrun asked
Thorvald to buy her something expensive, he said that her demands were
insatiable and slapped her on the face. Then Gudrun said, “You have
given me a feature we women think it is very important to have in good
measure, and that is a high color. And you have persuaded me not to
pester you with excessive demands.”</p>
<p>When Thord arrived that evening on a visit, Gudrun told him about the
insult and asked how she should repay it. With a smile, Thord said, “I
know a good way of doing it. Make him a shirt with an opening shamefully
wide for a man and declare yourself separated from him because of that
effeminacy.” Gudrun said nothing against the idea and they ended their
conversation.</p>
<p>The same spring, Gudrun declared herself separated from Thorvald and
went back to Laugar. Later, their property was divided, and Gudrun got
half, though the property was now worth more than before. They had lived
together for two years.</p>
