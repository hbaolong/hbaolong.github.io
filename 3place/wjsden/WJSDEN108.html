<h4 id="thorfinn-karlsefni-in-vinland">78. Thorfinn Karlsefni in
Vinland</h4>
<p>Thorfinn Karlsefni made a serious attempt to settle in Vinland,
possibly in what is now the Gaspé region of Canada. His wife, Gudrid,
was perhaps the best-traveled woman in the Viking age. She was an
Icelander who traveled first to Greenland and then to Vinland. Later in
life, she went on a pilgrimage to Rome. From The Saga of the
Greenlanders.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Groenlendinga saga, in Eyrbyggja
saga, ed. Einar Ól. Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit IV
(Reykjavík, 1935), pp. 260–64, 268–69.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>That same summer, a ship came to Greenland from Norway and the
steersman of the ship was called Thorfinn Karlsefni. He was the son of
Thord Horsehead who was the son of Snorri Thordarson from Hofdi.
Thorfinn Karlsefni was a very prosperous man. He spent the winter with
Leif Eiriksson at Brattahlid. Soon, he directed his attentions to
Gudrid, and asked her to marry him. She asked Leif to answer for her.
Before long, she was engaged to Karlsefni and the wedding took place
that winter.</li>
</ol>
<p>There was the same talk as before about travel to Vinland, and people
were eager for Karlsefni to go, Gudrid among others. At length, he
decided to undertake the voyage and hired a crew of sixty men and five
women. He and his crew agreed that whatever goods they acquired would be
shared equally. They took all kinds of livestock with them as they meant
to settle the land if they could. Karlsefni asked Leif for the houses he
had built in Vinland, and Leif said that he would lend them, but not
give them.</p>
<p>Then they put to sea and arrived safe and well at Leif’s houses and
carried their hammocks up to them. Soon, they got their hands on rich
and plentiful provisions when a large, fresh rorqual [whale] was
stranded on the beach. After they had cut it up, there was no shortage
of food. They put their livestock out to pasture and soon the males
became ill-tempered and intractable. They had brought a bull with
them.</p>
<p>Karlsefni had timber felled as a cargo for his ship. The wood was
hewn up and laid on a rock to dry. They had their choice of the
available resources of the land—grapes and all kinds of game and
produce.</p>
<p>The first winter passed into summer. They became aware that there
were Skraelings [Native Americans] about when a large group of them came
out of the woods quite close to Karlsefni’s cattle. The bull began to
bellow and roar furiously, and this so terrified the Skraelings that
they took to their heels, carrying their packs full of gray fur, sable,
and all kinds of skins. They made for Karlsefni’s settlement and tried
to get into the houses, but Karlsefni had the doors bolted against them.
Neither side understood the other’s language.</p>
<p>The Skraelings put their bundles down, opened them and offered to
trade, especially for weapons, but Karlsefni forbade his men to part
with weapons. Instead, he came up with the following plan. He told the
women to take out milk and as soon as the Skraelings saw it, they wanted
to buy the milk and nothing else. The upshot of the trading trip was
that the Skraelings carried their goods away in their bellies while
Karlsefni and his companions kept the bags of skins. After this the
Skraelings left. Then Karlsefni had a sturdy fence built around his
settlement and they made themselves comfortable there.</p>
<p>About this time, Karlsefni’s wife, Gudrid, gave birth to a boy whom
they named Snorri.</p>
<p>Early in the second winter, the Skraelings came back again. This time
there were many more of them and they brought the same sorts of goods as
before. Then Karlsefni said to the women, “Take out the kind of food
that was most popular last time, but don’t take out anything else.” The
moment they saw it, the Skraelings threw their bundles in over the
fence.</p>
<p>Gudrid was sitting just inside the doorway beside her son Snorri’s
cradle. A shadow darkened the doorway and in came a woman wearing a
black tunic with a ribbon around her light chestnut hair. She was rather
short and pale and had the largest eyes ever seen in a human head. She
walked to where Gudrid sat.</p>
<p>“What are you called?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I’m called Gudrid. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“I’m called Gudrid [too,” she answered.]</p>
<p>Then Gudrid, Karlsefni’s wife, stretched out her hand to the woman,
inviting her to sit beside her, but at that precise moment there was a
great outburst of noise and the woman vanished. At that same moment, a
Skraeling was killed by one of Karlsefni’s men for attempting to make
off with some of their weapons. The Skraelings cleared off as fast as
they could, leaving their clothes and trade-goods behind. No one except
Gudrid had seen the woman.</p>
<p>“Now we need to come up with a plan,” said Karlsefni, “for I think
they’ll come back for a third visit, and this time they’ll be hostile
and more numerous. What we must do is this. Ten men should go over to
the headland and show themselves plainly. The rest of us should go into
the woods and cut a clearing where we can keep our cattle when the
Skraelings come out of the forest. We should take our bull and let him
go ahead of us.”</p>
<p>The place where they planned to fight the Skraelings was protected by
water on one side and by forest on the other.</p>
<p>Karlsefni’s plan was adopted. Before long, the Skraelings came to the
place Karlsefni had selected for the fight and many of them were killed
in the ensuing battle. Amongst the Skraelings, there was a tall,
handsome man, and Karlsefni concluded that he must be their chief. One
of the Skraelings had picked up an ax. He looked at the ax for a moment,
brandished it at one of his comrades and then struck him with it.
Instantly he fell down dead. The tall man took the ax and scrutinized
it. Then he threw it into the sea as far as he could. After that, the
Skraelings fled into the forest as quickly as possible, and that was the
end of the hostilities.</p>
<p>Karlsefni and his companions remained there for the whole winter, but
in spring, Karlsefni announced that he didn’t want to stay there any
longer and wished to return to Greenland. So they got ready for the
journey and took with them a great deal of produce, such as vines,
berries, and skins. They put to sea and arrived safely in Eiriksfjord
where they spent the winter….</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>…Then Karlsefni put to sea and arrived at Skagafjord in northern
Iceland where he beached his ship for the winter. In spring, he bought
land at Glaumbaer, set up a home and lived there for the rest of his
life. He was a highly regarded man, and he and his wife, Gudrid, had
many distinguished descendants.</li>
</ol>
<p>After Karlsefni died, the management of the farm was taken over by
Gudrid and her son, Snorri, who had been born in Vinland. When Snorri
married, Gudrid left Iceland and traveled on a pilgrimage to Rome. On
her return, she stayed with Snorri, who by then had built a church at
Glaumbaer. Afterwards, Gudrid became a nun and anchoress, and remained
there until she died….</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven</p>
<hr />
<p>Viking Life and Death</p>
<p>Svein Asleifarson, an Orkneyman of Norse descent, lived a definitely
Viking life. Viking raids were a part-time and seasonal occupation for
him. Following the rhythms of the agricultural year, he alternated
sowing and harvesting with forays as far south as Ireland, where he died
gloriously on his last autumn raid. Raiding and trading also flow
seamlessly together in Egil Skallagrimsson’s Baltic adventure. Rather
prosaically, Egil himself died comfortably in bed, but many other
individuals in this chapter have the opportunity to display the Germanic
hero’s sangfroid in the face of violence and inevitable death. The
chapter opens more pacifically with sound advice on sailing and trading,
a reminder that Vikings were merchants and explorers as well as
warriors.</p>
