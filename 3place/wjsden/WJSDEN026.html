<h4 id="c-the-death-of-baldur-the-good-aaaaaaaa">(c) The Death of Baldur
the Good AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Baldur, son of Odin, was associated with light and beauty in Norse
mythology. His death, which is greatly mourned by the Æsir, is momentous
in that it begins the process that will end with Ragnarok (the Doom of
the Gods). However, after Ragnarok, Baldur will rise again from the
kingdom of Hel to rule a bright new world together with the sons of
Thor.</p>
<p>The following passage is from Gylfaginning.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Edda.
Gylfaginning, ed. Anthony Faulkes (London: Viking Society for Northern
Research, 1988), pp. 45–47.</p>
<ol start="49" type="1">
<li>Then Gangleri said, “Have there been any other remarkable happenings
among the Æsir?…”</li>
</ol>
<p>The High One replied, “Here is an event that seemed…important to the
Æsir. The story begins when Baldur dreamt fearful dreams about his life.
When he told the Æsir about these dreams, they discussed the matter and
resolved to provide Baldur with immunity from all the dangers of life.
Frigg received oaths that they would not harm Baldur, from fire and
water, from iron and all kinds of metal, from rocks and soil, from trees
and illnesses, from animals and birds, from poison and snakes.”</p>
<p>When that was done and everyone had heard about it, the Æsir
entertained themselves by having Baldur stand up at assemblies and allow
the others to shoot at him, to cut at him, and to pelt him with stones;
and, no matter what they did to him, he was not harmed. Everyone thought
this was a real marvel.</p>
<p>But when Loki Laufeyarson saw that Baldur was not hurt, he was
displeased, so he adopted the shape of a woman and went to Fensala,
Frigg’s palace. Frigg asked this woman if she knew what the Æsir were up
to at their assembly. She replied that they were all pelting Baldur with
things without doing him any harm.</p>
<p>“Weapons and trees will not hurt Baldur,” said Frigg. “I have
received oaths from all of them.”</p>
<p>“Have absolutely all things sworn oaths not to harm Baldur?” asked
the woman.</p>
<p>“A little tree called mistletoe is sprouting to the west of
Valhalla,” answered Frigg, “and I thought it was too young to be asked
to swear the oath.”</p>
<p>At that, the woman went away, and Loki pulled up the mistletoe and
went to the meeting. Because he was blind, Hod stood alone outside the
circle of men who were throwing objects at Baldur. Loki asked him, “Why
aren’t you throwing things at Baldur?”</p>
<p>“Because I can’t see where Baldur is, and, anyway, I haven’t anything
to throw,” answered Hod.</p>
<p>“You should do what the others are doing and show Baldur the same
respect. I’ll lead you to where he’s standing, and you can throw this
twig at him,” said Loki.</p>
<p>Hod took the mistletoe and threw it at Baldur with guidance from
Loki. The twig pierced Baldur, and he fell to the ground, dead.</p>
<p>When Baldur fell, the Æsir were speechless and they couldn’t stir
themselves to lift him up. They looked at one another, and no one had
the least doubt about who had done the deed, but no one could take
revenge since their meeting place was such an important sanctuary. When
the Æsir attempted to speak, they were so overcome by weeping that no
one was able to express his grief in words. But Odin’s anguish was the
most painful, for he understood best how great a disaster for the Æsir
the death of Baldur was.</p>
<p>When the Æsir recovered themselves, Frigg asked who among them wanted
to win all her affections and favor by riding the road to Hel to look
for Baldur and offer Hel a ransom if she would permit him to return to
Asgard. Odin’s son Hermod was the one who undertook the journey. Then
Odin’s horse Sleipnir was caught and led forward; Hermod mounted the
horse and galloped off.</p>
<p>Next, the Æsir lifted Baldur’s body and moved it to the sea where lay
his ship Hringhorni, the finest of vessels. The gods wanted to launch
the ship and build Baldur’s funeral pyre on board, but Hringhorni would
not move an inch. So a summons was sent to Jotunheim [Giants’ Land] for
a giantess called Hyrrokkin. She arrived riding on a wolf with a
venomous snake for reins. She leapt from her mount, and Odin ordered
four berserks to look after it, but, until they had thrown it to the
ground, they were unable to control it. She went to the ship’s prow and
launched it with her first shove, which made the rollers burst into
flames, and caused the world to shake. Thor was furious; he seized his
hammer, intending to shatter her head, but all the gods begged him to
spare her.</p>
<p>Now Baldur’s body was carried out to the ship. When Baldur’s wife,
Nanna Nep’s daughter, saw this, she was overcome by grief and died. She
too was carried to the pyre which was then set alight. Next, Thor
stepped up to consecrate the pyre with Mjollnir, his hammer. But a dwarf
called Litr ran in front of his feet, so Thor kicked at him and shoved
him into the fire where he burned.</p>
<p>People of many nations attended this cremation. To mention Odin
first, he came with Frigg, the valkyries, and his ravens. Freyr came in
his carriage with the boar called Gullinbursti [Gold-Mane] or
Slidrugtanni [Terribly-Tusked]. Heimdall rode the horse called Gulltopp
[Gold-Tuft]. Freyja came drawn by her cats. There was also a great crowd
of ice-giants and mountaingiants. On the pyre, Odin placed a gold ring
called Draupnir which had the property of producing eight equally
valuable rings every ninth night. Baldur’s horse was led to the pyre
with all its harness.</p>
