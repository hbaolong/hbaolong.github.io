<h4 id="egil-in-youth-and-old-age">81. Egil in Youth and Old Age</h4>
<p>This passage from Egil’s Saga makes clear the connection between
trading and raiding in the sagas. Whatever the historicity of this
account, it is a splendid example of the narrative art of the saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar,
ed. Sigurður Nordal, Íslenzk fornrit II (Reykjavík, 1933), pp. 114–27,
294–98.</p>
<p>Egil in Youth</p>
<ol start="46" type="1">
<li>Thorolf and Egil spent the winter with Thorir and were treated very
hospitably, but in the spring, they got a large longship ready and
gathered a crew. During the summer, they raided in the east where they
fought a good many battles and acquired a great deal of plunder. Then
they made for Courland where they moored offshore and traded peacefully
for a couple of weeks. But when they were done with trading, they
started raiding again, going ashore at a number of different
places.</li>
</ol>
<p>One day they put in at a broad river mouth close to a huge forest.
They decided to land there and then split up into groups of twelve. They
went into the forest and before long they came across some settlements
where they began looting and killing. The inhabitants fled, so they met
with no resistance. Late in the day, Thorolf had the trumpets sounded to
recall the men to the beach. So, no matter where they were, they all
went back into the forest, because they had to return to the shore
before their numbers could be checked. Thorolf got back, but there was
no sign of Egil, and as darkness was falling, it seemed pointless to go
looking for him.</p>
<p>Egil and his twelve men made their way through the forest until they
came to a broad, open plain on which settlements had been built. A
farmstead stood nearby, so they headed toward it. As soon as they got
there, they rushed into the buildings, and since no one was about, they
seized everything of value. This took them quite a while since there
were so many buildings. When they left the farmstead, they found that a
band of armed men had come between them and the forest, and was
advancing to attack them.</p>
<p>There was a high fence stretching all the way from the farm to the
forest and Egil ordered his men to follow the line of the fence to
prevent the enemy from getting at them from all sides. He himself went
first and the rest followed hard on one another’s heels so that no one
could come between them. The Courlanders attacked them fiercely with
spears and arrows, but avoided close combat. Egil and his companions
followed along the fence and discovered too late that there was another
fence at right angles to the first one, so they could go no further.
They were cornered. Some of the Courlanders followed them into the pen
formed by the fences, while others attacked from the outside, thrusting
their swords and spears between the fence-posts. Still others threw
clothes onto their weapons. Egil and his men were wounded and captured.
Then they were bound and led back to the farm.</p>
<p>The owner of the farm was a rich and powerful man with a grown-up
son. They discussed what to do with the prisoners, and the farmer
thought it would be a good idea to kill them all in quick succession,
but his son replied that it was growing too dark to get any fun out of
torturing them and advised waiting till morning. So, they were thrown
into one of the farm buildings and trussed up tightly. Egil had his
hands and feet tied to a post. Then the building was locked up securely
and the Courlanders went into the main room where they ate and drank
with great merriment.</p>
<p>Egil strained and heaved at the post until he pried it loose from the
floor. It fell to the ground, and he was able to detach himself from it.
Then he untied his hands with his teeth, and when his hands were free,
he untied his feet. After that he set his comrades free, and they all
looked around for the best way out. The walls of the building were
constructed from huge logs, but at one end there was a partition made of
flat planking. They took a run at it and broke it down, only to find
themselves in another building that also had log walls.</p>
<p>Then they heard voices coming from beneath their feet, so they
investigated and found a trap-door in the floor. They opened it and
found a deep pit. This was where the men’s voices were coming from. Egil
asked who was there, and the man who answered said his name was Aki.
Egil asked him if he wanted out of the pit, and Aki replied that they
were desperate to get out. So Egil and his men took the rope they had
been tied with, lowered it into the pit, and hauled up three men.</p>
<p>Aki told them that these were his two sons and that they were Danes
who had been captured the previous summer.</p>
<p>“I was treated well during the winter,” said Aki, “for I did much of
the farm management, but my sons were treated like slaves and they
didn’t enjoy that at all. In the spring, we decided to run away, but we
were caught and imprisoned in this pit.”</p>
<p>“You must know how these buildings are laid out,” said Egil. “Where’s
the best place to get out?”</p>
<p>Aki said there was another plank partition. “Break through it, and
you’ll be in the barn, and you can find your way out of that easily
enough.”</p>
<p>So Egil and his men broke through the partition into the barn and
escaped from there. The night was pitch black, and Egil’s men wanted to
make for the woods as quickly as possible. But Egil said to Aki, “If
you’re familiar with the farmstead, you should be able to show us the
way to something worth stealing.” Aki said that there were lots of
valuable items for the taking: “And there’s a big loft where the farmer
sleeps; there’s no shortage of weapons in there.”</p>
<p>Egil told his men to go to the loft. When they reached the top of the
stairs, they saw that the loft was open. There was a light inside and
servants were making up beds. Egil sent some of the group outside to
make sure that no one escaped. Then he leapt into the loft and grabbed
some of the many weapons. He and his men killed everyone in the loft and
equipped themselves with arms. Then Aki pulled open a trapdoor in the
floor and told them to go down to the room below. So they took a light
and down they went. They found themselves in the farmer’s store room
that contained many valuable objects and a great deal of silver. Each
man gathered up an armload of treasure and carried it off, but Egil
picked up a large mead cask and put it under his arm. Then they headed
for the woods.</p>
<p>When they got there, Egil came to a halt and said, “This is no way
for warriors to behave. We’ve stolen the farmer’s property, but he
doesn’t know a thing about it—we should be ashamed of ourselves. Let’s
go back to the farm and tell them what’s been happening.”</p>
<p>Everyone else was against the idea. They said they wanted to return
to the ship, but Egil put down the mead cask and started running toward
the farm. When he got there, he saw manservants carrying serving dishes
from the kitchen to the main room. He also saw a large fire in the
kitchen with cooking pots over it. He went across to the fire. Great
logs had been brought in and the fire had been lit, as was the custom
there, by kindling one end of a log and letting it burn along its
length. Egil grabbed the log and carried it to the main room. He thrust
the burning end up under the eaves and into the bark roof where the
faggot lining quickly caught fire. He also found some dry wood lying
about and piled it outside the door. The drinkers in the main room
didn’t notice a thing until the roof was ablaze. Everyone rushed for the
door, but they couldn’t get out because of the piled wood, and because
Egil was blocking the doorway. He cut down men both in the doorway and
just in front of it. In next to no time, the house was engulfed with
flames and collapsed, and everyone inside perished.</p>
<p>Egil ran back to the forest where he was reunited with his
companions. They all went back to the ship, and for his share of the
plunder Egil claimed the mead cask he had carried off with him…it turned
out be full of silver. Thorolf and his men were overjoyed at Egil’s
return, and they set sail first thing in the morning. Aki and his two
sons joined Egil’s group. Late that summer, they sailed to Denmark where
they lay in wait for merchant ships and plundered whenever they
could.</p>
<ol start="47" type="1">
<li>At this time, Harald Gormsson had succeeded to the throne of Denmark
after the death of his father Gorm. The country was in turmoil, with
many Vikings lying off the coast. Aki knew a lot about Denmark; he was
familiar with both the land and the seas around it. So Egil often asked
him about the best places to plunder. When they entered Eyrarsund, Aki
told him that there was a large market town called Lund in the vicinity.
There was a good chance of finding plunder there, though the townspeople
would probably resist. The men were asked if they wanted to go ashore.
Opinion was divided. Some were all for it, while others were against the
idea.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thorolf was eager to go. Then Egil was asked for his opinion, and he
recited a poem:</p>
<p>We warriors—wolf’s prey—</p>
<p>must make swords glitter;</p>
<p>and do daring deeds</p>
<p>in the serpents’ season [summer];</p>
<p>let each of us eagerly</p>
<p>land here in Lund,</p>
<p>and before the setting of the sun</p>
<p>we’ll sing the spear-songs.</p>
<p>After that they got ready to go ashore. They made their way to the
town, and as soon as the townspeople realized what was happening, they
went to meet their attackers. There was a wooden fortification
surrounding the town, and men were sent to defend it. Fighting broke
out, and Egil was first inside the fortification. The townspeople fled
and a great slaughter followed. The attackers sacked and burned the
town. Then they went on their way and returned to their ships.</p>
<ol start="49" type="1">
<li>The following spring, Thorolf and Egil prepared to go on another
Viking trip. When they were ready, they headed east toward the Baltic
and when they reached Vik, they sailed south along the coast of Jutland,
where they did some raiding. Next they made for Friesland and stayed
there for much of the summer. Then they headed toward Denmark, but when
they got to the border between Friesland and Denmark, they anchored off
the coast.</li>
</ol>
<p>One night, two men came to Egil’s ship just as the people aboard were
getting ready to go to sleep. The men said that they had business with
Egil, and when they were brought before him, they told him that Aki the
Rich had sent them with this message:</p>
<p>“Eyvind Skreyja is lying off the coast of Jutland intending to ambush
you when you come north. He has assembled such a large army that you
won’t stand a chance if you have to face the whole force at once; but he
himself is on the move with two light ships, and he’s not far away from
you at the moment.”</p>
<p>When Egil got this news, he ordered his men to take down the awnings
and keep very quiet; they did as he asked. At dawn, they came upon
Eyvind and his force lying at anchor. Egil’s men attacked immediately,
hurling rocks and spears. Many of Eyvind’s men were killed, but Eyvind
himself jumped overboard, and he and the rest of the survivors escaped
by swimming to land.</p>
<p>Egil and his men seized their ships, and took all their clothes and
weapons. Later that day, they returned to their own ships and rejoined
Thorolf. He asked Egil where he had been and where he had got the ships.
Egil said that the ships had belonged to Eyvind Skreyja, but they had
taken them from him. Then he recited the following poem:</p>
<p>When we fought in fierce</p>
<p>combat off Jutland’s coast,</p>
<p>the Viking defender of the Danish</p>
<p>kingdom fought creditably;</p>
<p>until Eyvind leapt overboard,</p>
<p>and, swift to save himself,</p>
<p>swam for the seashore</p>
<p>with his whole host.</p>
<p>Thorolf said, “Given what you’ve done, I don’t think it would be a
good idea for us to go to Norway this autumn.” Egil replied that it
might be just as well to find somewhere else to stay….</p>
<p>Egil in Old Age</p>
<ol start="85" type="1">
<li>Egil Skallagrimsson became an old man. In old age, he grew stiff in
the legs and had difficulty moving. Both his hearing and his sight began
to fail. He was living at this time with Grim and Thordis at Mosfell.
One day, he was walking outside near the wall, when he tripped and
fell.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some women who saw this laughed at him and said, “You’re done for
now, Egil, when you can’t help falling over.”</p>
<p>“Women didn’t laugh at us so much when we were younger,” said
Grim.</p>
<p>Then Egil made up this verse:</p>
<p>My shriveled neck shakes,</p>
<p>I’m forever falling on my hairless head,</p>
<p>my pointless prick is moist and soft,</p>
<p>and I’m hard of hearing.</p>
<p>Egil became completely blind. One cold winter’s day, he went to the
fire to warm himself. The cook complained that it was shameful for a man
of Egil’s reputation to be lying about under their feet, keeping them
from getting their work done.</p>
<p>“Don’t be annoyed if I toast myself by the fire,” said Egil. “There
should be enough room for both of us.”</p>
<p>“Get up,” she said. “Go back to your seat and let us get on with our
work.”</p>
<p>Egil got to his feet and went back to his place. He composed this
poem:</p>
<p>Blind, I must bear</p>
<p>this eye ailment,</p>
<p>blunder to the fire, beg</p>
<p>mercy from a maidservant;</p>
<p>formerly a fierce king</p>
<p>warmed to my words;</p>
<p>the noble lord of lands</p>
<p>gave me gold as reward.</p>
<p>Another time when Egil went to the fire to warm himself, someone
asked him if his feet were cold and warned him not to stretch them too
close to the fire. “Alright,” said Egil, “but it’s hard for me to guide
my feet now that I can’t see. Being blind is a real pain.” Egil composed
this poem:</p>
<p>Life drags,</p>
<p>lying alone is no fun,</p>
<p>a decrepit man</p>
<p>on a down bed;</p>
<p>my feet are frozen</p>
<p>like frigid widows,</p>
<p>ladies chill as ice</p>
<p>lacking passion’s fire.</p>
<p>In the early days of Hakon the Powerful’s reign [Earl Hakon
Sigurdarson, d. 995], Egil Skallagrimsson was in his eighties. He was
still hale and hearty apart from his blindness. One summer, when
everyone was getting ready to go to the Althing, Egil asked Grim if he
could ride along with him. Grim wasn’t too happy about this. When he
talked to Thordis, he told her what Egil had asked.</p>
<p>“I want you to find out what’s behind this,” he said. Thordis went to
talk to her kinsman, Egil. At that time, conversation with Thordis was
Egil’s greatest pleasure. When she met him, she asked,</p>
<p>“Kinsman, is it true that you want to ride to the Althing? I’d like
to know what your plans are.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what I have in mind,” he said. “I’m planning to go to
the Althing and take with me the two chests King Athelstan [king of
England, ca 895–939] gave me. They’re both full of English silver. I
intend to have the two chests carried to the top of the Law Rock when
the place is really crowded and then I’m going to scatter the silver.
I’ll be surprised if people share it out fairly. I expect there will be
shoving and punching. It might even end with the whole crowd at the
Althing getting into a fight.”</p>
<p>“That seems like a great plan,” said Thordis, “and one that will be
remembered as long as Iceland is inhabited.” Then Thordis went to talk
to Grim and told him what Egil intended to do.</p>
<p>“That mustn’t happen,” said Grim. “He can’t go ahead with such a
crazy scheme.” So, when Egil approached Grim about going to the Althing,
Grim opposed the idea completely, and Egil stayed at home during the
Althing. He wasn’t at all pleased and looked rather sullen.</p>
<p>At Mosfell, the animals were kept at a shieling [summer pasture,
usually with a cottage] and that’s where Thordis stayed while the
Althing took place. One evening as the inhabitants of Mosfell were
getting ready for bed, Egil summoned two of Grim’s slaves and ordered
them to fetch him a horse.</p>
<p>“I want to go to the hot springs,” he said. When he was ready, Egil
went out carrying his chests of silver with him. He mounted the horse,
rode over the home field to the slope beyond, and vanished from sight.
When the farm people got up in the morning, they saw Egil wandering
about on the hill to the east of the farm, leading the horse behind him.
They went to him and brought him home, but neither the slaves nor the
chests were ever seen again.</p>
<p>There has been much speculation about where Egil hid his treasure. To
the east of the farm at Mosfell, a gully runs down the mountainside, and
it has been noticed that whenever there is flooding following a sudden
thaw, English pennies have turned up in the gully after the water has
subsided. Some people conclude from this that Egil must have hidden his
treasure there. Below the homestead at Mosfell are large and very deep
bogs. Many people are convinced that Egil must have thrown his treasure
into them. To the south of the river there are hot springs, and close by
the springs there are deep pits in the earth. Some think that this is
where Egil must have hidden his money, for the fire that flickers over
buried treasure is often seen there. Egil admitted that he had killed
Grim’s slaves and also that he had hidden his treasure, but he told no
one where he had hidden it.</p>
<p>Later that autumn Egil fell ill, and the illness carried him off.
When he was dead, Grim had him dressed in fine clothes and moved down to
Tjaldaness where he had a burial mound built. Egil was laid there with
his weapons and clothes.</p>
