<h4 id="viking-activities-in-england-851900-aaaaaaaa">51. Viking
Activities in England, 851–900 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Danish Vikings overwintered on the Isle of Thanet at the mouth of the
River Thames in 850 and again on Sheppey in 854, marking the transition
from seasonal raiding to a more permanent Viking presence in England.
But the real turning point came with the arrival of what is usually
translated as the Great Army (Anglo-Saxon: micel here) in 866, including
as its leaders the sons of Ragnar Hairy-Breeches, Ivar and Halfdan. The
size of the Great Army is hotly debated, as is its precise nature. This
selection ends with the death of King Alfred at the end of the century.
See doc. 39 on the Chronicle.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from David Dumville and Simon Keynes,
general eds., The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1983–), vol. 7; MS E, ed. Susan Irvine
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2004), pp. 46–53.</p>
<p>851 [850/851]. In this year, Alderman Ceorl and the men of Devonshire
fought against heathens and, after huge slaughter, defeated them. The
heathens stayed in Thanet over the winter. The same year, three hundred
and fifty ships arrived at the mouth of the Thames. The heathens stormed
Canterbury and routed Brihtwulf, king of the Mercians, and his army.
Next, the heathens went south across the Thames where King Athelwulf [of
Wessex] and Athelwulf, his son, with the West-Saxon host fought them at
Oakley. This battle was the greatest massacre of a heathen army we have
ever heard tell of. King Athelwulf and his forces were victorious there.
That same year, King Athelstan and Alderman Ealhere fought in their
ships and massacred a large heathen force at Sandwich. They captured
nine ships and drove off the rest.</p>
<p>852 [853]. In this year, Burgred, king of the Mercians, subdued North
Wales with the help of King Athelwulf [of Wessex]. In that year, too,
Ealhere and Huda with the hosts of Kent and Surrey fought a heathen army
at Thanet. Many were killed and drowned on either side. Both aldermen
were among the dead. King Burgred of Mercia married the daughter of
Athelwulf, king of the West Saxons.</p>
<ol start="855" type="1">
<li><p>In this year, heathens spent the winter on Sheppey. In the same
year, King Athelwulf made over a tenth of his property throughout his
kingdom for the glory of God and for his own eternal welfare. That year,
he went to Rome with great honor and stayed there for two years. On his
way back, he married the daughter of Charles, king of France. He arrived
home safely and died about two years later. His body lies in Winchester.
He was the son of Ecgbriht, and ruled for nine years. Then his two sons
took power: Athelbald ruled Wessex and Surrey for five years.</p></li>
<li><p>This year, King Athelbald [of Wessex] died and his body lies at
Sherborne. His brother Athelbriht succeeded to the entire kingdom. In
his days, a large fleet arrived and ravaged Winchester. Alderman Osric
with the Hampshire host, and Alderman Athelwulf with the force from
Berkshire took on the army and put it to flight; they were left in
possession of the battlefield. Athelbriht reigned for five years and his
body rests at Sherborne.</p></li>
<li><p>In this year, the heathen army occupied Thanet and made peace
with the people of Kent. The Kentishmen promised money in return for
peace. Taking advantage of the promise of money, the heathen army stole
up by night and raided the whole of east Kent.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>866 [probably 865]. In this year, Athelred, Athelbriht’s brother,
took over the rule of the West Saxons. That year, too, a great heathen
army invaded the land of the Angles and established winter quarters and
procured horses there. They made peace with the East Anglians.</p>
<p>867 [866]. This year, the heathen army advanced from East Anglia
across the mouth of the River Humber as far as York in Northumbria. The
Northumbrians were seriously at odds with one another. They had recently
overthrown their king, Osbriht, and had accepted as king, Ella, a man
with no claim to the throne. However, late in the year they submitted
again to Osbriht and then fought against the heathen army. They gathered
an immense host and attacked the heathens at York. They penetrated the
fortifications and some of them got inside. There was a huge slaughter
among the Northumbrians, some inside the city and others outside. Both
Northumbrian kings were killed. The survivors made peace with the
heathen army. The same year, Bishop Ealhstan died after holding the
bishopric of Sherborne for fifty years. He is buried in the town.</p>
<p>868 [867]. In this year, the heathen army moved to Nottingham in
Mercia and took up winter quarters there. King Burgred of Mercia and his
council begged King Athelred of Wessex and his brother Alfred to help
them in their fight against the great army. They led the West Saxon host
into Mercia as far as Nottingham where they encountered the heathen army
at the fortifications and laid siege to the city. However, there was no
serious fighting, so the Mercians made peace with the army.</p>
<ol start="869" type="1">
<li>In this year, the heathen army returned to York and stayed there for
a year.</li>
</ol>
<p>870 [869]. In the course of this year, the Danish army crossed Mercia
on its way to East Anglia where they took up winter quarters at
Thetford. The king of East Anglia, Saint Edmund, fought them, but the
Danes won the battle and killed the king. They overran the whole land
and destroyed all the monasteries they came to. At that time, they
stormed and burned Medeshamstede, where they killed the abbot and the
monks. They destroyed everything they found there and reduced to nothing
a place that had formerly been very prosperous. Archbishop Ceolwulf died
this year.</p>
<p>871 [870]. In this year, the heathen army rode to Reading in Wessex.
Three days later, two earls arrived. Alderman Athelwulf encountered them
at Englefield where he fought and beat them. One of the Earls, Sidrac by
name, was killed there. Four days later, King Athelred and his brother
Alfred arrived at Reading, leading a large host. They fought with the
heathen army and there was great carnage on both sides. Alderman
Athelwulf was killed and the Danes remained in possession of the
battlefield.</p>
<p>Four days later, King Athelred and his brother Alfred fought against
the entire army at Ashdown. The Danish army was drawn up in two
divisions, in one of which were Basecg and Halfdan, the heathen kings,
while the two earls were in the other. King Athelred fought against the
division of the two kings and King Basecg was killed. Alfred took on the
earls’ division. Earl Sidrac the Elder and Sidrac the Younger were both
killed there, as were the earls Osbjearn, Fræna, and Harold. Both
divisions of the army were put to flight and many thousands were slain.
Fighting continued until nightfall.</p>
<p>A fortnight later, King Athelred and his brother Alfred fought the
heathen army at Basing, where the Danes won. Two months after this, King
Athelred and his brother Alfred fought the heathen army at Marden [?].
The armies were arranged in two divisions, and each side drove back the
other, and both had successes for a long time during the day; there was
much slaughter on both sides, but the Danes were left in possession of
the battlefield. Bishop Hæhmund was killed along with many good men.
After this battle, the men from a large Danish summer-fleet came to
Reading.</p>
<p>After Easter, King Athelred died after a reign of five years; his
body rests in Wimborne Minster. Then his brother, Alfred son of
Athelwulf, ruled Wessex. A month later, King Alfred, with a small force,
met the whole Danish army in battle at Wilton, and he had them on the
run for much of the day, but the Danes remained in possession of the
battlefield. During this year, nine major battles were fought against
the Danish army in the kingdom to the south of the Thames, not to
mention minor raids carried out by Alfred, aldermen, or king’s thanes
which were not regarded as important. Nine earls and a king were killed
in this year. Also, the West Saxons made peace with the Danish army in
the same year.</p>
<p>872 [871]. This year, the Danish army moved from Reading to London,
where they established winter quarters. The Mercians made peace with the
army in the same year.</p>
<p>873 [872]. [This year, the Danish army went to Northumbria and] set
up winter quarters in Torksey.</p>
<p>874 [873]. This year saw the army move from Lindsey to Repton, where
they stayed for the winter. And they drove King Burgred [of Mercia]
overseas after he had ruled for twenty-two years. They overran the
country, while Burgred went to Rome and lived there. His body lies in
the church of Saint Mary in the English College. The same year, the
Danes gave the throne of Mercia to a foolish king’s thane called
Ceolwulf. He gave them hostages and swore oaths that the kingdom would
be theirs whenever they wished. He swore, too, that he and all who
followed him would be ready to meet the army’s needs.</p>
<p>875 [874]. This year, the army moved from Repton. Halfdan led part of
the army to Northumbria and settled for the winter beside the River
Tyne. The army overran that district and often carried out raids on the
Picts and the Welsh of Strathclyde. The three Danish kings, Guthrum,
Oscytel, and Anwend, left Repton for Cambridge, which they occupied for
a year with a large army. That summer, King Alfred went to sea with a
fleet and fought against seven Danish ships, capturing one and putting
the rest to flight.</p>
<p>876 [875]. In this year, the Danish army stole into Wareham, a fort
belonging to the West Saxons. Later, the king made peace with the army.
They gave King Alfred as hostages the finest men in the army, and swore
oaths on their holy ring—something they had never before done for any
people—that they would leave his kingdom immediately. Taking advantage
of this, their cavalry left the fort surreptitiously and entered Exeter.
That year, Halfdan divided up the land of Northumbria; the raiders
became tillers of the land as well. Rollo and his men invaded Normandy
and he ruled for fifty-three years.</p>
<p>877 [876]. In this year, the Danish army arrived at Exeter from
Wareham. Their fleet sailed round the west coast and ran into a powerful
storm at sea. They lost 120 ships at Swanage. King Alfred pursued the
cavalry with his forces as far as Exeter but could not overtake them
before they reached the fort where no one could get at them. They gave
King Alfred as many prominent hostages as he wanted and swore many oaths
to keep the peace. The army moved into Mercia at harvest time; they took
some of the produce and gave some to Ceolwulf.</p>
<ol start="878" type="1">
<li>In this year, the Danish army moved surreptitiously to Chippenham in
the middle of winter, after twelfth night. They reached Wessex and
occupied it. They drove many of the people overseas, but subdued most of
them, except for King Alfred and a small body of men, who were, despite
hardships, keeping to the forests and areas protected by marshes. The
same winter, the brother of Ivar and Halfdan entered Wessex and
Devonshire where he and 840 men were killed. This year the
battle-standard called the Raven was captured. At Easter, King Alfred,
with his small force, built a fort at Athelney from which he attacked
the Danish army with support from the part of Somerset which is closest.
In the seventh week after Easter, King Alfred rode to Ecgbrihtesstone
[?] to the east of Wealwudu [Selwood?] and he was met there by all the
people of Somerset, Wiltshire, and the part of Hampshire on this side of
the sea; they were all happy to see him. He traveled for one night to
Æglea [Hey?] and one more night to Eddington where he fought with the
whole army and put them to flight. Then King Alfred rode after them as
far as the fort and stayed there for a fortnight. Then the Danish army
gave hostages and swore many oaths that they would leave his kingdom.
They promised that their king would accept baptism; they kept that
promise. Three weeks later, [Danish] King Guthrum arrived at Aller [?]
near Athelney with thirty of the noblest men in the army. At that time,
the king received baptism; his chrysmal [baptismal] robe was removed at
Wedmore. Guthrum stayed with King Alfred for twelve days, and King
Alfred honored Guthrum’s companions with rich gifts.</li>
</ol>
<p>879 [878]. This year the army moved from Chippenham to Cirencester
and remained there for the winter. That year, a band of Vikings gathered
and occupied Fulham beside the Thames. That same year the sun went dark
for an hour.</p>
<p>880 [879]. In this year, the Danish army moved from Cirencester to
East Anglia which they occupied and divided up. In the same year, the
army occupying Fulham crossed the sea to Ghent in the land of the Franks
and stayed there for a year.</p>
<ol start="881" type="1">
<li>This year, the Danish army moved deeper into the land of the Franks,
and the Franks fought them. After the battle, the Danish army acquired
horses.</li>
</ol>
<p>882 [881]. This year, the Danish army traveled up the River Maas in
the land of the Franks and stayed there for a year. That same year, King
Alfred took a fleet to sea and fought four Danish ships. He captured two
and killed their crews. The other ships surrendered to him, but not
before their men were badly knocked about and wounded.</p>
<p>883 [882]. In this year, the Danish army traveled up the Scheldt to
Condé and stayed there for a year. Also, Pope Marinus sent a fragment of
the true cross to King Alfred. In the same year, Sighelm and Athelstan
took to Rome the alms that had been promised by King Alfred. They also
took alms for Saint Thomas and Saint Bartholemew in India. At that time,
King Alfred besieged the Danish army at London, and there, God be
thanked, their prayers were largely fulfilled after they had made their
vows.</p>
<p>884 [883]. This year, the army went up the Somme to Amiens and stayed
there for a year.</p>
<p>885 [884]. This year, the Danish army, mentioned above, divided into
two parts. One part went east while the other went to Rochester and laid
siege to it. The Danes built defensive works for themselves, but the
defenders of the castle held out until King Alfred came up with the
host. Then the Danes took to their ships, abandoning their defensive
works. They were also deprived of their horses there, and soon after
went overseas.</p>
<p>That same year, King Alfred sent a fleet from Kent to East Anglia. As
soon as they entered the mouth of the Stour, they encountered sixteen
Viking ships which they fought and captured, killing the crews.
Traveling home with their spoils, they met a large Viking fleet. They
fought the same day and the Danes won.</p>
<p>At midwinter, Charles [Carloman II], king of the Franks, died, killed
by a wild boar. The year before, his brother [Louis III] had died. He,
too, had ruled the western kingdom and died in the year of the eclipse.
He was son of the Charles whose daughter King Athelwulf of Wessex
married [Carloman II was the son of Louis II; Charles the Bald was
actually his grandfather].</p>
<p>That year, the good Pope Marinus died. He had given liberty to the
English College at the request of Alfred, king of Wessex. The pope sent
King Alfred the splendid gift of a fragment of the cross on which Christ
suffered. That same year, the Danish army advanced on East Anglia and
broke the peace treaty with King Alfred.</p>
<p>886 [885]. This year, the Danish army which had earlier gone east in
the land of the Franks came back west along the River Seine and took
winter quarters in the city of Paris. That same year, King Alfred
occupied London and the entire English people came to him, except for
those who were in the power of the Danes. Then he entrusted the city to
the care of Athelred the alderman.</p>
<p>887 [886–87]. This year, the Danish army crossed the bridge at Paris
and followed the Seine as far as the Marne. Then they went along the
Marne to Chézy and the Yonne, and occupied both positions for two
winters…. In the same year as the army crossed the bridge at Paris,
Athelhelm the alderman took the alms of the West Saxons and of King
Alfred to Rome.</p>
<ol start="888" type="1">
<li><p>In this year Beocca the alderman took the alms of the West Saxons
and of King Alfred to Rome. Also, Queen Athelswith, King Alfred’s
sister, died and her body lies in Pavia…. In the same year, Archbishop
Athelred and Alderman Athewold died in the same month.</p></li>
<li><p>In this year, no one traveled to Rome except two couriers who
were sent with letters by King Alfred.</p></li>
<li><p>In this year, Abbot Beornhelm of Wessex took the alms of Wessex
and King Alfred to Rome. Guthrum, king of the Northmen, died. His
baptismal name was Athelstan and he was King Alfred’s godson. He lived
in East Anglia where he had first settled. That year, the Danish army on
the Seine moved to Saint-Lô, which is situated between the Bretons and
the Franks. The Bretons fought them and won. The Danes were driven into
a river, where many of them drowned. At this time, Plegmund was chosen
as archbishop by the pope and the whole people.</p></li>
<li><p>This year, the army which we have already spoken about moved back
westwards to Boulogne where they boarded ships and crossed all at once
with their horses and equipment. They arrived at the mouth of the Limne
in 250 ships. The mouth of the Limne is in the east of Kent, at the
eastern end of the great forest we call Anderida. This forest runs from
east to west 112 miles or longer and is thirty miles broad. The river we
are speaking about flows from the Weald. They towed their ships up this
river as far as the Weald, four miles from the estuary of the river.
There, in a fen, they destroyed a hastily built fort with a few common
men in it. Soon after this, Hastein sailed into the mouth of the Thames
with eighty ships. He built a fortification at Middletown and the other
army did the same at Appledore. This year, Wulfhere, archbishop of
Northumbria, died.</p></li>

<p>What follows is taken from MS A of the Chronicle.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from David Dumville and Simon Keynes,
general eds., The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1983–), vol. 3; MS A, ed. Janet Bately
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1986), pp. 59–61.</p>
<ol start="896" type="1">
<li>Then King Alfred ordered the building of longships to oppose the
Danish ships. Some had sixty oars and others more. The new ships were
nearly twice as long as the others as well as being faster, steadier in
the water, and higher. These ships were modeled neither on Frisian nor
Danish lines, but according to what seemed most useful to King
Alfred.</li>
</ol>
<p>Later in the same year, six Danish ships came to the Isle of Wight
and did a lot of damage in the area, in Devon and nearly everywhere else
on the seacoast. Then King Alfred ordered out nine of the new ships.
They closed off the river mouth, denying the Danes access to the open
sea. Then the Danes sailed out against them with three ships, while the
other three were beached further up the river mouth because their crews
had gone ashore. Two Danish ships were captured and their crews killed
at the outer part of the river mouth. The third ship escaped with only
five of its crew still alive. This ship escaped because the English
ships had gone aground in an awkward position; three had gone aground on
the same side of the channel as the Danish ships. The rest were on the
other side so that none of them could reach the others, for the tide had
ebbed many furlongs from the ships. Then the Danes from the three
beached ships approached the three English ships which had been grounded
on their side of the river. They fought. Lucumon, the king’s reeve was
killed, and so were Wulfheard the Frisian, Ebbe the Frisian, Athelhere
the Frisian, and Athelferth the king’s herdsman. Sixty-two of the
English and Frisians died and a hundred and twenty of the Danes.</p>
<p>However, the flood tide reached the Danish ships before the
Christians could shove out their own. So the Danes rowed away, but they
were so badly wounded that they could not row beyond the Sussex coast.
Two of their ships were driven ashore there. The crews were taken to the
king in Winchester, and he hanged them. The remaining Danish ship made
it to East Anglia with its badly wounded crew. That summer, no fewer
than twenty ships and their crews were lost along the south coast….</p>
<p>900 [899]. In this year, Alfred Athulfing [son of Athelwulf] died six
days before All Saints’ Day. He was king over all England except for the
