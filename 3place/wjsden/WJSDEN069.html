<h4 id="the-martyrdom-of-blathmac-825-aaaaaaaa">43. The Martyrdom of
Blathmac, 825 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Walafrid Strabo (d. 849) was a Carolingian court scholar and abbot of
the monastery of Reichenau. One of his works was a Latin poem on the
martyrdom of the Irish warrior-aristocrat turned monk Blathmac, who
joined the monastic community on Iona in order, it would seem,
deliberately to seek martyrdom at the hands of Scandinavian raiders.</p>
<p>Source: ed. and trans. A.O. Anderson, Early Sources of Scottish
History A.D. 500 to 1286, 2 vols. (Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd, 1922;
reprinted Stamford: Paul Watkins, 1990), vol. 1, pp. 263–65.</p>
<p>A certain island appears in the shores of the Picts, rising above the
wave-driven sea; it is called Iona, and there the saint of the Lord,
Columba, rests in the flesh. To this island came Blathmac, wishing to
endure Christ’s scars, because there many a pagan horde of Danes is wont
to land, armed with malignant greed. And the saint of the Lord purposed
in his mind [decided] to tempt these lions, and stripped his mind of
empty dread; but armed with the shield of faith, and the helmet of
salvation, he feared not the arms of wicked men. He might have sung with
the wisdom-speaking prophet, “I have God as my helper, let base fear
depart.” Already too by wars of states he had been taught to despise the
servants of the devil, since he had fitly overthrown their lord, and
alone defeated him in all his weapons.</p>
<p>The time arrived, when God’s great clemency disposed to associate his
servant with the shining bands above the stars, and to bestow upon the
good conqueror his certain crown: when the holy man’s mind, foreknowing
events, learned in advance by exalted sense that the approaching wolves
were hastening to divide the members of the pious sheep. He said, “You,
my friends, search within yourselves with active minds whether you have
courage to endure suffering with me for the name of Christ; you who are
able to await it, I ask to arm your manly minds; but those whose frail
hearts are afraid, let them hasten their flight, to avoid the impending
danger, and arm their hands in a better cause; close to us stands the
experience of certain death. Let strong faith be watchful, supported by
hope in the future; let the prudent precaution of flight save the
weaker.”</p>
<p>Upon these words the company was stirred, and in this mood they
decided upon what they saw was possible; some, with courageous breast,
to face the sacrilegious hands; and they rejoiced with tranquil minds to
have submitted their heads to the violent sword: but others, not yet
induced to this by their confidence of mind, took to flight by a
footpath through regions known to them.</p>
<p>Golden dawn shone forth, parting the dewy dusk, and the brilliant sun
glittered with beautiful orb, when this holy teacher, celebrating the
holy service of mass, stood before the sacred altar as a calf without
blemish, a pleasing offering to God, to be sacrificed by a threatening
sword. The others of the company were prostrate, commending to the
Thunderer [God] with tears and prayers their souls, about to depart from
the burden of the flesh. See, the violent cursed host came rushing
through the open buildings, threatening cruel perils to the blessed men;
and after slaying with mad savagery the rest of the associates, they
approached the holy father, to compel him to give up the precious metals
wherein lie the holy bones of St Columba; but [the monks] had lifted the
shrine from its pediments, and had placed it in the earth, in a hollowed
barrow, under a thick layer of turf; because they knew then of the
wicked destruction [to come]. This booty the Danes desired; but the
saint remained with unarmed hand, and with unshaken purpose of mind; [he
had been] trained to stand against the foe, and to arouse the fight, and
[was] unused to yield[ing].</p>
<p>There he spoke to thee, barbarian, in words such as these: “I know
nothing at all of the gold you seek, where it is concealed in the ground
or in what hiding place it is concealed. And if by Christ’s permission
it were granted me to know it, never would our lips relate it to thy
ears. Barbarian, draw thy sword, grasp the hilt, and slay; gracious God,
to thy aid I commend me humbly.”</p>
<p>Therefore the pious sacrifice was torn limb from limb. And what the
fierce soldier could not purchase by gifts, he began to seek by wounds
in the cold bowels [of the earth]. It is not strange, for there always
were, and there always reappear, those that are spurred on by evil rage
against all the servants of the Lord; so that what Christ’s decision has
appointed for all, this they all do for Christ, although with unequal
deeds.</p>
<p>Thus [Blathmac] became a martyr for Christ’s name; and, as rumor
bears witness, he rests in the same place, and there many miracles are
given for his holy merits. There the Lord is worshipped reverently with
fitting honor, with the saints by whose merits I believe my faults are
washed away, and to whom as a suppliant I have sent up gifts of praise.
Christ refuses nothing to these—they have brought him the greatest
gains—and he reigns forever with the good Father and the Holy Spirit,
and is exalted without end in everlasting splendor.</p>
