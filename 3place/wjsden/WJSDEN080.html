Earl Sigurd and the Establishment of the Earldom of Orkney AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Scandinavian settlement in Orkney and Shetland is undocumented in
contemporary sources. It is thought that settlement began in the ninth
century, after the initial raiding of the late eighth century, though
the suggestion has been made that Shetland and Orkney may have been
settled earlier and used as bases for the late-eighth-century raids.
Orkneyinga saga, composed around 1200 in Iceland, is the main written
source for Viking Age Orkney, but its historical value for the
settlement period is limited and it has little to say about how the
islands were initially settled by Scandinavians. The saga’s early
chapters contain an account of the establishment of the earldom, but
modern scholarship is highly skeptical about King Harald Finehair’s
expedition. The dating of these events is uncertain; Earl Sigurd
probably died ca 892.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Orkneyinga saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit XXXIV (Reykjavík,
1965), pp. 7–9.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>When King Harald Finehair seized Norway, Earl Rognvald was with him,
and the king gave him control of North Møre, South Møre, and Raumsdal.
Earl Rognvald married Ragnhild, the daughter of Hrolf the Nose, and
their son Hrolf conquered Normandy. He was so large that no horse could
carry him and, for that reason, he became known as Gongu-Hrolf [Hrolf
the Walker]. The earls of Rouen and the kings of England are descended
from him. Rognvald and Ragnhild had two other sons whose names were Ivar
and Thorir the Silent. Rognvald also had three illegitimate sons called
Hallad, Hrollaug, and Einar, who was the youngest.</li>
</ol>
<p>One summer, Harald Finehair sailed west on a punitive expedition
against some Vikings, for he was growing tired of the lawless behavior
of these men who were raiding in Norway over the summers and spending
the winters in the Orkneys and Shetlands. Harald brought the Shetlands,
the Orkneys, and the Hebrides under his control, and then he sailed west
as far as the Isle of Man where he laid waste the settlements. He fought
many battles there and took possession of lands further west than any
Norwegian king has done since. In one of these battles, Earl Rognvald’s
son Ivar was killed. So when King Harald sailed east again, he gave Earl
Rognvald the Orkneys and Shetlands as compensation for the loss of his
son. Rognvald gave both territories to his brother, Sigurd, who was the
forecastle-man on King Harald’s ship. And when the king left for Norway,
he gave Sigurd the title of earl, and Sigurd stayed behind in the
west.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Earl Sigurd became a great chieftain. He formed an alliance with
Thorstein the Red, the son of Olaf the White and Unn the Deep-Minded,
and together they conquered the whole of Caithness as well as
Sutherland, Moray, and Ross. He built a fortress in the south of
Moray.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sigurd and Maelbricht Tooth, earl of the Scots, agreed to hold a
meeting at an appointed place to settle their differences. Each of them
was to bring forty men. But on the day of the meeting, Sigurd reflected
that the Scots were not to be trusted, so he mounted eighty men on forty
horses. When Maelbricht noticed this, he said to his men:</p>
<p>“Sigurd has tricked us. I can see the feet of two men on the flanks
of every horse, so there must be twice as many men as horses. Let us
muster our courage, so that each of us may kill a man before dying
ourselves.” Then they prepared for battle.</p>
<p>But Sigurd saw what the Scots were up to and said to his men, “When
the fighting starts, half of us will dismount and outflank the Scots
from the left. Meanwhile the rest of us will ride at them as hard as
possible and break up their formation.”</p>
<p>And that’s what they did; there was some fierce fighting and before
long Maelbricht and his men were slain. Sigurd had their heads hung from
his horses’ cruppers as a sign of his triumph. Then they rode home,
boasting of their victory. But on the way, as Sigurd was attempting to
spur on his horse, he struck his calf against Maelbricht’s protruding
tooth and scratched himself. The wound grew swollen and painful, and
that’s what caused his death. Sigurd the Powerful is buried in a mound
beside the River Oykel….</p>
