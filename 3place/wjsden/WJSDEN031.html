<h4 id="the-prowess-of-freydis-daughter-of-eirik-the-red">22. The
Prowess of Freydis, Daughter of Eirik the Red</h4>
<p>Eirik’s ruthless and adventurous spirit reappears in his daughter,
Freydis, who becomes joint leader of an expedition to Vinland the Good
(in North America) around the year 1000. She displays a deviousness and
cruelty to equal the major male players in the sagas—Egil
Skallagrimsson, for instance. This passage comes from The Saga of the
Greenlanders (see docs. 77 and 78).</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Groenlendinga saga, in Eyrbyggja
saga, ed. Einar Ól. Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit IV
(Reykjavík, 1935), pp. 264–68.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Once again there was talk of a voyage to Vinland, for such a trip
seemed a great way to gain both riches and reputation. In the same
summer as Karlsefni came back from Vinland, a ship arrived in Greenland
from Norway. The skippers were two brothers, Helgi and Finnbogi,
Icelanders by birth, from the Eastfjords. They wintered over in
Greenland.</li>
</ol>
<p>The story goes on to say that Freydis Eiriksdaughter traveled from
her home in Gardar and went to meet the brothers Helgi and Finnbogi. She
asked them if they would accompany her to Vinland with their ship and
share equally with her all the profits they made there. They agreed to
this. Next, Freydis went to see her brother Leif and asked him to give
her the houses he had built in Vinland. Leif replied as before that he
would lend the houses, but not give them.</p>
<p>Freydis and the brothers agreed that each ship should carry thirty
men who were capable of fighting, as well as some women. Immediately,
Freydis broke the agreement by bringing along five extra men whom she
hid. The brothers had no idea of this until they reached Vinland.</p>
<p>So they put to sea after agreeing beforehand to sail in convoy if
possible. However, though they kept close, the brothers arrived a little
earlier and had carried their cargo up to Leif’s houses before Freydis
landed. Her men unloaded her ship and carried the freight up to the
houses.</p>
<p>“Why did you put your things in here?” Freydis asked. “Because we
thought that you would honor the whole of our agreement,” they
replied.</p>
<p>“Leif lent the houses to me, not you,” she said. “We brothers will
never come close to you in nastiness,” Helgi replied.</p>
<p>They carried the cargo outside and built themselves a house on a
lakeside further inland. They made themselves comfortable there.
Freydis, in the meantime, had a shipload of timber felled.</p>
<p>Now winter set in and the brothers suggested that they should hold
games and have some entertainments. These amusements continued for a
while until relations became strained and the two parties fell out. The
games ceased and there was no more coming and going between the houses;
this situation lasted for much of the winter.</p>
<p>Early one morning, Freydis got out of bed and put on her clothes
except for her shoes. Outside, a heavy dew had fallen. She dressed in
her husband’s cloak and went to the door of the brothers’ house. Someone
had just gone out and left the door half-open. She opened it fully and
stood in the entry for a time without saying anything. Finnbogi was
lying at the far end of the hall. He was awake and said, “What do you
want here, Freydis?”</p>
<p>She replied, “I want you to get up and come outside with me because
I’d like to have a talk with you.” He did as she asked and they walked
to a tree trunk lying near the wall of the house and sat down. “How are
things going?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I like the land well enough,” he answered, “but I don’t like the
hostility between us. In my opinion, it has arisen out of nothing.”</p>
<p>“Very true,” she said. “That’s my opinion too. But my reason for
coming to see you is that I want to swap ships with you and your
brother, since yours is bigger than mine, and I want to leave here.”
“That will be fine with me if it’s fine by you,” he said.</p>
<p>On this note, they parted. Finnbogi went back to bed and Freydis went
home. When she climbed into bed, her feet were so cold that Thorvard
woke up and asked why she was so cold and wet. She answered angrily, “I
went to ask the brothers if I could buy their ship as I wanted a bigger
one and this made them so angry that they beat me and treated me
abusively. But you, you miserable creature, won’t avenge either my shame
or your own. Now I know for sure that I’m not in Greenland and if you
won’t avenge this, I’ll divorce you.”</p>
<p>Unable to put up with her abuse, Thorvald ordered his men to get up
right away and fetch their weapons. They did so and went straight to the
brothers’ house, bursting in on them while they were still asleep. They
seized them, tied them up, and brought them out one by one. Freydis had
each one killed as he came out. Soon all the men were dead and only the
women were left. No one wanted to kill them. Then Freydis said, “Hand me
an ax.”</p>
<p>This was done. She attacked all five women and left them dead. After
this terrible deed, they returned to their own house, and it was only
too clear that Freydis thought she had acted very cleverly.</p>
<p>“If we ever get back to Greenland,” she said to her companions, “I’ll
kill anyone who talks about what has happened. Our story must be that
they stayed behind here when we left.”</p>
<p>Early in the spring, they loaded up the brothers’ ship with as large
a cargo as they could get together and the ship could hold. Then they
put to sea. They had a good voyage and sailed into Eiriksfjord early in
the summer….</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Freydis returned to her farm which had survived her absence without
harm. She heaped rewards on her entire crew since she wanted her crimes
kept secret. After that, she remained on her farm. However, not everyone
was close-mouthed enough to keep silent about her wicked behavior and
stop it from getting out. After a while, her brother Leif heard the
story. He thought it was dreadful. Leif captured three of Freydis’s men
and tortured them until they confessed what had happened; their stories
confirmed one another.</li>
</ol>
<p>“I can’t bring myself to deal with my sister Freydis as she
deserves,” said Leif, “but I prophesy that their descendants will never
thrive.” And that’s how things turned out: after that, everyone thought
badly of her and her family….</p>
