<h4 id="b-the-rage-of-skallagrim-and-egil">(b) The Rage of Skallagrim
and Egil</h4>
<p>Father and son display a berserk’s rage when they take games too
seriously.</p>
<p>Source: Egils saga Skalla-Grímssonar, ed. Sigurður Nordal, Íslenzk
fornrit II (Reykjavík, 1933), pp. 98–102.</p>
<ol start="40" type="1">
<li>Skallagrim took great delight in trials of strength and sports and
he loved talking about them. Ball-games were played in those days. At
that time there were plenty of strong men, but no one came near
Skallagrim in strength, even when he was advanced in years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Grani of Granistead had a young and very promising son called Thord
who was deeply attached to Egil Skallagrimson. Egil was a great one for
wrestling as well as being extremely headstrong and hot-tempered.
Everyone knew to warn their sons not to win against Egil.</p>
<p>At the beginning of winter, a large number of people held a ball-game
at Hvitarvellir; they came from all over the district, including many
from Skallagrim’s household. Thord Granison was the most eager amongst
them. Egil asked Thord if he could go with him to the game; he was seven
years old then. Thord agreed and carried Egil on his back.</p>
<p>When they arrived, the men were divided up for the game. Lots of boys
had come as well. They set up another game, and they formed groups for
that too. Egil drew as his opponent a boy called Grim, son of Hegg from
Heggstead. Grim was eleven or twelve years old, and strong for his age.
When they played, Egil proved the weaker and Grim put all that he had
into the effort. Egil lost his temper, raised the bat, and struck him
with it. Grim seized him and gave him a really bad fall; he said that he
would hurt Egil seriously if he didn’t behave himself.</p>
<p>When Egil got to his feet, he left the game, and the boys laughed at
him. Egil went looking for Thord Granison and told him what had
happened. Thord said, “I’ll go with you and we’ll get our own back on
him.” Thord handed him a skeggax [one-handed ax] which he had with him.
They walked to where the boys were playing. Grim had the ball and was
running off with it; the other boys were in pursuit. Egil leapt at Grim
and drove the ax into his head so that it penetrated the brain. Egil and
Thord immediately returned to their people. The men from Myrar seized
their weapons; indeed, both sides did so. Oleif Hjalti ran with his
followers to join the men of Borg, so that they were much the larger
group; then the two sides separated.</p>
<p>This caused bad blood between Oleif and Hegg and they fought at
Laxfit near Grimsa [Grim’s River]. Six men died there; Hegg was mortally
wounded and his brother, Kvig, died too.</p>
<p>When Egil came home, Skallagrim paid little heed, but Bera said that
he was likely to become a great Viking and that a warship would be in
store for him when he was old enough. Egil recited a poem:</p>
<p>She would buy me, said my mother,</p>
<p>a fast ship with splendid oars;</p>
<p>I would travel away with Vikings,</p>
<p>stand watch at the prow,</p>
<p>steer my fine ship;</p>
<p>I would make for harbor,</p>
<p>cut down one man and another.</p>
<p>At the age of twelve, Egil was so well-developed that few grown men,
however big and strong, could beat him at games. In the winter he turned
twelve, Egil competed frequently in games; he and Thord Granason, a
strong twenty year old, were often pitted against Skallagrim. On one
occasion late in the winter, a ball game [Knattleikr] was held at
Sandvik, south of Borg. Egil and Thord were playing against Skallagrim
and the game was going in their favor because Skallagrim was tiring.
However, in the evening, the going got tougher for Egil and Thord since,
after sunset, Skallagrim became stronger. He grew so strong that he was
able to pick Thord up and throw him to the ground so hard that every
bone in his body was broken and he died instantly. Then Skallagrim
seized Egil.</p>
<p>One of Skallagrim’s slave-women, Thorgerd Brak, had nursed Egil in
his childhood. She was a big woman, as strong as a man, and very skilled
in magic.</p>
<p>“Skallagrim,” she said, “you’re raging like a berserk against your
own son.” Skallagrim let Egil go and grabbed at her, but she broke away
and took to her heels with Skallagrim right behind her. They ran to the
very tip of Digraness where she leapt from the cliff into the sea.
Skallagrim pitched a huge rock at her. The rock struck her between the
shoulder-blades and neither she nor the rock ever resurfaced. The place
is now called Brak’s Sound.</p>
<p>When they got back to Borg later that evening, Egil was in a rage
and, when Skallagrim and the others sat down at the dinner-table, he
didn’t take his place. Then he strode into the room and went straight up
to the man who managed Skallagrim’s workers and estate; this man was
very dear to Skallagrim. Egil killed him with a blow and then went to
his seat. Skallagrim said nothing and the matter rested there. But
afterwards Egil and Skallagrim had not a word, either good or bad, to
say to one another, and this state of affairs lasted all winter.</p>
