<h4 id="a-the-book-of-the-icelanders-aaaaaaaa">(a) The Book of the
Icelanders AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The Book of the Icelanders [Íslendingabók] is a concise, vernacular
outline of historical events in Iceland from its settlement in the 870s
to the early twelfth century. It was the work of Ari Fróði (the Wise)
Thorgilsson (1068–1148), who compiled it between about 1122 and 1133.
Little is known of Ari, but he was well educated, and Snorri Sturluson
tells us that he was the first Icelander to write Icelandic history in
the vernacular. Ari drew on reliable native informants who could
remember events stretching back to about the year 1000. He provides
precise dates for key events, thereby laying the foundation of early
Icelandic chronology. Despite its brevity, Íslendingabók is one of the
most important sources for the settlement of Iceland and subsequent
historical developments, including the conversion to Christianity.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Íslendingabók, ed. Jakob
Benediktsson, Íslenzk fornrit I (Reykjavík, 1986), pp. 4–7.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Iceland was first settled from Norway in the days of King Harald
Finehair, the son of Halfdan the Black. According to the reckoning of
the wisest man I know—my foster-father Teit, son of Bishop Isleif—and of
my uncle, Thorkel Gellisson, who remembered a long way back, and of
Thurid, daughter of Snorri the Priest, who was both wise and
well-informed, the settlement of Iceland took place at the time when
Ivarr, the son of Ragnar Hairy-Breeches, had Saint Edmund, king of the
English, killed. And according to Saint Edmund’s saga, that happened 870
years after the birth of Christ.</li>
</ol>
<p>The story goes—and it is a true one—that a Norwegian, called Ingolf,
traveled from Norway to Iceland for the first time when Harald Finehair
was sixteen years old and, again, a few years later. He settled to the
south, in Reykjavik. The place where he landed first is called Ingolf’s
Head, to the east of Minthak’s Shoal, and the place where he later
settled is Ingolfsfell, which lies to the east of the Olfoss river.</p>
<p>In those days, there were trees growing in Iceland between the
mountains and the shore. There were also Christian men here, whom the
Norsemen called papar, but they left afterwards because they did not
want to live alongside heathens. They left behind some Irish books,
bells, and croziers, from which it may be deduced that they were
Irishmen.</p>
<p>After that, a great number of people began to migrate here from
Norway until King Harald banned the practice, fearing that his land
would be depopulated otherwise. Then it was agreed that anyone coming
here from Norway would have to pay the king five pieces of gold, unless
he was granted an exemption. King Harald is said to have been king for
seventy years and to have reached the age of eighty.</p>
<p>This is the origin of the tax called Landaurar [Land money]. The tax
was sometimes higher and sometimes lower until Olaf the Stout [Saint
Olaf, 995–1030] made it definite that anyone traveling between Norway
and Iceland had to pay the king half a mark, except for women and the
men he exempted. Thorkell Gellisson was our source for this.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>…After Iceland had been extensively settled, a Norwegian called
Ulfljot brought the first laws here from Norway. Teit was the one who
gave us an account of this. The laws were called Ulfljot’s Laws…. These
laws were largely based on the Gulathing Law or on the judgment of
Thorleif the Wise, son of Hortha-Kari, when a law needed to be extended
or abolished, or modified in some other way….</li>
</ol>
<p>Ulfljot’s foster-brother was said to be Grim Goat’s Hair. On Ulflot’s
advice, this Grim surveyed the whole of Iceland before the Althing
[general assembly] was established. As payment for this, every man in
the country contributed a penny to him, and afterwards he gave that
money to temples.</p>
