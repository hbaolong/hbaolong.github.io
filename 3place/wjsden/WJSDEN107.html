<h4 id="the-norse-discovery-of-vinland">77. The Norse Discovery of
Vinland</h4>
<p>The so-called Vinland Sagas comprise two separate works, The Saga of
the Greenlanders and Eirik the Red’s Saga, both of which contain
accounts of several voyages undertaken around the year 1000 by
Icelanders and Greenlanders to North America. Both were originally
written down in the thirteenth century, though The Saga of the
Greenlanders is thought to be older than Eirik the Red’s Saga. The sagas
contain two different accounts of these Viking voyages to North America.
The Saga of the Greenlanders relates a total of five successful voyages
and one abortive voyage to Vinland, while Eirik the Red’s Saga recounts
two successful journeys and one abortive attempt. As well as the family
of Eirik the Red, the family of Thorfinn Karlsefni and Gudrid
Thorbjarnardaughter (see doc. 9) are the principal characters involved
in the exploration and exploitation of Vinland. Both sagas mention the
descendants of Thorfinn and Gudrid and are thought to reflect family
tradition.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Groenlendinga saga, in Eyrbyggja
saga, ed. Einar Ól. Sveinsson and Matthías Þórðarson, Íslenzk fornrit IV
(Reykjavík, 1935), pp. 244–54.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Herjolf was the son of Bard Herjolfsson. He was a relative of Ingolf
the Settler from whom Herjolf and his people received land between Vag
and Reykjaness. Herjolf lived first at Drepstokki. His wife was called
Thorgerd and their son was Bjarni, a most promising man. Bjarni traveled
abroad from an early age and he increased both his wealth and his
reputation. He spent alternate winters overseas or with his father. Soon
Bjarni was the owner of a trading ship. During the last year Bjarni
spent in Norway, Herjolf got ready for the journey to Greenland with
Eirik the Red and gave up his farm…. Herjolf settled at Herjolfsness in
Greenland, and was a highly honored man….</li>
</ol>
<p>The same summer, Bjarni arrived with his ship at Eyrar [in Iceland]
when his father had already sailed for Greenland. This news seemed so
momentous to him that he did not want to disembark. His crew asked him
what he would do, and he answered that he intended to stick to what he
usually did, and spend the winter with his father.</p>
<p>“I mean to sail to Greenland, if you’re willing to come with me,” he
said. They all declared that they would fall in with his plans.</p>
<p>“Our journey seems really stupid,” he said, “considering that none of
us has ever sailed in the Greenland Sea.”</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as soon as they were ready, they put out to sea and
sailed for three days until the land fell below the horizon. Then the
favorable wind fell away and shifted to the north. There was a fog, so
that they had no idea of where they were going, and that went on for
many days. After a time, they saw the sun and so were able to orientate
themselves. They hoisted sail and went on that day until they sighted
land. They had a discussion about what land it might be, and Bjarni said
that he thought it wasn’t Greenland. They asked him if he wanted to sail
toward this land or not.</p>
<p>“I think we should sail close to the land,” he said. They did so, and
saw straightaway that the land had no mountains and was forested, with
low hills. So they left the land to port and set the sail with their
sheet turned toward the coast.</p>
<p>They sailed on for two days after that until they saw land for a
second time. Again they asked if Bjarni thought this was Greenland. He
replied that he thought this was no more Greenland than the last place.
“For there are said to be massive glaciers in Greenland,” he said.</p>
<p>They quickly approached this place and saw that it was flat and
wooded. At that point, the favorable wind died away. After some
discussion among themselves the crew announced that it would be a good
idea to go ashore here, but Bjarni refused. The crew thought that they
needed both wood and water.</p>
<p>“You’ve no shortage of either,” said Bjarni and gave his crew the
rough side of his tongue. They obeyed his orders to raise the sail and
turned the prow out to sea, away from land. For three days they sailed
with a southwesterly wind and saw land on the third. This land was high
and had a glacier, so they asked Bjarni if he would let them go ashore
here, but he said no. “I think this land looks unpromising,” he said.
They didn’t lower the sail and followed the coastline only to discover
that it was an island.</p>
<p>Once again they headed out to sea with the same wind behind them. But
the wind blew more and more strongly, so Bjarni ordered the sail to be
reefed and not to be raised so much that either the ship or its rigging
was in danger. They sailed four more days and sighted land on the
fourth. Then the crew asked if he thought this was Greenland or not.</p>
<p>“This place is most like what I’ve been told about Greenland, and
we’ll head for shore here,” said Bjarni. They did so and made land
beside a headland in the evening. There was a ship at the headland.
Herjolf, Bjarni’s father, lived by the headland which took its name from
him and ever since has been called Herjolf’s Ness. Bjarni went to his
father’s house. He gave up sailing and stayed with his father while
Herjolf lived. After his father’s death, he continued living there.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Bjarni Herjolfsson traveled from Greenland to meet Earl Eirik. The
earl made him welcome, and Bjarni told him about his journey and about
the lands he had seen. However, he had no real information about these
places, so people thought he was lacking in curiosity, and he attracted
some criticism for this. Bjarni became one of the earl’s retainers, and
the following summer he returned to Greenland.</li>
</ol>
<p>Everyone was now talking about voyages of exploration. Leif, the son
of Eirik the Red from Brattahlid, went to see Bjarni Herjolfsson and
bought his ship. He assembled a crew of thirty-five and invited his
father to lead the expedition. Eirik was reluctant, saying that he was
getting on in years and could no longer bear the hardships of seafaring
as he had done in the past. Leif answered that his father still brought
better luck than any of his kinsmen, so Eirik gave in. When everything
was ready, he left home on horseback, but a short distance from the
ship, his horse stumbled and he was thrown, injuring his foot.</p>
<p>“I’m not destined to discover any other lands than the one where we
are living now,” said Eirik. “This is as far as we’ll be traveling
together.” Eirik returned to Brattahlid while Leif and his crew of
thirty-five carried on to the ship. One of the crew was a southerner, a
man called Tyrkir.</p>
<p>When their ship was ready, they set sail, and the first land they
came to was the one that Bjarni had discovered last. They made for the
coast and dropped anchor. Then they launched a boat and went ashore.
There was no grass to be seen, only great glaciers stretching inland
with what seemed like a single slab of rock between the glaciers and the
shore; this land didn’t look as if it would be much use. “At least we’ve
come ashore here, which is more than Bjarni did,” said Leif. “Now I’m
going to give the land a name. I’ll call it Helluland [Flat-Rock Land:
Baffin Island?].”</p>
<p>Then they went back to the ship, put to sea, and found a second land.
Once again, they sailed toward it, anchored, launched a boat, and went
ashore. This land sloped gently to the sea; it was flat and
tree-covered, and, wherever they went, there were extensive beaches of
white sand. “I’m going to name this land for its resources,” said Leif,
“and call it Markland [Forest-Land: Labrador?].”</p>
<p>They hurried back to their ship and sailed away with a north-easterly
wind behind them. After two days at sea, they sighted land. They sailed
toward it and came to an island which lay to the north of the land
itself. The weather was fine and they went ashore. Looking about them,
they noticed that there was dew on the grass. The first thing they did
was to collect the dew on their hands and put it in their mouths; they
thought that they had never tasted anything so sweet. Then they returned
to their ship and sailed into the sound which separated the island from
a headland that stretched north from the mainland. They steered west
around the headland, but the water there was very shallow at low tide.
Before long they ran aground, and the sea retreated so far that it could
hardly be seen from the ship. They were so anxious to get to land,
however, that they didn’t wait for the sea to float their ship, but ran
[a boat] ashore by way of a river that flowed into the sea from a lake.
As soon as the tide floated their ship, they rowed out to it in their
boat and moved it up the river and into the lake, where they anchored.
Then they carried their hide sleeping bags ashore and built sod
huts.</p>
<p>Later on, they decided to spend the winter there and built some large
houses. There were plenty of salmon in the river and the lake, and they
were bigger than any they had ever seen. The land seemed fertile too,
and they didn’t think they would need winter fodder for their livestock,
because there was no frost in the winter and the grass scarcely
withered. Day and night were more equal in length than in Greenland or
Iceland, for on the shortest day the sun was visible from 8:30 A.M.
until 3:30 P.M.</p>
<p>When they had finished building their houses, Leif said to his men,
“Now I want to divide our company into two groups so that we can explore
the country. Half of you will stay at the houses while the other half
explores the land. But don’t go so far that you can’t get back in the
evening, and don’t split up.”</p>
<p>This is what they did for a time. Leif alternated between staying at
home and exploring. He was a big, strong man, very impressive in
appearance. He was intelligent, too, and moderate in all things.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>It happened one evening, that a man went missing, and that man was
Tyrkir the southerner. Leif was particularly upset because Tyrkir had
lived with him and his father for a long time and had been very fond of
Leif when he was a child. Leif gave his men an angry talking to and got
ready to go looking for Tyrkir along with twelve of his men. No sooner
had they left the house than they met Tyrkir coming toward them. They
greeted him warmly, and Leif soon realized that his foster-father was in
very good spirits. Tyrkir was a small man with a bulging forehead and
squinting eyes in an insignificant little face. He was a poor-looking
creature, but expert in all sorts of crafts.</li>
</ol>
<p>“What kept you, foster-father?” asked Leif. “How did you get
separated from the others?” At first Tyrkir spoke only in German,
rolling his eyes in all directions and making peculiar grimaces, and for
a long time, they couldn’t understand a word of what he was saying.
Eventually, however, he started speaking in Norse.</p>
<p>“I didn’t go much further than you,” he said, “but I have something
astonishing to tell you: I have found vines and grapes.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure about that, foster-father?” asked Leif. “Of course I’m
sure,” replied Tyrkir. “Where I was brought up there were lots of vines
and grapes.”</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the night asleep, and, in the morning, Leif
said to his men,</p>
<p>“We’ve got two jobs to do at the moment and we’ll work on them day
about. One day we’ll gather grapes and cut vines; the next we’ll cut
down trees, to make a cargo for my ship.” And that’s what they did. The
story goes that the ship’s boat was crammed with grapes and the ship
itself had a cargo of timber.</p>
<p>When spring arrived, they got ready to set sail. Leif named the land
Vinland [Wineland] for its produce. After that they put to sea and had a
favorable wind until they saw the glacier-clad mountains of Greenland.
Then one of the crew said to Leif, “Why are you sailing so close to the
wind?”</p>
<p>“I’m watching where I’m going,” answered Leif, “but I’m watching
something else as well. Do you see anything unusual?” They replied that
they couldn’t see anything at all out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know if it’s a skerry or a ship that I’m seeing,” said
Leif. Now the crew saw something too, and said that it was a skerry.
However, Leif was further-sighted than the rest and he could make out
people on the skerry.</p>
<p>“I’m going to sail close to the wind so that we can reach these
people,” said Leif. “If they need our help, we have no choice but to
give it to them. And if it turns out that they’re unfriendly, the
advantage is all on our side, not on theirs.”</p>
<p>They approached the skerry, lowered their sail, and anchored; then
they launched another small boat they had with them. Tyrkir asked who
was in charge of the group. Their leader replied that his name was
Thorir and his family was Norwegian.</p>
<p>“And what’s your name?” asked Thorir. Leif told him who he was. “Are
you the son of Eirik the Red from Brattahlid?” said Thorir. “Yes, I am,”
replied Leif. “And I’d like to invite all of you aboard my ship with as
many of your possessions as the ship can hold.”</p>
<p>They accepted his offer and then they all sailed to Eiriksfjord with
the cargo. When they reached Brattahlid, they unloaded the ship, and
afterwards Leif invited Thorir, Gudrid his wife, and three other men to
stay with him. He also found lodgings for all the other men, both his
own and Thorir’s. Leif rescued fifteen people from the skerry; he was
known after that as Leif the Lucky. He had now become both rich and
respected. That winter Thorir and his companions came down with a
serious illness and Thorir died along with many of his men. Eirik the
Red also died that winter.</p>
<p>There was now a great deal of talk about Leif’s journey to Vinland.
His brother, Thorvald, thought that the land had not been well enough
explored, so Leif said to him,</p>
<p>“If you want to go to Vinland, brother, you can take my ship, but
first I want to send it to fetch the wood Thorir salvaged on the
skerry.” And that is what happened.</p>
