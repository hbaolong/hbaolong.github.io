<h4 id="the-voyages-of-ohthere-and-wulfstan-aaaaaaaa">1. The Voyages of
Ohthere and Wulfstan AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Ohthere, a Norwegian, explores the coastline from Halogaland in
northern Norway to the White Sea and goes on to describe the route from
his northern home to the great market town of Hedeby in Denmark.
Wulfstan’s voyage begins where Ohthere’s ends. He recounts his journey
eastward through the Baltic Sea from Hedeby to Estland, in the
northeastern part of Germany. Both narratives are interpolated in the
Old English translations of Orosius’s Historiae adversum paganos.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Voyages of Ohthere and Wulfstan,
ed. Janet Bately and Anton Eglert, Maritime Culture of the North, vol. 1
(Roskilde: The Viking Ship Museum, 2007), pp. 1–60.</p>
<p>The Voyage of Ohthere</p>
<p>Ohthere told his lord, King Alfred, that he lived farther north than
any other Norwegian. He said that he lived in the north of the country
beside the West Sea [the Atlantic]. He said that the land stretches a
long way north from there, however, though it is completely unpopulated
except for a few places here and there, where Sámi live, hunting in
winter and fishing by the sea in summer.</p>
<p>He said that on one occasion he wanted to find out how far north the
land stretched, and whether anyone lived to the north of the wilderness
area. So, he sailed north close to the coastline. For three days, he
kept the wilderness to his starboard and the open sea to port. By then
he was as far north as the whalehunters ever go. After that, he kept
traveling due north as far as he could sail in the next three days. Then
the land turned to the east, or the sea curved into the land, he did not
know which. But he did know that he waited there for a wind from the
west-northwest and afterwards sailed east along the coast as far as he
could sail in four days. Then he had to wait there for a north wind,
because the land turned due south there, or the sea turned into the
land, he did not know which. Next, he sailed south along the coast as
far as he could go in five days. There a large river [probably the
Dvina] stretched into the land. They turned into the river, not daring
to travel beyond it for fear of hostility, because the land on the other
side of the river was thickly settled. Until now, he had not come across
any populated land since leaving his own home; but all the way there was
empty land to starboard except for fishermen, fowlers, and hunters, and
they were all Sámi and to port there was always the open sea. The
Biarmians had settled their land thickly, but they [Ohthere and crew]
dared not set foot there. The land of the Ter Sámi [southeast Kola
Peninsula?], however, was completely uninhabited except for hunters,
fishermen, or fowlers.</p>
<p>The Biarmians told him many tales both about their own land and about
the lands which lay around them, but he did not know how true these
tales were because he did not see anything for himself. It seemed to him
that the Sámi and the Biarmians spoke much the same language.</p>
<p>In addition to exploring the land, he traveled there mainly for the
walrus, because they have very fine bone in their teeth—they brought
some teeth for the king—and their hide is very good for ships’ ropes.
This whale is much smaller than other whales, being no more than seven
ells long [an English ell is 1.14 meters]. But the best whale hunting is
in his own land where the whales are forty-eight ells long, and the
biggest fifty ells in length. He said that he and six other men killed
sixty of them in two days.</p>
<p>He was a very well-to-do man, rich in the possessions which comprise
their wealth, namely wild beasts. When he visited the king, he still had
six hundred unsold animals. These animals are called reindeer. Six of
them were decoy reindeer; these are highly prized by the Sámi because
they catch wild reindeer with them. He was one of the most prominent men
in that land, yet he had no more than twenty cattle, twenty sheep, and
twenty pigs, and the little that he plowed, he plowed with horses. Their
wealth, however, consists mainly of the tribute paid to them by the
Sámi. This tribute consists of animal hides, bird feathers, whale bone,
and ships’ cables made from whale and seal skins. Each man pays
according to his rank. The highest ranking must give fifteen marten
skins, five reindeer hides, a bear skin, ten ambers of feathers, a bear
or otter skin coat, and two ships’ cables, each sixty ells long, one
made from whale skin and the other from seal skin.</p>
<p>He said that the land of the Norwegians is very long and very narrow.
All the land that can be grazed or plowed lies beside the sea, and even
that is very rocky in places. Above and to the east lie wild,
mountainous wastelands, stretching all along the length of the inhabited
land. Sámi inhabit the wasteland. The inhabited land is broadest to the
east [that is, in the south of Norway] and the farther north it lies,
the narrower it becomes. To the east, it can be sixty miles broad, or
slightly broader, and in the middle, it can be thirty miles or broader.
To the north, where it is narrowest, he said, it might be only three
miles broad before becoming wasteland. In some places the wasteland is
as wide as a man can cross in two weeks; in others, as wide as a man can
cross in six days. Alongside the southern part of the land, on the other
side of the wasteland, Sweden stretches up to the northern part of
Norway, and adjacent to the northern part of Norway is Cwenland [land of
the Sámi]. Sometimes, the Sámi harry the Norwegians across the waste
land, and at other times the Norwegians raid them. There are huge
freshwater lakes throughout the wastelands; the Sámi carry their boats
overland to the lakes and raid the Norwegians from there. They have very
small, light boats.</p>
<p>Ohthere said that the district where he lived is called Halogaland
and that no one lived to the north of him. In the south of that land is
a port called Skiringssal [Kaupang]. He said that a man could not sail
there in a month if he camped at night and had a favorable wind every
day. And all the while, he must sail along the coast, and to his
starboard, first there will be Ireland and then the islands [Orkneys and
Shetlands] between Ireland and this land [Britain]. Then Britain is to
starboard until he comes to Skiringssal and, all the way, Norway is to
port. South of Skiringssal, a very large sea cuts deeply into the land;
it is broader than anyone can see across. Jutland is opposite on the
other side and then Sillende [central and southern Denmark]. The sea
flows many hundreds of miles into the land. From Skiringssal, he said
that he sailed for five days to the port called Hedeby which stands
between the Wends, the Saxons, and the Angles and belongs to the Danes.
When he sailed there from Skiringssal, Denmark was on his port side for
three days and open sea on his starboard. Then, for two days before he
came to Hedeby, Jutland, Sillende, and many islands lay to starboard—the
Angles lived in these places before they came to this land [England]—and
for these two days the islands that belong to Denmark lay to port.</p>
<p>The Voyage of Wulfstan</p>
<p>Wulfstan said that he traveled seven days and nights from Hedeby
before arriving in Truso and that the ship ran under sail the whole way.
Wendland [Pomerania] was to starboard and to port were Langeland,
Laaland, Falster, and Skåne. These lands all belong to Denmark. Next,
Bornholm lay to port, and the people there have their own king. After
Bornholm came Blekinge, Möre, Öland, and Gotland; and these lands belong
to the Swedes. Wendland was to our starboard all the way to the mouth of
the Vistula. The Vistula is a very big river which separates Witland and
Wendland, and Witland belongs to the Ests [Estonians]. The Vistula flows
out of Wendland and into Frisches Haff, and Frisches Haff is about
fifteen miles wide. Then the Elbing comes into Frisches Haff from the
east, from the lake on whose bank Truso stands. And these rivers flow
together into Frisches Haff, the Elbing from Estland in the east and the
Vistula from Wendland in the south. The Elbing then adopts the Vistula’s
name and flows west and north from the lake to the sea; for this reason
it is called the mouth of the Vistula.</p>
<p>Estland is very large. There are a great many towns and in each one
there is a king. There is a great deal of honey and fishing. The king
and the most powerful men drink mare’s milk while the poor and the
slaves drink mead. There is much conflict among them. No ale is brewed
by the Ests, but there is plenty of mead.</p>
<p>It is an Est custom that, when a man dies, he lies indoors uncremated
in the midst of his kinsmen and friends for a month, or sometimes two.
Kings and other high-ranking men have a longer lying-in, proportionate
with the size of their wealth; sometimes they lie uncremated for half a
year, above ground in their houses. As long as the corpse is in the
house, there must be drinking and entertainment until the day they
cremate him. On the day that they intend to carry him to the funeral
pyre, they divide up what remains of his property after the drinking and
entertainment into five or six parts, and sometimes more, depending on
the amount of property. They deposit the largest portion about a mile
from the settlement, then the second largest, and then the third until
it is all laid out within that single mile. The smallest portion must be
closest to the settlement where the dead man is lying. Next, all the men
with the swiftest horses in the land must be assembled about five or six
miles from the property. Then they all gallop toward it. The man who has
the fastest horse comes to the first and largest portion, and so on, one
after another, until everything is taken. The smallest portion goes to
the man who gallops closest to the settlement to get it. Each man then
rides on his way with the property; they may take everything, and that
is why fast horses are excessively expensive there. When all the
treasure is dispersed, the dead man is carried out and cremated with his
weapons and clothes. Almost all of his wealth is used up by the long
lying-in of the dead man, and also by the laying out of his property for
strangers to gallop toward and take. It is an Est custom that everyone
must be cremated there; and if even one bone is found unburned, they
must make great atonement for it. Among the Ests there is a group of
people who understand the process of freezing. And the reason why the
dead men lie there so long without decaying is that they freeze them. If
two vessels full of water or ale are set down, they cause one of the two
to freeze over, in summer and winter alike.</p>
