Old Gods AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>According to his saga, Hallfred Vandrædaskald (the Troublesome Poet)
was a court poet who found it difficult to turn his back on Odin, the
god who had blessed him and his ancestors with the gift of poetry. His
reluctance to convert earned him his soubriquet from Olaf
Tryggvason.</p>

<li>The Christianization of Norway Under Saint Olaf</li>
</ol>
<p>Olaf Haraldsson, or Olaf II (ca 990–1030), was the son of a minor
Norwegian king. After time spent raiding in England, he seized the
Norwegian throne and completed the unification of Norway begun by his
great-grandfather, Harald Finehair. Part of his ambition was to spread
Christianity to all Norwegians. This he did with a singular ferocity.
His high-handedness caused his subjects to rebel against him, and he was
forced from the throne in 1028. He attempted to regain his throne two
years later, but was defeated and killed at the Battle of Stiklestad
(see doc. 87).</p>
<p>Source: trans. A. A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Óláfs saga
Helga, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk fornrit
XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 2, pp. 100–1, 177–90.</p>
<ol start="73" type="1">
<li>After King Olaf had sent Bjorn and his followers east to Gotland, he
dispatched other men to the Upplands with instructions to arrange
accommodation and provisions for him. They were also to let it be known
that he intended to make a progress across the Upplands that winter, for
it had been the custom of previous kings to spend every third winter
there.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the autumn the king set off from Borg and headed first to
Vengilmark. He had planned his journey so that he could be entertained
for a time in the neighborhood of the forest settlements, and he
summoned all the forest dwellers to meet him there, particularly those
who lived furthest from the main settlements. He questioned them closely
about their adherence to Christianity, and where he found shortcomings,
he instructed them in the true faith. Anyone who would not renounce
heathen beliefs was severely punished. Some were banished from the
country. Others had their hands or feet cut off, or their eyes put out.
Some were hanged and others beheaded; no one who refused to serve God
escaped punishment. King Olaf proceeded in this fashion throughout the
entire district, punishing the mighty and the humble alike. He also
provided the people with priests, giving every district as many priests
as he thought necessary.</p>
<p>When he went up to Raumarik, King Olaf had three hundred and sixty
armed men with him. He soon discovered that loyalty to Christianity
decreased as he traveled up country, so he continued his policy of
converting everyone to the true faith and meting out terrible
punishments to those who refused to obey him….</p>
<ol start="107" type="1">
<li>That autumn, King Olaf got word that the farmers of inner Trondheim
had held great feasts on the winter-nights [the three days beginning
winter]. There had been a great deal of drinking and all the toasts had
been dedicated to the Aesir in accordance with ancient custom. He was
told also that cattle and horses had been slaughtered and altars covered
with their blood; sacrifices had been performed, and prayers said for a
good harvest. It was also reported that everyone was sure the gods were
angry because the people of Halogaland had turned to Christianity.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the king heard this, he sent messengers to inner Trondheim to
summon certain farmers whom he specified by name. One of these was Olvir
from Eggja, who was named for the farm on which he lived. This Olvir was
a powerful and well-born man; he was the leader of the deputation that
went to the king on behalf of the farmers. When they met, the king
voiced his charges against the farmers, but Olvir replied on the
farmers’ behalf that there had been no feasts that autumn, only social
gatherings and drinking sessions and friendly get-togethers.</p>
<p>“As for what you’ve been told about what we Trondheimers say when
we’ve been drinking, intelligent men pay no attention to talk like that,
and I can’t be held reponsible for the remarks of fools and drunks,”
said Olvir.</p>
<p>Olvir was eloquent and outspoken. He defended the farmers against all
these accusations and, in the end, the king said that the Trondheimers
themselves would have to demonstrate their loyalty to the faith. Then
they got leave to go home and left as soon as possible.</p>
<ol start="108" type="1">
<li>Later in the winter, the king heard that the people of inner
Trondheim had held a large gathering at Maeren and had offered up huge
sacrifices there at midwinter to ensure peace and a mild winter. When
the king felt he was quite sure of the facts, he dispatched messengers
to the inner districts to summon the farmers to town. Once again he
named those whom he considered most astute. The farmers met to discuss
this message. All those who had gone earlier in the winter were very
reluctant to make the trip but, in response to the farmers’ entreaties,
Olvir undertook the journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>When Olvir reached town, he went straight to King Olaf and they
talked together. The king charged the farmers with offering midwinter
sacrifices, and Olvir asserted their innocence.</p>
<p>“We held Yule-tide banquets and drinking parties throughout the
district,” said Olvir, “and the farmers don’t stint when preparing their
banquets so there was plenty of ale left over, and they were still
drinking it long afterwards. In Maeren there is a great estate with a
big house and an extensive settlement around it. People really enjoy
having large drinking parties there.”</p>
<p>The king said little in response and appeared to be rather angry for
he felt sure that he wasn’t being told the truth. He ordered the farmers
to go home.</p>
<p>“However,” he said, “I’ll get to the bottom of this even though you
conceal the truth and refuse to admit it. And whatever you’ve done in
the past, don’t do it again.”</p>
<p>The farmers went home and gave an account of their journey; they said
that the king was very irate.</p>
<ol start="109" type="1">
<li>At Easter, King Olaf held a large feast to which he invited many of
the townspeople and farmers, but after Easter, he had his ships
launched. Tackle and oars were taken aboard, decks were laid, and
awnings put up, and when the ships were all fitted out, they were
floated at the piers, ready to put to sea.</li>
</ol>
<p>After Easter, King Olaf sent messengers to Veradal where he had a
steward named Thorald who managed his farm at Haug. The king sent word
that Thorald was to come to him as quickly as possible, and Thorald did
not delay, but traveled to town immediately along with the messengers.
The king summoned him for a private conversation.</p>
<p>“Is there any truth to what I’ve been hearing about the conduct of
the people in the Inner Trondelag?” he asked. “Are they turning to
heathen sacrifices? I want you to tell me the facts as you know them.
It’s your duty to tell me the truth, because you are my man.”</p>
<p>“My lord, there’s something I wish to tell you first,” replied
Thorald. “I’ve moved my two sons and my wife into town and I’ve also
brought as much of my portable property as possible. If you want me to
tell you what’s going on, I’ll do as you command. But if I tell you,
then you must protect me and my family.”</p>
<p>“Answer my questions truthfully and I’ll see to it that you come to
no harm,” said the king.</p>
<p>“To tell you the truth, sire, nearly everyone from the Inner
Trondelag is heathen, even though some have been baptized,” said
Thorald. “It’s their custom to offer a sacrifice in autumn to welcome
winter, another in midwinter, and a third to welcome the arrival of
summer. And this is the practice of the people in Eyna, Sparby, Veradal,
and Skaun. There are twelve men who make the arrangements for the
sacrificial banquets, and this spring it’s Olvir’s turn to organize the
feast. At the moment he’s very busy making preparations for it at
Maeren, and all the necessary provisions are being brought there.”</p>
<p>When the king learned the truth, he had trumpets blown to summon his
troops together. Then he ordered them to board their ships. He selected
steersmen and troop-leaders and told each company which ship to board.
Everything was done very quickly; then King Olaf sailed inland along the
fjord with 360 men in five ships. The wind was favorable and the
longships made good headway. No one had anticipated that the king would
reach Maeren so quickly; he got there during the night and immediately
threw a cordon around the house. Olvir was captured, and King Olaf had
him executed along with many other men. Then the king had his ships
loaded with all the provisions for the feast and all the
property—furnishings, clothes, and valuables—that had been brought
there. All this was divided among the king’s men as spoils of war. The
king also ordered an attack on the homes of those farmers who had been
most involved in the affair. Some were captured and put in irons, others
fled, and some had their property confiscated.</p>
<p>Then King Olaf called the farmers to a meeting. Because the king had
captured so many of the farmers’ leading men and had them in his power,
their relatives and friends decided to promise obedience to him, and
there was no uprising against the king at this time. He converted
everyone to the true faith, settled priests among them, and had churches
built and consecrated.</p>
<p>The king declared that no compensation would be paid for Olvir’s
death, and confiscated all his property. As for the other men, the most
blameworthy were executed, mutilated, exiled, or fined. Then King Olaf
went back to Nidaros….</p>
<ol start="112" type="1">
<li>There was a man called Guthbrand of the Dales who ruled like a king
over the valley where he lived although he was only a Hersir. In terms
of power and property, Sigvat the Skald compared Guthbrand with Erling
Skjalgsson, and this is what Sigvat said about Erling:</li>
</ol>
<p>I knew only one shield-breaker</p>
<p>who came close to you;</p>
<p>his name was Guthbrand; this guardian</p>
<p>of men governed far and wide.</p>
<p>Gold-giver, I declare that</p>
<p>you two are equally great;</p>
<p>he who boasts he is better</p>
<p>only deceives himself.</p>
<p>Guthbrand had a son who comes into this story. When Guthbrand heard
that King Olaf had come to Loar and that he was compelling people to
adopt Christianity, he sent round a war-arrow and summoned all the
Dalesmen to meet him at a farm called Hundthorp. They all came, and
there were a great many of them, because Hundthorp was near a lake
called Lauger and so men could get there by land or water with equal
ease. Then Guthbrand called a meeting and addressed them, saying,</p>
<p>“A man by the name of Olaf has come to Loar intending to force us to
adopt a new faith, different from the one we have held till now. He
wants us to destroy all our gods, claiming that his god is much greater
and stronger. It’s strange that the earth doesn’t open up under his feet
when he says such things and that our gods allow him to go on living.
But Thor has always supported us, and I’m certain that if we carry him
from his place in the temple, here on this farm, then Olaf, his god, and
his men will all vanish into nothing, as soon as he looks at them.”</p>
<p>They all cheered and said that if Olaf came to Hundthorp, he would
never escape alive. “And he won’t dare go further south through the
Dales,” they said.</p>
<p>Then they assigned 840 men to reconnoiter northwards as far as
Breida. This force was led by Guthbrand’s eighteen-year-old son and many
first-rate men went with him. They came to a farm called Hof and, after
they had been there for three days, they were joined by a large number
of people who had fled from Lesjar, Loar, and Vaga because they did not
want to become Christian.</p>
<p>King Olaf and Bishop Sigurd left priests behind in Loar and Vaga.
Then they went over Vagarost and came down to Sil, where they stayed
overnight. There they heard the news that a large army was lying in wait
for them. At the same time, the farmers at Breida heard about Olaf’s
approach and got ready to fight him. When King Olaf got up, he dressed
in his war-gear and moved south along the Sil Plains. He did not stop
until he reached Breida, where he found himself confronted by a large
army ready for battle. Then the king drew up his forces; he himself rode
at their head. He addressed the farmers and bade them adopt
Christianity.</p>
<p>But they replied, “You’ll be doing a bit more than mocking us
today.”</p>
<p>And with that, they raised a battle-cry and clashed their weapons
against their shields.</p>
<p>Then the king’s men rushed forward and hurled their spears. The
farmers immediately took to their heels; very few of them stood their
ground. Guthbrand’s son was captured and was granted quarter by the
king, who kept the young man with him. The king remained there for four
days. Then he said to Guthbrand’s son,</p>
<p>“Go back to your father and tell him I’ll be with him soon.” So he
went back to his father and told him the bad news that they had met the
king and fought with him.</p>
<p>“Right at the start, our whole army was put to flight, and I was
taken prisoner,” he said. “The king gave me quarter and told me to tell
you that he’ll be here soon. Now we have only a couple of hundred left
out of all the men that we sent against him. So my advice to you,
father, is don’t fight against this man.”</p>
<p>“Clearly, you’ve had the stuffing knocked out of you,” said
Guthbrand. “Your expedition was ill-fated, and it will be a long time
before you live it down. And now you can’t wait to swallow all the
nonsense this man is putting about, even after the disgrace he has
inflicted on you and your army.”</p>
<p>That night, Guthbrand dreamed that a man appeared before him. He came
in a blaze of light and inspired great awe.</p>
<p>“Your son did not have a successful foray against King Olaf,” he
said, “and you will fare even worse if you insist on fighting with the
king, for you and your entire army will perish; wolves will drag you and
your men away and ravens will tear your flesh.”</p>
<p>Guthbrand was terrified by this dreadful vision and spoke about his
dream to Thord Paunch-Belly who was a chieftain in the Dales.</p>
<p>“I had the same dream,” said Thord.</p>
<p>In the morning, they had the trumpets blown to summon an assembly and
announced that it would be advisable to meet this man who had come from
the north with a new creed, and find out if there was any truth in what
he was saying. Guthbrand said to his son, “Take twelve men and go back
to this king who gave you quarter.” He did so.</p>
<p>When they came to the king, they gave him the message that the
farmers wanted to have a meeting with him, and that they wanted to
arrange a truce between the two sides. King Olaf was amenable to this
and they made a formal agreement to observe a truce for the duration of
the meeting. After everything had been arranged, they went back to tell
Guthbrand and Thord that a truce had been agreed.</p>
<p>The king then moved to a farm called Lidstad. He stayed there for
five days and afterwards he went to meet the farmers. There was heavy
rain that day. When the meeting began, the king stood up and told the
farmers that the people of Leyjar, Loar, and Vagi had all become
Christian and had demolished their temples.</p>
<p>“And now they believe in the true God who made heaven and earth and
who knows all things,” said King Olaf. Then he sat down.</p>
<p>“We have no idea who you’re talking about,” responded Guthbrand. “Do
you call him a god when neither you nor anyone else can see him? We have
a god who can be seen every day, though he isn’t out today because the
weather is wet. He will seem terrifying and majestic to you, and I
expect that you’ll be overwhelmed by fear if he comes to the meeting.
But since you say that your god is so powerful, let him make tomorrow’s
weather overcast, but not rainy, and let us meet here then.”</p>
<p>The king returned to where he was staying and Guthbrand’s son went
with him as a hostage. The king also left a hostage with the farmers. In
the evening, the king asked Guthbrand’s son what form their god took. He
answered that their god looked like Thor.</p>
<p>“He’s big and has a hammer in his hand. He is hollow and has a
pedestal to stand on when he is outdoors. His body is adorned with lots
of gold and silver, and every day he receives four loaves of bread and
meat as well.” After that, they went to bed, but the king stayed awake
all night, praying.</p>
<p>Next morning, King Olaf heard mass and had breakfast. Then he went to
the meeting. The weather was cloudy, but not rainy, just as Guthbrand
had wished. The bishop stood up, dressed in his robes and wearing a
miter on his head; in his hand, he held a crozier. He preached the
Christian faith to the farmers, telling them about many miracles that
God had performed. Then he ended his speech eloquently, and Thord
Paunch-Belly replied,</p>
<p>“He certainly has a lot to say—this horned man with the curly-ended
staff in his hand. And now, since you folks claim that your god performs
so many miracles, ask him to make the sky bright and sunny tomorrow
morning before dawn. Let’s meet then and either come to an agreement
about this business or else settle it in battle.” With that, they
parted.</p>
<ol start="113" type="1">
<li>One of King Olaf’s followers was a man called Kolbein the Strong,
whose family came from the Fjord district. He always wore a sword and
carried a thick staff, or club, in his hand. The king told Kolbein to
stand next to him in the morning. Then he ordered his men to go to the
farmers’ ships during the night and drill holes in them. He also ordered
them to drive the farmers’ horses away from the farms where they were
being kept. The men did so, and the king spent the night in prayer,
asking God to deliver him from this trouble through his mercy and
grace.</li>
</ol>
<p>At daybreak, King Olaf heard mass and went to the meeting. When he
got there, some of the farmers had already shown up. Then they saw a
great crowd of farmers making their way to the meeting and carrying
among them a large effigy of a man decorated with gold and silver. When
the farmers already at the meeting saw this, they leapt to their feet
and bowed to the idol. The figure was placed in the middle of the
meeting-area, with the farmers sitting on one side and the king and his
men on the other.</p>
<p>Guthbrand of the Dales stood up and spoke. “Where is your god now,
king? I think he must be hanging his head. And it seems to me that you
and the horned fellow next to you—the one you call bishop—aren’t
bragging quite so much as you were yesterday, now that our god, the
ruler of all, has come and is glaring at you with his piercing gaze. I
can see that you’re terrified and hardly dare raise your eyes to look at
him. Now drop your superstitious nonsense and have faith in our god, who
holds your fate in his hands.” With that, he ended his speech.</p>
<p>The king spoke to Kolbein without attracting the farmers’
attention.</p>
<p>“If they happen to take their eyes off their god while I’m speaking,
hit it as hard as you can with your club.” Then he stood up and
addressed the meeting.</p>
<p>“You have said a great deal to us this morning. You think it’s
strange that you can’t see our god, but we expect he’ll come to us very
soon. You threaten us with your god, who is both blind and deaf, and who
can’t protect himself or anyone else, and can’t move from his place
unless he’s carried. I expect he’ll be in for a rough time before long,
for if you look eastwards, you will see our god approaching in great
brightness.”</p>
<p>Then the sun rose, and all the farmers turned to look at it. At that
very moment, Kolbein struck their god so hard that it shattered and out
of it leapt vipers, lizards, and mice as big as cats. The farmers were
so terrified that they fled. Some made for their ships but, when they
launched them, water poured in and swamped them, and the farmers could
not get aboard. Those who ran for their horses could not find them.</p>
<p>Then the king had the farmers called back, saying that he wanted to
talk to them. So the farmers returned and the meeting began again. The
king stood up and spoke.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what all this noise and running to and fro is about,”
said King Olaf. “But now you can see what power this god of yours has.
You gave him gold, silver, food, and provisions, and look at what sort
of creatures have enjoyed it all—mice, lizards, adders, and toads.
Anyone who has faith in such stuff, and won’t abandon his foolishness,
is making a bad mistake. Take your gold and valuables that are strewn
about this field; carry them home to your wives, and never again offer
them to idols of wood or stone. And now we can settle this business in
one of two ways: either you adopt Christianity today or we resort to
battle and let the god in whom we trust award victory to whichever side
he pleases.”</p>
<p>Then Guthbrand stood up and spoke. “We’ve suffered a great deal of
harm because of our god and, since he couldn’t help us, we will now
believe in the god that you believe in.”</p>
<p>Everyone was converted to Christianity. The bishop baptized Guthbrand
and his son and left priests in the district. So the former enemies
parted as friends; and Guthbrand had a church built in the Dales.</p>
