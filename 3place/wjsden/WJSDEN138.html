State-Making in Denmark: Unification and Expansion</h4>
<p>Knýtlinga saga (The Story of the Family of Knut) is an anonymous
chronicle that was probably written in Iceland during the thirteenth
century. The author may have been Sturla Thordarson, the nephew of
Snorri Sturluson. The saga covers Danish history from the age of Harald
Gormsson in the ninth century until the late twelfth century. This
section gives an account of Harald Gormsson and the unification of
Denmark, while document 104 deals with the expansion of Danish power to
England.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Knýtlinga saga, in Danakonunga
sögur, ed. Bjarni Guðnason, Íslenzk fornrit XXXV (Reykjavík, 1982),
pp. 93–98.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>After the death of his father, Gorm the Old, Harald Gormsson became
king of Denmark. He was a powerful king and a mighty warrior who
conquered Holstein in Saxony. He also ruled a large earldom in Wendland
where he built Jomsborg and manned it with a large force. He paid the
garrison and granted them certain rights and privileges; they held the
place under his auspices. In summer, they went raiding and, during the
winter, they stayed at home. They were known as the Jomsvikings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Lives of the Kings of Norway record that King Harald Gormsson
engineered the betrayal and death of King Harald Gunnhildarson of Norway
when he died at Hals in Limafjord [976 CE]. Then King Harald Gormsson
invaded Norway with his army and brought the whole country under his
authority. He established Earl Hakon Sigurdarson as ruler of Norway, but
he himself, as king of the Danes, levied tribute from the whole
country.</p>
<p>In the days of King Harald Gormsson, Otto the Red [Otto II, 955–983]
was emperor of Germany. He made war on King Harald and ordered the Danes
to convert to Christianity, but the king of the Danes, who would not
adopt Christianity on any account, called out his army against Otto.</p>
<p>King Harald Gormsson and Earl Hakon of Norway engaged Otto in a great
battle at the Danevirk, in the south of Denmark. The emperor was
defeated there, but shortly afterwards he subdued the country and put
Harald and Hakon to flight, driving them all the way north to Limafjord
and Marsey. After this, King Harald adopted Christianity and the emperor
became godfather to his son, Svein. At the baptism, Otto gave Svein his
own name so that afterwards he was known as Otto-Svein. Everyone in
Denmark was converted to Christianity since the emperor would settle for
nothing less.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Styrbjorn the Strong was the son of Olaf Bjarnarson, king of Sweden.
In the time of King Harald Gormsson, he made a foray into the eastern
Baltic, invaded Denmark, and took King Harald prisoner. So Harald gave
Styrbjorn his daughter, Thyri, in marriage and then traveled to Sweden
with him. Before going ashore, Styrbjorn burned all his ships, and as
soon as King Harald realized that Styrbjorn was shipless, he sailed to
Lake Malaren and from there back to Denmark.</li>
</ol>
<p>At Fyrisvellir [Fyris Plains], Styrbjorn fought against his uncle,
King Eirik the Victorious of Sweden [Eirik I, ca 945–ca 995], and
perished there along with most of his army, though some of them did
escape. The Swedes call the battle Fyriselta [the Hunt at Fyris].</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>When King Harald Gormsson was baptized, as already mentioned, he
forced Earl Hakon Sigurdarson to adopt the Christian faith, and he was
also baptized along with all the men who had accompanied him from
Norway. King Harald supplied him with priests and other clerics and
directed him to have everyone in Norway baptized. Hakon swore that he
would do so.</li>
</ol>
<p>When the king and the earl parted, Hakon made for Norway and, en
route, put the holy men ashore at Hals in Limafjord. He turned his back
on Christianity and afterwards offered up huge pagan sacrifices in
Norway. When King Harald heard that Hakon had rejected Christianity and
raided his territory, he led his army to Norway and laid waste the
coastal area, burning everything from Lindnes to Stad, except for five
farms at Laeradale in Sogn. The whole population fled to the mountains
and forests, taking with them whatever property they could.</p>
<p>King Harald and his army remained at the Solund Islands for some
time. He was planning to raid Iceland with the forces he had on hand
since he wanted revenge for the insulting and derisory verses leveled at
him by the Icelanders. King Harald ordered a man with supernatural
powers to go there in an assumed shape and tell him what he could find
out about the place. The man circled Iceland in the form of a whale and
later told the king that there were many monsters living there. He also
said there was too much open sea between Norway and Iceland for
longships to cross. When King Harald heard this, he realized that the
enterprise would be hugely daunting and probably couldn’t be carried
out.</p>
<p>After his raid in Norway, Harald Gormsson returned to Denmark with
his army, while Earl Hakon had all the devastated land in Norway
resettled and never again paid tribute to the king of the Danes.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>Svein, son of King Harald Gormsson, asked his father for a share
in the kingdom, but his father didn’t care for him much since he was the
son of one of his mistresses and so he was reluctant to give him any
part of the kingdom to govern. When Svein came of age, he got himself
some men and ships and went raiding far and wide, at home and abroad.
King Harald was enraged and gathered an army against him. Svein was
joined by Palna-Toki, his foster-father, as the Jomsvikings’ saga
records. They headed for Sjaelland and went up Isafjord where they found
King Harald already waiting with his ships. Svein sailed to the attack
immediately and there was a great fight. But then, a great number of men
joined the king’s army so that Svein was overwhelmed and had to flee.
King Harald was mortally wounded by an arrow in the battle. He was the
first Danish king to be buried in consecrated ground; by then, he had
been king for eighty years: thirty years while his father, Gorm, was
alive, and fifty years after that.</p></li>
<li><p>After the death of his father, King Harald, Svein became king of
Denmark [Svein I, ca 960–1014]. He was called Svein Forkbeard and was a
powerful king. It was in his days that Earl Sigvald and the rest of the
Jomsvikings went to Norway and fought against Earl Hakon at Hjorunga
Fjord in Møre. Bui Digri died in this battle, but Earl Sigvald got away.
After that, the kings of Denmark lost control of Norway and shortly
afterwards Olaf Tryggvason came to Norway and seized power.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>King Svein married Gunnhild, daughter of Burizlaf, king of the Wends.
Their sons were Knut and Harald. Next, he married Sigrid the Proud,
daughter of Skoglar-Tosti and mother of Olaf, king of Sweden, from an
earlier marriage to Eirik the Victorious, king of Sweden. Svein and
Sigrid had a daughter called Astrid who married Earl Ulf, the son of
Thorgil the Ambitious. Their sons were Svein and Bjorn. Another of Svein
Forkbeard’s daughters was Gytha, who married Eirik Hakonarson in Norway.
Their son was the Earl Hakon who was captured by Saint Olaf at
Sauthungsund.</p>
<p>King Svein Forkbeard was present at the death of Olaf Tryggvason [see
doc. 37a] at the Battle of Svold [1000 CE], as were his stepson, King
Olaf of Sweden, and his son-in-law, Earl Eirik. After the death of Olaf
Tryggvason, each of these three got a third of Norway.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>King Svein was a mighty warrior and a very powerful king. He raided
far and wide, both in the eastern Baltic and in Saxony to the south.
Finally, he took his army west to England where he campaigned
extensively and fought many battles. At this time, Athelred son of Edgar
was king of England. He and Svein fought frequently; both had their
victories, but Svein conquered most of England and stayed there for many
years, raiding and burning throughout the country. People referred to
him as “England’s Devil.” In the midst of the warfare, King Athelred
fled the country, but then King Svein died suddenly in his bed one night
and Englishmen claim that King Edmund the saint had killed him just as
Saint Mercurius killed Julian the Apostate [emperor of Rome,
361–363].</li>
