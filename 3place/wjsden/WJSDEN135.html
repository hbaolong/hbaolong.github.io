<h4 id="the-travels-of-king-sigurd-jerusalem-farer-aaaaaaaa">98. The
Travels of King Sigurd, Jerusalem-Farer AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Sigurd Magnusson (Sigurd I, King of Norway, 1103–30) was the first
European king to go on a crusade. This exploit won him the title
Jorsalafari (Jerusalem-Farer). He set out in 1107 and fought several
battles in Portugal and the Mediterranean before reaching Palestine. He
was with Baldwin I, King of Jerusalem, when the city of Sidon was taken
in 1110. Sigurd’s career demonstrates the progression from Vikings to
Crusaders. From The Saga of the Sons of Magnus Barelegs.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Magnússona
saga, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk fornrit
XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 3, pp. 239–54.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Four years after the death of Magnus Barelegs, King Sigurd left
Norway with his army [1107]. He had sixty ships, as Thorarin Stuttfeld
says:</li>
</ol>
<p>At the wish of the wise</p>
<p>king, there came together</p>
<p>a great force faithful</p>
<p>to the powerful prince,</p>
<p>and sixty sleek-sided</p>
<p>ships took to sea and sped</p>
<p>across the waves by the will</p>
<p>of gracious God.</p>
<p>In the autumn, King Sigurd sailed to England. At that time, the king
there was Henry, the son of William the Bastard. King Sigurd stayed
there over the winter, as Einar Skulason says:</p>
<p>The resolute ruler sailed</p>
<p>west with his warriors;</p>
<p>the sea-strider [ship]</p>
<p>carried the king to England.</p>
<p>The war-wise prince</p>
<p>rested his ship on the shore,</p>
<p>waited out winter; a better</p>
<p>lord never landed there.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>The following spring, King Sigurd sailed west to France with his
forces and in autumn got as far as Galicia [in Spain] where he spent his
second winter. Einar Skulasson says:</li>
</ol>
<p>The ruler of the greatest realm</p>
<p>beneath the circling sun</p>
<p>spent the second winter</p>
<p>in the homeland of holy St. James;</p>
<p>the people’s prince, I hear,</p>
<p>repaid the evil earl</p>
<p>for his falseness and fed</p>
<p>the black swan of battle.</p>
<p>What happened was this: the earl who ruled that land made an
agreement with King Sigurd to set up a market where he could buy food
over the winter. The arrangement worked until Yule when food became
scarce, for the land was barren and unproductive. King Sigurd then led
his troops to the earl’s castle, and the earl fled since he had few
soldiers. The king seized a great deal of food and other plunder there
and had it carried to his ships. Then he got ready to leave and set out
westward along the Spanish coast. As he was sailing along the coast,
some pirates who were looking for plunder headed toward him with a fleet
of galleys. King Sigurd went on the attack in what was his first battle
with heathens [Muslims] and captured eight of their galleys. Halldor
Skvaldri says:</p>
<p>The craven corsairs advanced</p>
<p>to meet the mighty prince,</p>
<p>but our king cut down</p>
<p>the shield-sheltered warriors.</p>
<p>Eight galleys in all were</p>
<p>cleared in a quick battle;</p>
<p>our lord had few losses,</p>
<p>our prince took great plunder.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Sigurd headed for the stronghold called Sintre [Cintra]
where he fought his second battle in Spain [now Portugal]. The castle
was occupied by heathens who were carrying out raids against Christians,
and when Sigurd took the castle, he killed everyone in it because they
refused to become Christian. He also took a lot of property there, as
Halldor Skvaldri says:</p>
<p>I shall tell of daring deeds</p>
<p>done by our gold-giver</p>
<p>in Spain with his spirited</p>
<p>attack on Sintre;</p>
<p>for his foes,</p>
<p>who refused the rule of Christ,</p>
<p>it was a struggle to stand</p>
<p>against the grim prince.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>After that, King Sigurd and his fleet made for Lisbon, a large town
in Spain, which is half Christian and half heathen. Lisbon separates
Christian Spain from heathen [Muslim] Spain; all the districts to the
west are heathen. There, King Sigurd had his third battle against
heathens; he was victorious and acquired a great deal of plunder. As
Halldor Skvaldri says:</li>
</ol>
<p>Courageous son of a king,</p>
<p>your third time to triumph was</p>
<p>at Lisbon when you landed</p>
<p>on that southern shore.</p>
<p>King Sigurd and his fleet continued to head west along the coast of
heathen [Muslim] Spain and proceeded to the town called Alkasse [Alcacer
do Sal] where he had his fourth battle with heathens. He took the town
and killed so many people that the place was deserted. They got a huge
amount of booty there. As Halldor Skvaldri says:</p>
<p>War-lord, I hear how</p>
<p>eagerly at Alkasse</p>
<p>you fought a fourth</p>
<p>brisk battle and won.</p>
<p>And he says this, too:</p>
<p>I hear that heathen women</p>
<p>sorrowed in a deserted city,</p>
<p>when all the army</p>
<p>was forced to flee.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>King Sigurd pressed on with his journey and headed for Norvasund
[Strait of Gibraltar], where he came across a large fleet of pirates and
attacked them. This was his fifth battle against heathens, and he won.
As Halldor Skvaldri says:</li>
</ol>
<p>Bold, you bloodied</p>
<p>sword edges in the east;</p>
<p>god gave you help, ravens gorged</p>
<p>when you sailed through the straits.</p>
<p>King Sigurd sailed south along the coast of Serkland [southern Spain]
until he arrived at an island called Formentera. A large number of black
heathens had settled in a cave there and had built a stone wall in front
of the cave mouth. They raided far and wide throughout the land and
brought all their plunder to the cave. King Sigurd came ashore and made
his way to the cave, which was high up in a cliff. It was a steep climb
to the wall, and the cliff jutted out above it. The heathens defended
the wall without fear of the Norsemen’s weapons, for they could bombard
the men below them with spears and rocks and, in these circumstances,
the Norsemen were unwilling to attack them. Then the heathens carried
costly material and other valuable items to the wall and waved them at
the Norsemen, shouting at them, goading them, and taunting them with
lack of spirit.</p>
<p>King Sigurd now came up with a plan. He had two boats hauled up to
the cliff-top above the mouth of the cave and had them bound securely
with thick ropes under the ribs and at the stem and the stern. The boats
were then filled with as many men as they could hold and were lowered to
the cave with ropes. The men in the boats threw weapons and stones at
the heathens and forced them back from the wall. Sigurd and his men then
scrambled up the cliff, broke down the wall, and got into the cave. The
heathens retreated and the king had huge pieces of wood brought to the
cave-mouth where he built an immense bonfire and set it alight. When the
fire and smoke reached the heathens, some of them died and others
charged toward the Norsemen’s weapons; all of them were cut down or
burnt. The Norsemen took the largest amount of plunder they had got yet
in this campaign. As Halldor Skvaldri says:</p>
<p>The battle-bold</p>
<p>breaker of peace</p>
<p>set sail</p>
<p>for Formentera;</p>
<p>the band of black warriors</p>
<p>suffered sword</p>
<p>and fire, before falling,</p>
<p>enduring death.</p>
<p>And he says this too:</p>
<p>War-lord, you lowered</p>
<p>boats from above</p>
<p>did daring deeds</p>
<p>against the marauding Moors;</p>
<p>peerless prince,</p>
<p>you clambered courageously</p>
<p>up the cliff to the cave</p>
<p>with many men,</p>
<p>Thorarin Stuttfeld says further:</p>
<p>The war-wise prince</p>
<p>bade his men bring</p>
<p>two black boats,</p>
<p>and haul them up the hill;</p>
<p>rocking on their ropes,</p>
<p>the laden boats were lowered,</p>
<p>brought men to the mouth</p>
<p>of the cave in the cliff.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Then King Sigurd continued on his way until he came to the island
called Ibiza. He fought and won his seventh battle there. As Halldor
Skvaldri says:</li>
</ol>
<p>The famous lord with his fleet</p>
<p>—the shield-bearer with his ships—</p>
<p>came to Ibiza; keen was the glorious</p>
<p>prince for peace-breaking.</p>
<p>After that, he came to the island named Minorca where he fought and
won his eighth battle against heathens. As Halldor Skvaldri says:</p>
<p>He fought a further battle,</p>
<p>an eighth one after that;</p>
<p>on Minorca’s green grass.</p>
<p>lay arrows crimsoned in combat.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>In the spring, King Sigurd arrived in Sicily and stayed there for
a long while. At that time, Roger II [1095–1154] was duke of Sicily. He
gave King Sigurd a warm welcome and invited him to a banquet. King
Sigurd attended the feast with a large number of men and there was
splendid merry-making. Every day while the banquet lasted, Duke Roger
stood at the king’s table and served him. On the seventh day, however,
after everyone had washed, King Sigurd took Duke Roger by the hand, led
him up to the high seat and bestowed on him the title of king and the
right to be king over Sicily; before then it had been ruled by
earls.</p></li>
<li><p>Roger, king of Sicily, was a very powerful man. He conquered the
whole of Apulia and gained control of many large islands in the Greek
Sea; he became known as Roger the Mighty. His son William, king of
Sicily [1154–66], was at war with the emperor of Mikligard for a long
time. King William had three daughters but no son. He married one of his
daughters to the emperor Henry [Henry VI, 1165–97], the son of Emperor
Frederik [Barbarossa, 1122–90], and their son, Frederik [Frederick II,
1211–50], is now emperor of Rome. William’s second daughter married the
duke of Cyprus [?] and his third daughter married Margrit, the leader of
the corsairs. The emperor Henry killed both of them. The daughter of
King Roger of Sicily married Manuel, emperor of Mikligard [Manuel I
Komnenos, 1118–80], and their son was the emperor Kirjalax [Kurios
Alexius, Alexius II Komnenos, 1169–83]. [This genealogy contains
inaccuracies.]</p></li>
<li><p>In the summer, King Sigurd sailed across the Greek Sea to
Palestine. Then he rode to Jerusalem where he met Baldwin, the king of
Jerusalem [1058–1118]. Baldwin gave Sigurd a very warm welcome; he rode
with him to the River Jordan and back. Einar Skulason says:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The skald must not scant</p>
<p>his praises for the prince</p>
<p>whose sea-cold keel</p>
<p>sailed south to the Greek Sea;</p>
<p>our king came</p>
<p>to anchor at Acre;</p>
<p>all the prince’s people</p>
<p>made merry that morning.</p>
<p>Einar also says this:</p>
<p>The courageous king</p>
<p>journeyed to Jerusalem;</p>
<p>no nobler prince is known</p>
<p>under the high heavens;</p>
<p>the gracious gold-giver</p>
<p>with praiseworthy purpose</p>
<p>went to wash in the</p>
<p>pure water of wide Jordan.</p>
<p>King Sigurd stayed in Palestine for a long time during the autumn and
early winter.</p>
<ol start="11" type="1">
<li>King Baldwin held a splendid banquet for Sigurd and his large
following and presented Sigurd with many holy relics. A fragment was
taken from the true cross on the orders of the king and the patriarch,
both of whom swore on the holy relic that this wood came from the holy
cross on which God himself had suffered. This holy relic was given to
Sigurd on condition that he, along with twelve of his men, swore to do
everything in his power to spread Christianity and to establish an
archbishopric in his kingdom if he could. He swore, too, that the
fragment of the cross would be kept where King Olaf rested. Finally, he
swore to promote the payment of tithes and to pay them himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then King Sigurd returned to his ships at Acre. At that time, King
Baldwin was preparing his army for an expedition to a heathen town
called Saet [Sidon?] in Syria, and King Sigurd went on the expedition
with him. After a short siege, the heathens surrendered; the kings took
possession of the city, and their troops got the rest of the plunder.
King Sigurd turned over the whole of the city to King Baldwin. As
Halldor Skvaldri says:</p>
<p>Feeder of fierce wolves,</p>
<p>you took the town</p>
<p>—the home of heathens—</p>
<p>and, great-hearted, gave it away.</p>
<p>Einar Skulason also speaks of this;</p>
<p>The warrior will remember that</p>
<p>the Dales-men’s prince prevailed</p>
<p>at Saet, as catapults crashed</p>
<p>in a storm that shook the city;</p>
<p>the reddener of the raven’s beak [Sigurd]</p>
<p>brought down the mighty defenses</p>
<p>and swords were smeared with</p>
<p>blood as the bold prince triumphed.</p>
<p>Then King Sigurd returned to his ships and got ready to leave
Palestine. They sailed north as far as the island called Cyprus and
stayed there for a time. Next, he sailed to Greece and anchored off Cape
Malea with his whole fleet. He lay there for two weeks. Each day there
was a fine fresh wind blowing north over the sea, but he was waiting for
a good cross-wind so that he could travel with his sails spread fore and
aft, since all his sails had inset panels of costly material both front
and back. This was so that no one—neither the men in the bow nor those
in the stern—would have to look at a plain sail.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>When King Sigurd sailed into Mikligard [Constantinople], he kept
close to the shore. The coast was lined with towns, castles, and
villages, one next to the other without a break. Offshore his curving
sails could be seen crowded together without a gap as if they formed a
single structure. The whole population was outdoors to see King Sigurd
sailing by. The Emperor Kirjalax had heard of King Sigurd’s expedition
and had given orders for the opening of the gate known in Mikligard as
the Golden Gate. This gate is used by the emperor when he has been away
from Mikligard for a long time and has won a great victory. The emperor
had all the streets of the town spread with costly material between the
Golden Gate and the Blachernae district, where the emperor has his
finest palace.</li>
</ol>
<p>King Sigurd told his men that they should ride proudly through the
city and not show the slightest astonishment at the novel things they
were seeing. And that is what they did. King Sigurd and his men rode
with great pomp into Mikligard all the way to the most splendid of the
royal palaces, where everything had been prepared for their reception.
After King Sigurd had stayed at Mikligard for some time, the emperor
Kirjalax sent messengers to ask him what he would prefer: to receive six
ship-pounds of gold, or to have the emperor hold games for him at the
Hippodrome. King Sigurd opted for the games and the messengers told him
that the games would cost the emperor just as much as the value of the
gold that had been offered.</p>
<p>The emperor arranged for the games in the customary manner. He and
the empress held the games jointly, and their men competed against one
another in everything. On this occasion, the games turned out better for
the emperor than for the empress. The Greeks say that when the emperor
wins more games in the Hippodrome than the empress, then he will be
victorious if he goes on campaign.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>After that, King Sigurd got ready for his journey home. He gave all
his ships to the emperor, and the gilded figureheads that had decorated
the king’s ship were installed in Saint Peter’s Church. The emperor
Kirjalax gave King Sigurd a great many horses and provided him with
guides for his journey through the empire. Then King Sigurd left
Mikligard, but many of his men stayed behind and entered military
service.</li>
</ol>
<p>King Sigurd traveled through Bulgaria first and then through Hungary,
Pannonia [part of Hungary], Schwaben, and Bavaria. There he met the
Roman emperor, Lothar [Lothar III, 1075–1137, then still duke of
Saxony], who made him very welcome and provided him with men to guide
him through the entire kingdom. Lothar also set up markets so that
Sigurd and his men could buy whatever they needed. At midsummer, King
Sigurd reached Schleswig in Denmark, and Earl Eilif gave him a splendid
banquet.</p>
<p>In Hedeby, he met King Nikolas of Denmark [1064–1134], who welcomed
him and accompanied him north to Jutland. There he gave him a fully
equipped ship on which he sailed to Norway. King Sigurd arrived back in
his kingdom to a joyful reception. It was the general opinion that there
had never before been a more splendid expedition from Norway than this
one. King Sigurd was twenty years old at this time and had spent three
years on the journey. His brother Olaf was twelve years of age.</p>
<ol start="99" type="1">
<li>The Journey of abbot Nikolas Bergsson from Iceland to Jerusalem</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometime in the early 1150s the Icelander Nikolas Bergsson, abbot of
the Benedictine monastery of Thvera in northern Iceland, made a
pilgrimage to Rome and the Holy Land. His trip is detailed in a text
called the Leiðarvísir (“Guide”), the only known complete vernacular
pilgrim itinerary from medieval Iceland, which survives in late medieval
manuscripts. Abbot Nikolas provides a detailed itinerary with over 200
place-names, and the narrative is enlivened with anecdotes and details
about the places he visited or heard about. This extract accompanies the
abbot as far as northern Italy and rejoins him in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Alfraeði íslenzk, ed. Kristian
Kålund, 3 vols., Samfund til Udgivelse af gammel nordisk Litteratur
(Copenhagen, 1908–18), vol. 1, pp. 12–23.</p>
<p>It is said that it takes seven days to sail right around Iceland if
there is a favorable wind and if it shifts as necessary, for winds from
more than one direction are needed to circumnavigate Iceland. The
sailing distance between Iceland and Norway is also reckoned to be seven
days.</p>
<p>From Norway, the first leg of the journey [to Rome and Palestine] is
to Aalborg in Denmark. Pilgrims to Rome say that it takes a two-day
journey to get from Aalborg to Viborg and then a week to get from Viborg
to Hedeby, which is close to Schleswig. After that it takes another day
to reach the River Eider, where the borders of Denmark, Holstein,
Saxland [Germany], and Wendland meet. Itzehoe in Holstein is a day’s
journey away.</p>
<p>The route continues across the River Elbe to Stade in Germany. The
German people are very courtly in their behavior, and are much imitated
by Norsemen. St. Mary’s Church in Stade is an episcopal seat. From
Stade, it is a two-day journey to Verden and a short distance further to
Nienburg. Next comes Minden, where there is a cathedral dedicated to
Saint Peter. Here the dialects change [possibly from one Low German
dialect to another].</p>
<p>From Minden it is a two-day journey to Paderborn. Here, there is an
episcopal seat at the church of St. Liborius, where the saint himself
rests. Mainz is four days further on, and between Paderborn and Mainz is
a town called Horhausen and another called Kilianstädten [?]; this is
the location of Gnitaheid where Sigurd killed Fafnir.</p>
<p>Another route may be taken from Stade. This one heads eastward
through Germany to Harsefeld, and from there to Walsrode and Hannover.
It then continues to Hildesheim, where there is a cathedral containing
the remains of Saint Gothard. The next town on the route is Gandersheim,
followed by Fritzlar. Then comes Arnsburg, which is not far from Mainz,
mentioned in the first route.</p>
<p>These two popular routes, which meet at Mainz, are the ones used by
Norsemen and by most other travelers. But there is also another route to
Rome from Norway…. [gap in the manuscript] This one goes to Deventer or
Utrecht where travellers take up the scrip and staff and receive a
blessing for their journey to Rome.</p>
<p>From Utrecht, it is one day’s journey to Cologne, where St. Peter’s
Church is the cathedral of the archbishopric. It is the duty of the
bishop of Cologne to consecrate the emperor in the church at Aachen.
From Cologne it takes three days of travel along the Rhine to reach
Mainz, where the archbishop’s cathedral is the Church of Saints Peter
and Paul. From there it is a one-day journey to Spiers, with its
cathedral, St. Mary’s Church. Then it takes three days to reach Selz and
one more to reach Strassburg, where the bishop’s seat is St. Mary’s
Church. From there it is three days to Basle. Here, the route turns away
from the Rhine and heads for Solothurn, a one-day journey. Then it is
another day’s travel to Wiflisburg, which was a large town until the
sons of Ragnar Hairy-Breeches destroyed it; now it is a small town.
After that it is a day’s journey to Vevay which stands beside Martin’s
Lake [Lake Geneva].</p>
<p>This is the junction of all the routes taken by everyone who crosses
the Alps for the south: Franks, Flemings, French, Angles, Saxons
[probably Germans], and Norsemen. From Vevay, it takes a day to get to
Saint-Maurice, where Saint Maurice and his entire army of 6,666 men lie
buried. The castle of St. Pierre is also located here. From
Saint-Maurice the route leads in two days to the hospice of St. Bernard,
which is situated in the mountains. Also up in the Alps is the hospice
of St. Peter, where in summer, on the Feast of Saint Olaf [29 July], the
rocks are often snow-covered and the lake iced over.</p>
<p>To the south of the Alps is Etroubles. Then comes Aosta, a fine city
with a cathedral called the church of St. Ursus, where Saint Ursus is
buried. Next is Pont St. Martin and, after that, Ivrea which is a
two-day journey from Aosta. A day later, the route reaches Vercelli,
where Saint Eusebius lies in the cathedral that bears his name. Milan is
a day’s journey to the east of the road for Rome and, if you keep
heading for Rome, a day will get you to Pavia, where St. Syrus’ Church
is located. There is an imperial throne in this church, and the saint is
buried there too. Pavia is also the town where Bishop Martin grew up; he
has an important church there. A day further on is Piacenza, with its
cathedral, St. Mary’s Church. Between Pavia and Piacenza flows a wide
river called the Po, and it is here that those who travel from Saint
Gilles-du-Gard join the route. From Piacenza, it is a day’s travel south
to Borgo San Donnino, and between these two towns is Eirik’s hospice
[Eirik I, king of Denmark, ca 1060–1103]. Then comes the river Taro
which is wide and clear. It is never polluted or contaminated because
all the dirt that is thrown into it sinks immediately to the bottom.
South of this is Borgo di Val di Taro.</p>
<p>From there, the route crosses the mountains known as the Appenines.
Lombardy is the name of the region lying to the south of the Appenines
and stretching north to the Alps. The western end of the Alps reaches
the sea [Gulf of Genoa] in the Stura region, while the eastern end
extends to the Venetian Lagoons. In the Appenines, are the towns of
Santa Croce, Villa Franca, and Pontremoli, and it is a day’s journey
from there to the Guild of Saint Mary. Then comes the town of Luni, with
the nearby Sands of Luni [La Lunigiana]. These pleasant sands are ten
miles across, and the towns along them have a sweeping view. Between
Santa Maria del Suorte and Luni are the towns of San Steffano and
Sarzana. Some people claim that the Sands of Luni are the location of
the snake pit into which Gunnar was thrown. To the south is Monte
Capriglia.</p>
<p>The roads from Spain and Santiago di Compostella meet at Luni, and
Lucca is a day’s journey away. The cathedral there, St. Mary’s Church,
contains the crucifix that Nicodemus had made in the likeness of God
himself. This crucifix has spoken twice: once to have a poor man
provided with shoes, and the other time, to testify on behalf of a man
who had been slandered. South of Lucca is the town called Pisa where
merchants bring dromonds from Greece and Sicily, and from Egypt, Syria,
and Africa. To the south of Pisa is the town of Arnblack [Arno
Nero?].</p>
<p>After that comes the hospice of Matilda [countess of Tuscany,
d. 1115], which she established in fulfillment of a vow made at the
monastery of Monte Cassino. Every traveler has the right to stay there
overnight. Next is Sanctinusborg [San Gimignano ?], followed by Borgo
Martini [Poggibonsi ?]. Then the route reaches the fine, large town of
Siena, which has a cathedral, the Church of St. Mary. The women of Siena
are very beautiful. It takes three days to get from Siena to Lucca, one
day to get from Siena to San Quirico, and two days to get from Siena to
Acquapendente. The route crosses a mountain called Montichielli, and on
this mountain is a castle called Mala Mulier [wicked woman], or ‘illa
kona’ in our language [possibly in error for illicini, a local
placename]. The people here are very wicked. To the south of
Montichielli is Acquapendente. Everything from here as far north as the
Appenines is called Ruscia [Tuscia?].</p>
<p>Twelve miles from Acquapendente is the town of St. Christina
[Bolsena] where the saint herself lies, and where her footprints are
visible on the surface of a rock. Eight miles from here is Borgo San
Flaviano [Montefiascone], and a day further on is Viterbo where the
Baths of Theodoric are located. From here, it is ten miles to Sutri the
larger which is a day’s journey from Sutri the smaller. This latter town
is near Monte Mario, just to the north of Rome…. [Nikolas’s description
of Rome and southern Italy is omitted.]</p>
<p>It is not far from there [Myra, a town in Turkey] to Cape Gelidonya
in Turkey and from there it is a two-day sea-voyage to Cyprus. On the
way is the Bay of Antalya, which Norsemen call Atalsfjord and Greeks
call the Gulf of Satalie. On Cyprus is a town called Beffa [Paphos],
where there is an outpost of the Varangian guard. Eirik Sveinsson died
here. He was king of the Danes [r. 1095–1103], and brother of Saint
Knut. It was Eirik who endowed Lucca so that Danish speakers could have
wine to drink without payment. He also founded a hospice eight miles to
the south of Piacenza where food is given to all comers. It was he who
prevailed on Pope Paschal II to move the archbishopric from Germany to
Denmark.</p>
<p>From Cyprus it is a two-day sail to Acre, which is in the land of
Jerusalem [Palestine]. Next is Capharnaum [Kones], formerly called
Ptolemais; then come Caesarea [Qesari] and Jaffa. Jaffa was
Christianized by King Baldwin of Palestine [r. 1100–18] and Sigurd
Magnusson, king of Norway [r. 1103–30]. Next is Ascalon which is in the
land of the Saracens; it is heathen. Eastward from Acre are Tyre, Sidon,
Tripoli, and Latakia. Then comes the mouth of the gulf which we call the
Bay of Antioch. The town of Antioch stands at the head of the gulf, and
it was there that Saint Peter established his archi-episcopal throne.
All these towns are in Syria.</p>
<p>The district of Galilee stretches inland from Acre. In this region is
Mount Thabor, where Moses and Elijah revealed themselves to the
apostles. Next is Nazareth where the Angel Gabriel appeared to Mary and
where Christ was brought up for twenty-three years. After this comes the
town of Genin which was formerly part of Samaria. A holy relic of John
the Baptist was found there in the Castle of St. John. Nearby is Jacob’s
Well, where Christ asked the woman to give him a drink. Then comes
Nablus, a large town, and after that Casal [?] and Magdala [?].</p>
<p>From there, the route leads to Jerusalem, the most wonderful city in
the world. Its praises are sung throughout Christendom, because it is
here that the important memorials of Christ’s passion can be seen. The
church which contains Christ’s grave is here. It is also the place where
the Lord’s cross stood, and where Christ’s blood can still be seen on a
rock, as if it had been newly shed. It will remain like this until
doomsday. Here, too, on Easter Saturday, heavenly light is bestowed on
men [the miracle of Holy Fire]. This church, which is at the centre of
the world, is called the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. In it, there is
an opening above the tomb and, on the feast of Saint John, the sun
shines straight down through this opening from the heavens above. The
Hospice of Saint John the Baptist is here—it is the most splendid in the
world—and here, too, are the Tower of David, the Temple of the Lord
[Dome of the Rock], and the Temple of Solomon.</p>
<p>Southwest of Jerusalem is Mount Sion where the Holy Spirit visited
the Apostles, and where Christ ate on the evening of Maundy Thursday
[Last Supper]. The table at which he ate still stands there. Four miles
to the south is Bethlehem, a pretty little town, in which Christ was
born, and not far from there is Bethany, where Christ raised Lazarus
from the dead. Southeast of Jerusalem is a lake called the Dead Sea in
which God submerged two cities: Sodom on one side and Gomorra on the
other. The River Jordan flows through the Dead Sea, but does not mix
with the salt-water because the Jordan is the holiest of rivers.</p>
<p>To the east of the city is the Mount of Olives where Christ ascended
to heaven. Between Jerusalem and the Mount of Olives is the valley of
Jehosaphat, where the grave of the Virgin Mary is located. A good way
off from here is Mount Quarantia where Christ fasted and was tempted by
the devil. After that comes Abraham’s Castle, where Jericho once stood,
near the Plains of Abraham. Not far from there is the Jordan, where
Christ was baptized. It flows from the northeast to the southwest
[actually north-south]. On the far side of the Jordan is Arabia, and on
this side is the region of Palestine called Syria. On the river bank
stands a little chapel, built to mark the place where Christ removed his
clothes.</p>
<p>Out there by the Jordan, if a man lies down on level ground, raises
his knee, rests his fist on it, and holds his thumb straight up from his
fist, then the Pole Star is visible at the tip of his thumb and no
higher.</p>
<p>This itinerary and list of towns, with all the other information, was
written down at the dictation of Abbot Nicholas, a wise and famous man.
He has a good memory and extensive learning. He is also experienced and
truthful. The narrative ends here.</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen</p>
<hr />
<p>State-Building at Home and Abroad</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Viking Age, Scandinavia was dominated by
numerous small kingdoms or chiefdoms, although by the last period of the
Scandinavian Iron Age (roughly 600–800) fairly powerful regional
kingdoms had started to emerge around Lake Mälaren in Sweden, in Jutland
in Denmark, and in Vestfold in Norway. As the Viking Age progressed,
these nascent kingdoms were forged into the medieval states of Denmark,
Norway, and Sweden. We know most about state-building in Denmark, where
by about 800 CE the Danes had already created a kingdom that embraced
most of modern Denmark and parts of southern Sweden and the Vestfold
region of Norway. Early ninth-century Norway was divided into a number
of chiefdoms and regions, and parts of southern Norway (like Vestfold)
were under the control of Danish rulers. The medieval Icelandic saga
tradition associates the unification of Norway with the Vestfold king
Harald Finehair at the end of the ninth and beginning of the tenth
century. For the most part, the kings who unified their kingdoms were
also Christian and were, ostensibly at least, responsible for converting
(or beginning the conversion of) their respective peoples. In Norway,
Christianization had little place, so far as we can tell, in Harald
Finehair’s agenda, but Harald’s role in state-building there is
downplayed by modern scholars, who point instead to the Christianizing
kings Olaf Tryggvason and Olaf Haraldsson (Saint Olaf) as being
responsible for creating a strong unitary kingship. The fact that these
so-called Vikings for Christ were also state-builders is not a
coincidence, and they, like Harald Bluetooth and others, recognized the
potential of Christianity, in terms of both doctrine and church
organization, as a means to strengthen kingship and promote unity. For
this reason the documents in this chapter may also be considered in
light of the preceding chapter dealing with the conversion to
Christianity.</p>
<p>In this period, much less is known about Sweden, which was inhabited
by two peoples, the Svear and the Götar. However, by the end of the
tenth and the start of the eleventh century one king was ruling both
people. For a relatively brief period in the eleventh and twelfth
centuries, loose “Viking empires” emerged in the North Sea and Irish
Sea. Most notably, King Knut the Great (d. 1035), a grandson of Harald
Bluetooth, ruled England, Denmark, Norway, and perhaps part of Sweden,
while the powerful earls of Orkney, though technically subject to
Norway, were formidable rulers in their own right whose authority
embraced the Shetland and Orkney islands as well as the northern
mainland of Scotland, the Hebrides, and the Isle of Man.</p>
