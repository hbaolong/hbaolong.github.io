<h4 id="the-battle-of-stamford-bridge-1066-aaaaaaaa">108. The Battle of
Stamford Bridge, 1066 AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>When King Edward the Confessor of England died without heirs in
January of 1066, three contenders emerged for his throne: Harold
Godwinsson, earl of Wessex; William, duke of Normandy; and Harald
Sigurdarson, king of Norway. The English chose Harold Godwinsson as
king, but William and Harald began preparations to take the throne by
force. Harald of Norway struck first, landing in the north of England
with 300 ships, defeating the English at Fulford Gate and capturing York
on 20 September. Five days later, Harold Godwinsson surprised Harald and
his Scandinavians at Stamford Bridge, near York, and inflicted a
crushing defeat upon them. The death of King Harald Sigurdarson of
Norway at Stamford Bridge is often seen as symbolizing the end of the
Viking Age. It was not the last major Viking expedition overseas, but it
was the end of Viking influence in England and was the last Viking
expedition with a real chance of success. From The Saga of Harald
Sigurdarson.</p>
<p>Source: trans A.A. Somerville from Snorri Sturluson, Haralds saga
Sigurðarsonar, in Heimskringla, ed. Bjarni Aðalbjarnarson, Íslenzk
fornrit XXVI–XXVIII (Reykjavík, 2002), vol. 3, pp. 178–92.</p>
<ol start="83" type="1">
<li>When his preparations were complete and the wind was favorable, King
Harald put to sea. He himself landed in the Shetlands, but some of his
forces went straight to the Orkneys. After a short stay, Harald sailed
on to the Orkneys. When he left there, he had a large force with him,
including the earls Pal and Erlend, the sons of Earl Thorfinn. However,
he left behind his queen, Elizabeth, and their daughters, Maria and
Ingigerd.</li>
</ol>
<p>He sailed south along the coast of Scotland and England and landed at
a place called Cleveland, where he went ashore. He began raiding
immediately and subdued the whole area without meeting any resistance.
Then King Harald made for Scarborough and fought with the townsmen. He
climbed the hill above the town, where he built a bonfire, and set it
alight. When the fire was fully ablaze, they used long forks to hurl the
burning wood down onto the town. House after house burst into flames
until the whole town was engulfed. The Norsemen killed many people and
made off with all the plunder they could get hold of. The English had no
choice, if they wanted to escape with their lives, but to submit to King
Harald, and so he subjugated the country wherever he went.</p>
<p>Then Harald headed south along the coast with his entire force and
landed near Holderness where an English host had gathered against him.
King Harald engaged them in battle and won.</p>
<ol start="84" type="1">
<li><p>Next, King Harald sailed up the River Humber and moored there,
close to land. At that time, Earl Morcar and his brother, Earl Waltheow,
were at York with a large army. When the earls’ army came down to attack
King Harald, he was at anchor in the River Ouse. He came ashore and
began drawing up his forces. One wing of his army extended down to the
river bank, while the other stretched inland to a dyke, where there was
a broad marsh that was deep and full of water. The earls had their men
advance slowly down the river, in a solid mass. The king’s standard was
beside the river where his line was thickest and the thinnest part of
the line was at the dyke where the least reliable men were stationed. It
was there, along the dyke, that the earls launched their attack. The
Norse wing at the dyke gave way, and the English followed them, thinking
that the Norsemen would run away. Morcar’s standard was in the
lead.</p></li>
<li><p>When King Harald saw that a host of Englishmen had advanced along
the dyke and was now opposite them, he had the trumpet sounded and urged
on his army energetically. Then, with his standard, Land-Ravager,
carried in front of him, Harald went on the offensive so fiercely that
the enemy fell back in disarray. Many of the earls’ men were
slaughtered. The rest of the English troops quickly turned and fled,
some up the river and some down. Most of them, however, jumped into the
marsh, where the dead lay so closely packed that the Norsemen could
cross the marsh without getting their feet wet. Earl Morcar perished
there. Stein Herdisarson says this:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>People perished in the river,</p>
<p>soldiers sank and drowned;</p>
<p>many of young Morcar’s</p>
<p>finest warriors fell by his side.</p>
<p>The powerful Prince Olaf</p>
<p>drove foes to flight;</p>
<p>they ran from the brave ruler.</p>
<p>Stein Herdisarson composed this poem in honor of King Harald’s son,
Olaf. We are told in the poem that Olaf was with his father in this
battle. We hear about the same events in Harald’s Stanzas:</p>
<p>The fallen lay</p>
<p>in the fen,</p>
<p>Waltheow’s warriors</p>
<p>cut down by weapons;</p>
<p>and so the Norse band</p>
<p>keen in battle,</p>
<p>could cross the fen,</p>
<p>on a bridge of corpses.</p>
<p>Earl Waltheow and the rest of the survivors fled to the city of York.
There had been terrible slaughter in the battle, which took place on the
Wednesday before St. Matthew’s Day [21 September].</p>
<ol start="86" type="1">
<li>As soon as King Harald arrived in England, Earl Tostig [Harold
Godwinsson’s brother] came north from Flanders to join him, and so the
earl took part in all these battles. As Tostig had foretold when he and
Harald had met previously, many people joined their ranks in England.
These were Tostig’s relatives and friends, and they reinforced King
Harald’s army considerably. After this battle, the entire population of
the neighboring districts submitted to King Harald, except for a few who
fled.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then Harald set off to capture York, positioning his army at Stamford
Bridge. Since Harald had won such a great victory against powerful
leaders and overwhelming opposition, the English were afraid and had
little hope of resisting him. Accordingly, the townspeople decided to
send a message to King Harald, offering to place themselves and their
city in his hands. An agreement was reached, and King Harald and his
entire army advanced toward the city on the Sunday. King Harald held a
meeting outside the city, which both the king’s men and the townsmen
attended. The townspeople agreed to submit to King Harald and gave him
the sons of the leading men of the town as hostages—Earl Tostig knew all
the townspeople. In the evening, King Harald went down to his ships,
very pleased with his easy victory. It had been arranged that there
would be a meeting in the town early on Monday morning so that Harald
could appoint governors for the city and distribute land and
privileges.</p>
<p>That same evening after sunset, King Harold Godwinsson [king of
England] entered York from the south with an overwhelming army; he rode
into the town with the consent and approval of all the inhabitants. The
city gates were closed and so were all the roads so that the Norsemen
would not get word that the English army was in the city. The army
stayed there overnight.</p>
<ol start="87" type="1">
<li>After breakfast on Monday morning, Harald Sigurdarson had the
trumpet sounded for disembarking. He got the army ready and divided it
into two parties, one of which was to go to the city while the other
stayed behind with the ships. In each company, two out of every three
men went ashore, and the third remained behind. Earl Tostig got ready to
accompany King Harald ashore with his division. Those left to guard the
ships were: Olaf, the king’s son, Pal and Erlend, the earls of Orkney,
and Eystein Orri, the son of Thorberg Arnason, who was the noblest of
all the landed-men and dearest to the king. King Harald had promised him
his daughter Maria in marriage.</li>
</ol>
<p>As the weather was remarkably fine and the sunshine was hot, the men
left their coats of mail behind, and went ashore taking only their
shields, helmets, halberds, and swords. Many also had bows and arrows;
they were all very cheerful.</p>
<p>But, as they approached the city, a large force came riding toward
them. They saw the dust-cloud raised by the horses’ hooves and, under
it, they saw fine shields and bright chain mail. Then King Harald
brought his army to a halt and summoned Earl Tostig to his side. The
king asked him what army this could be. The earl answered that it was
probably a hostile army, although it could be some of his relatives
seeking mercy and friendship from the king, in return for their loyalty
and support. Harald declared that they had better stay put until they
could get some information about the other army; they did so. The army
loomed larger the nearer it came, its weapons glittering like broken
ice.</p>
<ol start="88" type="1">
<li>Then King Harald Sigurdarson spoke. “We must now come up with a
good, workable plan,” he said, “for there’s no doubt that these are
hostile forces, and that the king himself is with them.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“The first thing to do,” replied Earl Tostig, “is to turn back to our
ships as quickly as possible, and pick up the rest of our army and
weapons. Then we’ll give the enemy as hot a reception as we can, or
we’ll take shelter on our ships where the horsemen won’t be able to get
at us.”</p>
<p>“I have a different idea,” answered King Harald. “Let’s put three
brave warriors on our fastest horses and have them ride post haste to
our men and tell them to come and help us right away. For the Englishmen
must expect a fierce fight, before we admit defeat.”</p>
<p>The earl responded that the king must decide this as he did
everything else, and added that he himself had no wish to flee. Then
King Harald had his standard, Land-Ravager, raised. It was carried by a
man called Frirek.</p>
<ol start="89" type="1">
<li>King Harald drew up his army in a long, thin line and then drew the
wings back until they met to form a large circle with an even depth all
the way round. The men stood with their shields interlocking and inside
the circle was the king’s standard and his retinue of hand-picked men.
Earl Tostig and his troops were also positioned inside the circle and he
had his own standard. The king had chosen this formation because he knew
that the horsemen usually charged up in small groups and then turned
back immediately. The king now ordered both his own men and the earl’s
men to intervene wherever they were most needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>“And our bowmen will go with us,” said Harald. “If the enemy charge
us, the men standing in the front rank of the circle will anchor their
spear shafts in the ground and direct the points at the chests of the
horsemen; the men in the second rank will aim for the chests of their
horses.”</p>
<ol start="90" type="1">
<li>King Harold Godwinsson had arrived there with a very large army of
both horsemen and foot-soldiers. King Harald Sigurdarson then rode
around his army inspecting their formation. He was mounted on a black
horse with a white flash on its forehead. The horse lost its footing and
the king fell off, but he got up quickly and said, “A fall is good luck
for a journey.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Then King Harold of England asked the Norsemen who were with him, “Do
you recognize the big man who fell off his horse, the one with the black
tunic and fine helmet?”</p>
<p>“That’s the king himself,” they answered.</p>
<p>“He’s a tall, powerful-looking man,” said the King of England, “but
it looks as if his luck has deserted him.”</p>
<ol start="91" type="1">
<li>Twenty of the English housekarls [king’s bodyguard] rode toward the
Norse army. Both the men and their horses were armored. One of the
horsemen said, “Is Earl Tostig in this army?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Yes, you’ll find him here,” replied Tostig. “There’s no secret about
that.”</p>
<p>Then one of the riders said, “Your brother, King Harold, sends his
greetings and this message: he is willing to make peace with you and
give you the whole of Northumberland; he would rather give you a third
of his kingdom than have you refuse to side with him.”</p>
<p>“That’s slightly different from the hostility and disgrace he offered
me in the winter,” replied the earl. “If this had been on offer then,
many a man now dead would still be alive, and the kingdom of England
would be more secure. If I accept this deal, what will he offer King
Harald Sigurdarson for his pains?”</p>
<p>“He did say something about how much of England he would give King
Harald,” replied the horseman. “Seven feet of English earth, or a bit
more, since he’s taller than other men.”</p>
<p>“Go and tell King Harold to get ready for battle,” said the earl.
“Norsemen will never be able to say that Earl Tostig deserted Harald
Sigurdarson and joined his enemies when he came west to fight here in
England. We are all determined to die with honor, or to conquer
England.” With that, the horsemen rode away.</p>
<p>“Who was that well-spoken man?” King Harald Sigurdarson asked the
earl.</p>
<p>“That was King Harold Godwinsson,” replied Earl Tostig.</p>
<p>“You kept that fact from me for too long,” said the king. “Having
come so close to our army, this Harold should now be beyond talking
about the deaths of our men.”</p>
<p>“True, my lord,” replied Tostig. “He acted incautiously for a chief,
and it might have turned out as you say. I saw that he wanted to offer
me peace and great power; but I would have been his killer if I had
given away his name, and I would rather he killed me than I killed
him.”</p>
<p>“He was a small man,” said King Harald to his men, “but he stood
proudly in his stirrups.”</p>
<p>People say that King Harald Sigurdarson recited this poem:</p>
<p>Let’s advance</p>
<p>In battle array</p>
<p>Without body-armor</p>
<p>Against blue-edged swords.</p>
<p>Helmets shine, but</p>
<p>I don’t have a mail-shirt;</p>
<p>Our armor lies</p>
<p>Useless at the ships.</p>
<p>His mail coat was called Emma. It was so long that it hung to the
middle of his calf and so strong that no weapon had ever pierced it.
“That was a terrible poem,” said King Harald. “I must compose a better
one.” Then he recited this:</p>
<p>The trust-worthy woman</p>
<p>bade us in battle</p>
<p>not to cower behind curved shields</p>
<p>fearing the din of the fight.</p>
<p>She bade me bear</p>
<p>my head high</p>
<p>in the brunt of battle,</p>
<p>where sword shatters skull.</p>
<p>Then Thjodolf recited:</p>
<p>Though our prince himself perish,</p>
<p>—that will be as God wills—</p>
<p>I shall not be shaken,</p>
<p>shall not abandon his young heirs;</p>
<p>the sun does not shine</p>
<p>on two finer future kings;</p>
<p>these avenging sons of strong-willed</p>
<p>Harald are two young hawks.</p>
<ol start="92" type="1">
<li>The battle began with an English cavalry charge on the Norsemen, who
resisted strongly. It wasn’t easy for the English to charge directly at
the Norsemen because of the hail of weapons, so they rode around them
instead. At first, there was no close fighting. As long as the Norsemen
held their formation, the English cavalry just charged up fiercely and
turned back immediately since they could make no inroads. When the
Norsemen saw that the charges were ineffectual, they went on the attack
and tried to put the English to flight. However, as soon as the Norsemen
broke their shield wall, the English charged them from all sides hurling
spears and other missiles at them. When Harald Sigurdarson saw what was
happening, he hurried to where the fighting was fiercest. Many men died
on both sides in the bitter fight that followed. King Harald Sigurdarson
became so enraged that he ran out in front of his troops and began
laying about him with both hands. Neither helmet nor mail shirt was
protection against him, and all those nearest him fled. At that moment,
the English were on the verge of running away. Arnor Jarlaskald [Earls’
poet] says this:</li>
</ol>
<p>The daring prince did not</p>
<p>wear war-gear,</p>
<p>yet the battle-bold king</p>
<p>did not tremble in terror.</p>
<p>The soldiers saw</p>
<p>the blood-stained sword</p>
<p>of their powerful prince</p>
<p>killing King Harold’s men.</p>
<p>King Harald Sigurdarson was struck in the throat by an arrow, and
that was his death-wound. He fell, and all the men who had advanced with
him were killed too, except for the men who retreated with the standard.
Once again there was heavy fighting. Then Earl Tostig took up position
under the king’s standard, and there was a long pause in the battle
while both sides drew up their lines for a second time. Thjodolf
said:</p>
<p>Men paid a terrible price.</p>
<p>And now the troops were trapped.</p>
<p>King Harald had caused them</p>
<p>to make a meaningless journey west.</p>
<p>The much praised prince</p>
<p>lost his life,</p>
<p>and the death of the daring lord</p>
<p>left his people in peril.</p>
<p>Before the battle began again, King Harold Godwinsson offered peace
to Tostig, his brother, and to all the other survivors of the Norse
army, but the Norsemen cried out as one man that they would all fall
dead beside one another before they would accept quarter from
Englishmen. Then they raised a war-cry, and the battle started all over
again. Arnor Jarlaskald says:</p>
<p>Ill luck led to</p>
<p>the fierce king’s fall.</p>
<p>Gilded spear-points did not spare</p>
<p>the lord of our land.</p>
<p>Not tempted by a truce,</p>
<p>all the army</p>
<p>of the courageous king</p>
<p>chose to perish by their prince.</p>
<ol start="93" type="1">
<li>At that moment, Eystein Orri came up from the ships with his men;
they were wearing their chain mail. Then Eystein seized the king’s
standard, Land-Ravager, and the third and fiercest phase of the battle
began. Many Englishmen died in the heavy fighting and the others were on
the verge of running away. This fight was called Orri’s Attack. Eystein
and his men had come from the ships with such haste that they were
exhausted before the battle began and were scarcely fit to fight.
Afterwards, though, they fought with such fury that they didn’t even
protect themselves with their shields as long as they could stand
upright. Finally, they threw off their chain-mail, making it easy for
the English to find their vulnerable spots. Some simply collapsed with
the exertion and died unwounded. By late in the day, most of the
Norwegian leaders were dead. As might be expected, not everyone shared
the same fate: many fled and many were lucky enough to escape in a
variety of different ways. The evening was dark before the slaughter was
completely over.</li>
