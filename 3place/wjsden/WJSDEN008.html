<h4 id="hoskuld-buys-a-slave">5. Hoskuld Buys A Slave</h4>
<p>The Saga of the People of Laxdale traces the fortunes of the settlers
in this region of northwest Iceland and their descendants from the late
ninth to the early eleventh century. In this episode, Hoskuld
Dala-Kollsson—a godi, or chieftain, in the district—is away from home,
in Norway, and casually buys an Irish slave, Melkorka, and takes her as
his concubine.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 22–25.</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>Early in the summer, King Hakon [King Hakon I, the Good, of Norway,
ca 920–961] went on a naval expedition east to the Brenney Isles. There,
as required by law, an assembly was held every third summer to confirm
the peace throughout the land. These meetings were arranged among kings
in order to settle those disputes which only they could judge. Attending
the assembly was seen as a holiday because men came to it from almost
every country in the known world. Hoskuld wanted to attend the assembly
since he had not visited the king that winter, so he too launched his
ship.</li>
</ol>
<p>A fair was held at the same time, and the assembly was very crowded.
There was plenty of entertainment—drinking, games, and all sorts of
amusements—but nothing of particular importance took place. Hoskuld met
many of his relatives from Denmark there.</p>
<p>One day, when Hoskuld was on his way to enjoy himself with some
companions, he noticed a splendid tent, pitched at a distance from the
other booths. Hoskuld walked over and entered the tent; there, in front
of him, sat a well-dressed man wearing a Russian hat. Hoskuld asked his
name, and he replied that he was called Gilli. “But many people
recognize me by my nickname,” he said. “I’m called Gilli the
Russian.”</p>
<p>Hoskuld replied that he had often heard him spoken of as the
wealthiest man who had ever belonged to the guild of merchants. “I
expect you can sell us anything we want to buy,” said Hoskuld.</p>
<p>Gilli asked what he and his companions had in mind. Hoskuld replied
that he wanted to buy a slave-woman, “if you have any to sell, that
is.”</p>
<p>“You thought you’d catch me out by asking for something you didn’t
expect me to have,” replied Gilli. “But whether you’re right or not is
another matter.”</p>
<p>Hoskuld noticed that there was a curtain drawn across the booth, and
when Gilli raised the curtain Hoskuld saw twelve women sitting behind
it. Gilli invited Hoskuld to go in and take a look, to see if he wanted
to buy one of these women. Hoskuld did so. The women were sitting in a
row across the booth and Hoskuld scrutinized them carefully. He noticed
that one woman was sitting on her own, close to the edge of the tent.
She was poorly dressed, but, from what he could see of her, Hoskuld
thought she was beautiful.</p>
<p>“How much would you want for this woman if I decided to buy her?”
asked Hoskuld. “She would cost you three marks of silver,” answered
Gilli.</p>
<p>“I would say you’re charging rather a high price for this servant,”
said Hoskuld. “You could get three for that price.”</p>
<p>“You’re right,” answered Gilli. “I do value her more highly than the
rest. Choose one of the eleven others and you can have her for a mark of
silver; I’ll hang on to this one.”</p>
<p>“First I’ll have to figure out how much silver I have in this purse
at my belt,” said Hoskuld. He asked Gilli to fetch his scales while he
looked into his purse.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to defraud you, Hoskuld,” said Gilli. “This woman has
a defect, and I want you to know about it before we strike a
bargain.”</p>
<p>Hoskuld asked what it was. “The woman is mute,” replied Gilli. “I’ve
tried many different ways of making her speak, but I’ve never managed to
get a word out of her. It’s my firm belief that she doesn’t know how to
speak.”</p>
<p>“Bring out your scales,” said Hoskuld, “and let’s see how much this
purse of mine weighs.” Gilli did so; he weighed the silver and the
weight came to three marks.</p>
<p>“Then we’ve got a deal,” said Hoskuld. “You take the money, and I’ll
take the woman. I must say that you have behaved honorably in this
affair, because you didn’t try to cheat me at all.”</p>
<p>Then Hoskuld returned to his booth. That night he slept with the
slavewoman. Next morning when it was time to get dressed, Hoskuld said,
“Gilli the Rich didn’t give you very much in the way of clothing, but I
dare say it was more of a problem for him to clothe twelve women than
for me to clothe one.”</p>
<p>Then Hoskuld opened a chest and took out some fine clothing, which he
gave to her. Everyone agreed that she looked good in the clothes. When
the chieftains had concluded the business that the law demanded, the
assembly came to an end. Then Hoskuld went to see King Hakon and
addressed him with respect, as was fitting. The king looked at him and
said, “We would have accepted your greeting, Hoskuld, even if you had
delivered it a little sooner, but we shall accept it even now.”</p>
