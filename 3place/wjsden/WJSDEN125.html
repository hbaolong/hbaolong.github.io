<h4 id="the-burning-of-njal">86. The Burning of Njal</h4>
<p>The alacrity with which Njal’s assailants decide to use fire
contrasts markedly with Gizur the White’s honorable refusal to deal that
way with Gunnar. Flosi Thordarson’s quarrel is with Njal’s sons, and he
is willing to let Njal go free, but Njal elects to stay and share their
death by fire. Only Kari Solmundarson, a friend of Njal’s sons, escapes
from the burning. His revenge is the motivating force for the rest of
the saga.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 315–39.</p>
<ol start="124" type="1">
<li>Flosi summoned all his men to Almanna Gorge, and he went there
himself. By the time he got to the gorge, all one hundred and twenty of
his men had arrived. Flosi addressed the Sigfussons, “How can I help you
in this affair? What would suit you best?”</li>
</ol>
<p>Gunnar Lambason replied, “We won’t be happy until all the Njalsson
brothers are killed.”</p>
<p>“I give my word to the Sigfussons,” said Flosi, “that I won’t turn my
back on this business until one side destroys the other. And I’d like to
know if there is anyone here who doesn’t want to help.” They all
declared themselves willing to help.</p>
<p>“Then,” said Flosi, “let each of you come before me and take an oath
that you won’t give up on this undertaking.” They all went up to Flosi
and swore the oaths.</p>
<p>“We must also shake hands,” declared Flosi, “as a pledge that anyone
who pulls out will forfeit both life and property.”…</p>
<p>Flosi said to the Sigfussons, “Someone will have to take charge, so
choose a leader. Pick the man who seems best suited to the job.”</p>
<p>Ketil answered, “If the choice is up to us brothers, then we’ll all
choose you. There’s a lot to be said in your favor: you are well-born
and a great chieftain; you are strong-willed and wise; we also reckon
that you are the best man to look after our interests in the
affair.”</p>
<p>“Clearly, I should agree to your request,” replied Flosi, “and now
I’ll set out our course of action. My plan is for everyone to go home
from the Althing and see to his farm during the summer until the
haymaking is over. I will ride home too, and stay there for the summer.
On the Sunday eight weeks before winter, I’ll have a mass sung for me at
home and then I’ll ride west across Lomagnup Sand. Each of us must bring
two horses. I won’t add anyone to our group beyond those who have just
sworn the oaths, because there are enough of us if we all keep our word.
I’ll ride all that Sunday and overnight too and, by the evening of the
second day of the week, I’ll arrive at Thrihyrning Ridge. All of you who
have taken the oath should be there by then. If anyone who has committed
himself to this business doesn’t show up, he must pay for it with his
life, if we’re successful…. When we’ve assembled, we’ll all ride to
Bergthorshval and attack the Njalssons with fire and iron and we won’t
quit until they are all dead. You must keep this plan secret; all our
lives depend on it. Now let’s fetch our horses and ride home.”…</p>
<p>One day, Hrodny, mother of Hoskuld Njalsson, arrived at Keldur. Her
brother Ingjald gave her a warm welcome, but she ignored his greeting
and asked him to go outside with her. He did so, and they walked out of
the farmyard together. Then, she clutched at him and they sat down.</p>
<p>“Is it true,” she asked, “that you have sworn to attack Njal and his
sons and kill them?” “It is true,” he replied.</p>
<p>“What a vile wretch you are,” she said, “considering that Njal has
saved you from outlawry three times.” “But as things stand now,” he
responded, “I’ll pay with my life if I don’t keep my word.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true,” she said. “You’ll go on living and be reckoned an
honorable man if you don’t betray the man who deserves most from
you.”</p>
<p>Then, she took a tattered and blood-stained linen hood from her
purse.</p>
<p>“Hoskuld Njalsson was wearing this hood when they killed him,” she
said. “I think it reflects badly on you to help the people
responsible.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” replied Ingjald. “I won’t take sides against Njal whatever
the consequences. But I know that they will make trouble for me.”</p>
<p>“You could help Njal greatly if you warned him about their plans,”
said Hrodny.</p>
<p>“I won’t do that,” he answered, “because I would be despised by
everyone if I revealed what was told to me in confidence. I can, though,
in all honor pull out of this business, since I know they will take
revenge. But tell Njal and his sons that it would be a good idea to be
on their guard this summer and to have plenty of men on hand.”</p>
<p>After that, Hrodny went to Bergthorshval and related the entire
conversation to Njal. Njal thanked her and said she had done well: “For
it would be especially wicked for him, of all men, to be against me.”
She returned home and Njal told his sons what she had said….</p>
<ol start="126" type="1">
<li>Two months before winter, Flosi got ready to travel west and
summoned all the men who had promised to go with him. Each of them had
two horses and good weapons. They all came to Svinafell and stayed there
overnight. Early on Sunday, Flosi had prayers said and then he sat down
to eat. He told his servants what work each of them was to do in his
absence. After that, he went to his horses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Flosi and his men rode west to Lomagnup Sand. He ordered them not to
ride too fast at first, but told them they would speed up toward the end
of the journey. He said that if anyone had to stop, the others should
all wait. They rode west to Skogahverf and arrived at Kirkjubae where
Flosi asked all his men to come to church and say their prayers. They
did so.</p>
<p>Then they mounted their horses and rode uphill as far as Fish Lakes.
They rode to the west of the lakes, and then headed west for Maelifell
Sand. Keeping Eyjafell Glacier on their left, they made their way down
to Godaland, and on to Markarfljot. At the hour of nones [3:00 pm] on
the second day of the week, they arrived at Thrihyrning Ridge and waited
there until midevening. By then, everyone had turned up except Ingjald
from Keld. The Vigfussons had harsh words for him, but Flosi asked them
not to malign Ingjald in his absence. “However,” he said, “we’ll make
him pay later.”</p>
<ol start="127" type="1">
<li>Now the tale turns to Njal’s farm at Bergthorshval. The brothers
Helgi and Grim left Bergthorshval and went to Holar where their children
were being fostered. They told their father, Njal, that they would not
be back that night. The brothers spent the whole day at Holar. Some
beggar women turned up there, saying that they had come a long way. Grim
and Helgi asked them if they had any news. The women said they had no
real news, but they could tell something unusual was going on. The
brothers asked the women what they meant and entreated them not to hide
anything. The women said they wouldn’t.</li>
</ol>
<p>“When we were coming down from Fljotshlid,” they said, “we saw all
the Vigfussons riding fully armed. There were fifteen of them altogether
and they were heading up to Thrihyrning Ridge. We also saw Grani
Gunnarson and Gunnar Lambason in a group of five all riding in the same
direction. It could be said that the whole countryside is on the move at
the moment.”</p>
<p>“Then Flosi must have arrived from the east,” said Helgi Njalson,
“and all the others are going to join him. Grim, we should be at home
with our brother Skarphedin.”</p>
<p>Grim agreed and they returned home.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at Bergthorshval, Bergthora, Njal’s wife, spoke to her
household, “You must all choose your own food tonight and everyone is to
have what he likes best, for this is the last evening I will serve food
to my household.”</p>
<p>“That won’t happen,” said the people standing near. “It will happen,”
she answered, “and I could tell you about a lot more if I wanted to. But
this will be a sign: Grim and Helgi will come home this evening before
people have finished eating. If this comes true, so will the rest of
what I say.” Then she carried food to the table.</p>
<p>“This is very strange,” said Njal. “It seems to me that I can see all
around the room, and it looks as if both gable walls have collapsed; and
the table and the food are soaked in blood.” This seemed ominous to
everyone but Skarphedin. He told them not to despair or indulge in any
discreditable behavior that people could talk about. “We have a greater
obligation to behave well than other people do,” said Skarphedin, “and
that’s only to be expected.”</p>
<p>To everyone’s astonishment, Grim and Helgi returned home before the
tables had been cleared away. When Njal asked why they had come back so
soon, they told him what they had heard. Njal told everyone not to go to
bed that night.</p>
<ol start="128" type="1">
<li>Now the story turns to Flosi. He said to his men, “We’ll ride to
Bergthorshval now and get there before supper-time.” There is a valley
in the knoll on which Njal’s farm stands. They rode into the valley,
tied up their horses, and stayed there until late in the evening.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Now we’ll go to the farm,” said Flosi. “Let’s stay close together,
and advance slowly until we see what they do.”</p>
<p>Njal was standing outside with his sons, and Kari, and all the
man-servants; there were nearly thirty men altogether drawn up in the
yard in front of the house.</p>
<p>Flosi came to a halt.</p>
<p>“Now we’ll have to wait and see what they intend to do,” he said,
“because I don’t think that we’ll ever get the upper hand if they stay
outside.”</p>
<p>“If we don’t dare attack them, we’ve had a wasted journey,” said
Grani.</p>
<p>“It won’t come to that,” said Flosi. “We will attack them even if
they do stay outside, but we’ll pay dearly because not many of us will
live to say who wins.”</p>
<p>Njal said to his men, “What do you think? How many men have they
got?”</p>
<p>“They have a good-sized force of tough-looking men,” said Skarphedin.
“Even so, they’ve come to a halt because they think we’ll be hard to
beat.”</p>
<p>“That’s not why they’ve halted,” said Njal. “I want everyone to go
inside the house, because the men who attacked Gunnar at Hlidarend had a
hard time overpowering him, even though he was on his own. The house
here is just as well-built as the one at Hldarend, so they won’t be able
to defeat us.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the way to go about things,” said Skarphedin. “The
chieftains who attacked Gunnar were honorable men who would have turned
back rather than burn him in his house. But this lot will use fire if
they can’t defeat us any other way, because they will do anything to get
the better of us. They will think, and rightly so, that we’ll kill them
if we escape. Besides, I’m not keen on being suffocated like a fox in
its den.”</p>
<p>“As usual, my sons,” said Njal, “you’re going to ignore my advice and
show me no respect. You didn’t behave like this when you were younger,
and things went better for you then.”</p>
<p>“Let’s do as our father wishes,” said Helgi. “That will be our best
plan.” “I’m not so sure about that,” replied Skarphedin, “for he’s a
doomed man now. But, nonetheless, I’ve no objection to humoring him and
being burned inside the house with him, because I’m not afraid of
death.”</p>
<p>He spoke to Kari, “Let’s stick together, kinsman, so that we don’t
get separated from one another.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I had in mind,” said Kari, “but if fate decrees
otherwise, then so be it; there’s nothing to be done about it.”</p>
<p>“Avenge us,” said Skarphedin, “and we’ll do the same for you if we
survive.”</p>
<p>“Agreed,” said Kari. Then they all went into the house and took up
position at the doors.</p>
<p>“They’re finished now that they’ve gone indoors,” said Flosi. “Let’s
get to the house quickly and form up as closely as possible around the
doors. That way we can make sure that no one escapes, neither Kari nor
the Njalssons—otherwise we’ll end up dead.”</p>
<p>Flosi and his followers advanced and surrounded the house in case
there was a secret exit. Then Flosi and his own men went up to the front
of the house. Hroald Ozurarson ran up to Skarphedin and thrust at him
with a spear. Skarphedin chopped the head off the spear-shaft, leapt at
Hroald, and swung at him with his ax. The ax struck Hroald’s shield and
slammed it against his body. The upper point of the ax sliced into
Hroald’s face and immediately he fell back dead.</p>
<p>“No one gets away from you, Skarphedin,” said Kari. “You’re the
bravest of us all.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Skarphedin and drew back his lips in
a grin. Kari, Grim, and Helgi kept thrusting with their spears and
wounded many men. Flosi and his men got nowhere.</p>
<p>Flosi said, “Our men have taken a lot of punishment. Many are wounded
and the man we can spare least is dead. Several of our men are not
fighting as boldly as they said they would and, clearly, we’re not going
to defeat them with weapons. Now we need to adopt another plan. We have
two choices, and neither is attractive. Either we turn back, and that
will be the death of us, or we burn them in their house, and for that
we’ll have to answer to God, for we are Christians. However, that’s the
step we have to take.”</p>
<ol start="129" type="1">
<li>Then they laid a fire and built a huge blaze in front of the door.
Skarphedin said, “So you fellows are lighting a fire now. Are you
planning to cook something?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“Right. And it will be hot enough for baking,” replied Grani
Gunnarson.</p>
<p>“This is how a man like you repays me for avenging your father,” said
Skarphedin. “You value most what you should value least.” Then the women
in the house threw whey on the fire and extinguished it despite the
efforts of Flosi and his men.</p>
<p>“I have an idea,” said Kol Thorsteinsson to Flosi. “I spotted a loft
above the cross-beams in the hall. Let’s build a fire in there and
kindle it with chickweed from the pile behind the house.”</p>
<p>So they fetched the chickweed and set fire to it. The people inside
didn’t notice the fire until the hall was completely ablaze above their
heads. Then Flosi and his men built huge fires in front of all the
doors. The women in the house grew distraught, and Njal said to them,
“Take heart, and don’t talk about giving up hope, for this is only a
passing storm, and it will be a long time before we have another one
like it. Have faith in God’s mercy; he won’t let us burn both in this
world and the next.” Such were the words of reassurance he gave them,
and he made other remarks, too, that were even more encouraging.</p>
<p>Now the whole house began to burn. Njal went to the door and said,
“Is Flosi close enough to hear what I have to say?” Flosi said that he
could hear, and Njal continued, “Would you make terms with my sons, or
let some people leave?”</p>
<p>Flosi answered: “I won’t make a settlement with your sons. We’re
going to finish with them now, and we won’t leave until they are all
dead. But I will allow women, children, and man-servants to get
out.”</p>
<p>Njal went in and spoke to his household: “Everyone who has permission
to leave must go now. You must go too, Thorhalla Asgrim’s daughter, and
take with you everyone who is allowed out.”</p>
<p>“I never expected to part from Helgi like this,” replied Thorhalla,
“but I’ll persuade my father and brothers to avenge the lives lost
here.”</p>
<p>“You’ll do well,” said Njal, “because you are a good woman.” Then she
went out and many people went with her.</p>
<p>Astrid from Djuparbak said to Helgi, “Come out with me; I’ll throw a
woman’s cloak over you and cover your head with a hood.” At first, he
was reluctant, but at length he gave in to their entreaties. Astrid
wrapped his head in a hood while Thorhild put the cloak over him. He
walked out between them accompanied by his sisters, Thorgerd and Helga,
and several other people.</p>
<p>When Helgi came out, Flosi said, “Look how tall that woman is, and
how broad her shoulders are. Grab her and hang onto her.”</p>
<p>When Helgi heard this, he threw off the cloak. He had concealed a
sword under his arm and he struck out with it, cutting off the point of
a man’s shield and his leg as well. Then Flosi came up and slashed at
Helgi’s neck, beheading him instantly.</p>
<p>Flosi went up to the door and asked Njal and Bergthora to come and
talk to him. They did so. Flosi said, “I want to offer you safe passage,
because you don’t deserve to be burnt in there.”</p>
<p>“I’m not coming out,” replied Njal, “because I’m an old man, and
scarcely fit to avenge my sons, and I don’t want to live in shame.”</p>
<p>Then Flosi said to Bergthora, “Why don’t you come out, Bergthora? The
last thing I want is to burn you with the house.”</p>
<p>Bergthora replied, “I was young when I was given to Njal, and I
promised him that we would share the same fate.” Both went back into the
house. “What shall we do now?” asked Bergthora. “We’ll go to bed and lie
down,” said Njal.</p>
<p>Then Bergthora said to the boy, Thord Karason, “Someone will take you
outside; you mustn’t burn in here.”</p>
<p>“Grandmother,” said the boy, “you promised that we would never be
parted, and that’s how it will be, because I think it’s much better to
die here with you.”</p>
<p>Then she carried the boy to the bed.</p>
<p>Njal said to his steward, “Pay attention to where we lie down and how
we settle ourselves so that you’ll know exactly where to find our
remains, for I don’t intend to stir from here, no matter how much I’m
bothered by the smoke and fire.”</p>
<p>The steward replied that he would do so. An ox had been slaughtered
and its hide was lying close by. Njal told the steward to spread the
hide over them, and he promised that he would. Then Njal and Bergthora
lay down in the bed with the boy between them. They crossed themselves
and the boy, and entrusted their souls to God’s hands. Not another word
was heard from them. The steward picked up the hide and covered them
with it. Then he left the house. Ketil of Mark grabbed hold of him and
hauled him out. He questioned the steward closely about his
father-in-law, Njal, and the steward told him the whole story. “Terrible
sorrow has befallen us; we have so much misfortune to share,” said
Ketil.</p>
<p>Skarphedin had noticed when his father lay down and what preparations
he had made. “Our father has gone to bed early,” he said, “and that’s
only to be expected since he is an old man.”</p>
<p>Skarphedin, Kari, and Grim picked up burning fragments as quickly as
they fell and hurled them at the people outside. This went on for a
while. Then the attackers threw spears at them, but they caught them all
in flight and threw them back. Flosi ordered his men to stop the
spear-throwing: “Exchanging weapons with them will only go badly for us.
It will be better to wait till the fire overcomes them.” And so they
did. Then huge beams began to fall from the roof.</p>
<p>“My father must be dead by now,” said Skarphedin, “and not a groan or
a cough has been heard from him.” Then they went to the end of the hall
where the crossbeam had fallen down at a slant; it was badly burnt in
the middle.</p>
<p>Kari said to Skarphedin, “Run up here and jump out. I’ll give you a
hand and come right behind you. This way we’ll both get away, because
all the smoke is blowing toward us.” “You jump first, and I’ll follow
you straightaway,” Skarphedin replied.</p>
<p>“That’s not a good idea,” said Kari, “because I’ll find another way
out, if I don’t get out here.”</p>
<p>“I’m not having that,” said Skarphedin. “You go first, and I’ll be
hard on your heels.” “Every man has a duty to save his own life, and
that’s what I’m going to do,” said Kari. “After we part, we’ll never see
each other again, for if I once escape from this fire, I won’t feel like
jumping back in again, and we’ll each have to go our own way.”</p>
<p>“It’s a consolation, brother-in-law, that you will avenge us if you
get away,” said Skarphedin. Kari seized a burning log and ran up the
crossbeam. He flung the log from the roof and it landed on the people
outside. They leapt out of the way. By this time, all of Kari’s clothes
and his hair had caught fire. He threw himself down from the roof and
stumbled away under cover of the smoke. One of the men outside said,
“Was that a man jumping from the roof?”</p>
<p>“No,” replied one of the others. “It was Skarphedin throwing a
burning log at us.”</p>
<p>After that, they suspected nothing.</p>
<p>Kari ran till he reached a stream; he threw himself in and doused the
flames. Then, he ran on, hidden by the smoke, until he reached a hollow
where he rested. Ever since, the hollow has been called Kari’s
Hollow.</p>
<ol start="130" type="1">
<li>Now the story tells us that Skarphedin ran up the crossbeam right
behind Kari. But when he reached the most badly burnt section, it
collapsed under him. Skarphedin landed on his feet. Immediately, he had
another try, scrambling up the wall this time, but the main beam gave
way and he tumbled back again.</li>
</ol>
<p>“Now it’s clear how things will be,” said Skarphedin. Then he walked
along by the side wall. Gunnar Lambason jumped onto the wall and saw
Skarphedin. “Are you weeping now, Skarphedin?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” replied Skarphedin, “though it is true that my eyes are
smarting. You seem to be laughing; am I right?”</p>
<p>“I am indeed,” said Gunnar, “and I haven’t laughed once since you
killed Thrain.”</p>
<p>“Well here’s something to remember him by,” said Skarphedin. From his
purse, he took out a molar that he had hacked from Thrain’s mouth and
threw it at Gunnar’s eye. The eye popped from its socket and landed on
his cheek. Then Gunnar fell off the roof.</p>
<p>Skarphedin went to his brother, Grim. They joined hands and beat down
the fire with their feet. But when they reached the middle of the hall,
Grim fell down dead, and when Skarphedin got to the end of the hall, the
whole roof collapsed with a huge crash. He was trapped between the
fallen roof and the gable and could not move an inch.</p>
<p>Flosi and his men stayed by the fire until well after dawn. Then a
man came riding up and Flosi asked his name. He said his name was
Geirmund, and he was a relative of the Sigfussons. “You have done great
things,” he said.</p>
<p>“People will call them evil as well as great,” replied Flosi. “But
there’s nothing to be done about it now.”</p>
<p>“How many well-known people died here?” asked Geirmund.</p>
<p>“Njall and Bergthora died here,” replied Flosi. “So did the
Njalssons, Helgi, Grim, and Skarphedin, as well as Thord Karason, Kari
Solmundarson, and Thord the freedman. We’re not sure about others whom
we don’t know so well.”</p>
<p>“You’re counting among the dead a man who got away,” said Geirmund.
“I know because I talked to him this morning.”</p>
<p>“Who is that?” asked Flosi.</p>
<p>“Kari Solmundarson,” replied Geirmund. “My neighbor Bard and I met
him, and Bard gave him his horse. His hair and clothes had been burnt
off.”</p>
<p>“Was he armed?” asked Flosi.</p>
<p>“He had the sword Fjorsvafnir [Taker of Life],” answered Geirmund.
“One edge had turned blue and we said that it must have lost its temper.
But he replied that he would restore its temper in the blood of the
Sigfussons and the other arsonists.”</p>
<p>“Did he mention Skarphedin or Grim?” Flosi asked.</p>
<p>“He told us that they were both alive when he parted from them, but
that they would be dead by now,” said Geirmund.</p>
<p>“There’s little hope of peace in what you’ve told us,” said Flosi,
“for the man who has just escaped is the one who comes closest, in every
respect, to being a match for Gunnar of Hldarend. You Sigfussons, and
the rest of us as well, must understand that the aftermath of this
burning will be so serious that many men will lose their heads, and
others will forfeit everything they own. I suspect that none of you
Sigfussons will dare stay in your own homes now, and for good reason, so
I’m inviting all of you to come east with me. Let’s face our fate
together.” They thanked him. Then, Motholf Ketilsson composed this
poem:</p>
<p>Out of all the gold-givers</p>
<p>a single man survives the</p>
<p>bright blaze of Njal’s house,</p>
<p>set by the Sigfussons.</p>
<p>Now, Njal, the murder</p>
<p>of the hero Hoskuld is paid for</p>
<p>by fire burning brightly,</p>
<p>by flames flooding the house.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to find something to boast about other than the burning
of Njal,” said Flosi. “There’s no glory in that.”</p>
<p>Then Flosi climbed onto the gable, along with Glum Hildisson and a
few others.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Skarphedin is dead yet,” said Glum. The others replied
that he must have been dead for a while. The fire flared up at times,
and died down at others. Then, from the depths of the fire, they heard
this poem being recited:</p>
<p>The woman will weep,</p>
<p>the golden girl shed tears,</p>
<p>for the bearer of the bridge-curved shield,</p>
<p>for the spirited warrior in the spear-shower.</p>
<p>Spears sing in flight,</p>
<p>trusty friends of wounded flesh;</p>
<p>strong in spirit I advanced.</p>
<p>Edges cut; in showers fell wound-giving shafts.</p>
<p>“Do you think Skarphedin was dead or alive when he recited that
poem?” asked Grani Gunnarsson. “I’m not going to speculate about that,”
replied Flosi.</p>
<p>“Let’s look for Skarphedin and the others who were burned alive in
here,” said Grani.</p>
<p>“No,” said Flosi. “Only a fool like you would think of something like
that at a time when men must be assembling forces all over the district.
Anyone who hangs about now will be so scared later on that he won’t know
which way to run. My advice is that we all ride away as fast as we can.”
Flosi and all his men went in haste to their horses.</p>
