<h4 id="the-goading-of-hildigunn-aaaaaaaa">26. The Goading of Hildigunn
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Hildigunn had not long been married to Hoskuld, Njal’s foster son,
when he was murdered by Njal’s own sons in the seemingly endless chain
of revenge that overshadows Njal’s Saga. In this passage, Hildigunn
attempts to shame Flosi Thordarson, her kinsman, into taking revenge on
Hoskuld’s murderers.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Brennu-Njáls saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit XII (Reykjavík, 1954), pp. 289–318.</p>
<ol start="116" type="1">
<li>Hildigunn was outside in the yard. “I’d like all my menfolk to be
waiting out here when Flosi arrives,” she said. “The women are to clean
the house, hang up the tapestries, and get the high seat ready for
Flosi.” Later on, when Flosi rode into the homestead, Hildigunn went to
meet him and said, “Welcome, kinsman, it does my heart good to see
you.”</li>
</ol>
<p>“We’ll have a meal here with you, before riding on,” replied Flosi.
Then their horses were tied up. Flosi went into the main room and, as he
sat down, he shoved the high seat onto the floor. “I’m not a king or an
earl,” he said, “so I don’t need to have a high seat under me. And
there’s no need to make fun of me either.”</p>
<p>Hildigunn was standing nearby and replied, “It’s a pity you’re not
pleased, because we acted with the best of intentions.”</p>
<p>Flosi answered, “If you mean well, your good intentions will speak
for themselves: if you mean ill, your evil intentions will condemn
themselves.”</p>
<p>Hildigunn laughed bitterly. “This is just the beginning,” she said.
“We’ll grapple more closely before this is over.” She sat down beside
Flosi and they talked quietly for a long time.</p>
<p>After a while the tables were set up, and Flosi and his men washed
their hands. Flosi looked at the hand towel; it was in tatters and torn
at one end. Not wishing to dry himself with it, he flung it down on the
bench. Then he hacked a piece from the tablecloth, dried himself on
that, and threw it to his men. After that, Flosi sat down at the table
and told his men to eat.</p>
<p>Hildigunn came into the room. She walked over to Flosi, pushed the
hair back from her eyes and wept. Flosi said, “You are downcast,
kinswoman, so you are crying. But it is good to weep for a good
man.”</p>
<p>“What legal action will you take on my behalf?” she asked. “What help
will you give me?”</p>
<p>“I will prosecute the case to the full extent of the law,” Flosi
said, “or I’ll arrange a settlement which good men will regard as being
honorable in every respect.”</p>
<p>Hildigunn replied, “If Hoskuld had been obliged to take up your
cause, he would have avenged you.”</p>
<p>“You’re a cruel woman,” answered Flosi. “It’s clear what you want.”
Hildigunn replied, “Arnor Ornolfsson from Forsarskogar committed less of
an offence against Thord Freysgodi [priest of Frey], your father, yet
your brothers, Kolbein and Egil, killed him for it at the Skaftafell
Thing.”</p>
<p>Hildigunn went into the hall and opened up her chest. She took out
the cloak which Flosi had given to Hoskuld, the cloak he had been
wearing when he was killed. She had kept it there with all its dried
blood. She returned to the main room with the cloak and walked up to
Flosi without saying a word. He had eaten his fill and the table had
been cleared. Hildigunn draped the cloak around Flosi’s shoulders; the
blood showered all over him. Then she said, “You gave this cloak to
Hoskuld, Flosi, and now I give it back to you. He was killed in it. In
the name of God and good men I urge you to avenge all the wounds he
suffered in death—or be known by everyone as the lowest of the low. I
urge this by all the powers of your Christ and by your manhood, and your
courage.”</p>
<p>Flosi tore off the cloak and threw it in her face. “You are a real
monster,” he said. “You want us to do things that will turn out very
badly for all of us. The counsels of women are cold.”</p>
<p>Flosi was so infuriated that his face was by turns red as blood, pale
as ashes, and black as hell. He and his men went to their horses and
rode off. He rode to Holtsvad where he waited for the Sigfussons and
some other friends….</p>
<ol start="124" type="1">
<li>…Flosi said, “Now I’ll tell you all I have in mind: when we’ve
gathered there, we’ll all ride in a group to Bergthorshval and attack
the Njalssons with fire and iron….”</li>
</ol>
