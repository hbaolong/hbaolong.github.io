<h4 id="a-warrior-woman-aaaaaaaa">23. A Warrior-Woman AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Saxo Grammaticus’s History of the Danes, written in Latin, covers the
period from the mythical, pre-Christian past up to the historical
present in 16 books, and was completed around 1216. Much of Book 9 is
concerned with the exploits of the semi-legendary Danish warrior-king
Ragnar Lodbrok. Saxo includes the story of Ragnar’s infatuation with a
Norwegian warrior-woman named Ladgerda. Modern scholarship is skeptical
about the existence of such warrior-women.</p>
<p>Source: trans. Oliver Elton, The Nine Books of the Danish History of
Saxo Grammaticus (New York: Norroena Society, 1905), pp. 231–32; revised
by A.A. Somerville and R.A. McDonald from Saxo Grammaticus, Gesta
Danorum, ed. J. Olrik and H. Ræder (Hauniae: Levin Munksgaard, 1931),
pp. 251–52.</p>
<p>…At this time Fro (Frey?), the king of Sweden, after slaying Siward,
the king of the Norwegians, put the wives of Siward’s kinsfolk in bonds
in a brothel, and delivered them to public outrage. When Ragnar heard of
this, he went to Norway to avenge his grandfather. As he came, many of
the matrons, who had either suffered insult to their persons or feared
imminent peril to their chastity, hastened eagerly to his camp in male
attire, declaring that they would prefer death to outrage. Nor did
Ragnar, who was to punish this reproach upon the women, scorn to use
against the author of the infamy the help of those whose shame he had
come to avenge. Among them was Ladgerda, a skilled female warrior, who,
though a maiden, had the courage of a man, and fought in front among the
bravest with her hair loose over her shoulders. All marveled at her
matchless deeds, for her locks flying down her back betrayed that she
was a woman. Ragnar, when he had justly cut down the murderer of his
grandfather, asked many questions of his fellow soldiers concerning the
maiden whom he had seen so forward in the fray, and declared that he had
gained the victory by the might of one woman. Learning that she was of
noble birth among the barbarians, he steadfastly wooed her by means of
messengers. She spurned his mission in her heart, but feigned
compliance. Giving false answers, she made her panting wooer confident
that he would gain his desires; but ordered that a bear and a dog should
be set at the porch of her dwelling, thinking to guard her own room
against all the ardor of a lover by means of the beasts that blocked the
way. Ragnar, comforted by the good news, embarked, crossed the sea, and,
telling his men to stop in Gaulardale, as the valley is called, went to
the dwelling of the maiden alone. Here the beasts met him, and he thrust
one through with a spear, and caught the other by the throat, wrung its
neck, and choked it. Thus he had the maiden as the prize of the peril he
had overcome. By this marriage he had two daughters, whose names have
not come down to us, and a son Fridleif….</p>
<p>Afterwards, changing his love, and desiring Thora, the daughter of
the King Herodd, to wife, Ragnar divorced himself from Ladgerda; for he
thought ill of her trustworthiness, remembering that she had long ago
set the most savage beasts to destroy him….</p>

<li>Gudrun Drives her Sons to Take Revenge</li>
</ol>
<p>Excluded from the masculine political world, women often found
private means of making their influence felt. The heroic poem The
Goading of Gudrun (Guðrúnarhvöt) gives legendary expression to the power
of women to incite men to action. The poem is an episode from the story
of the Nibelungs and distantly recalls events of the fourth and fifth
centuries, involving figures such as Attila the Hun and Ermaneric the
Ostrogoth. From the Poetic Edda.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Die Lieder des Codex Regius,
ed. Gustav Neckel; 5th rev. edition, ed. Hans Kuhn (Heidelberg: Carl
Winter, 1983), pp. 263–68.</p>
<p>About Gudrun [a prose introduction]</p>
<p>When she had killed Attila [Attila the Hun, 406–453], Gudrun went to
the sea and waded in, wishing to drown herself. She could not sink, and
the sea swept her across the fjord to the land of King Jonakr, who
married her.</p>
<p>Their sons were Sorli, Erp, and Hamdir. Svanhild, Sigurd’s daughter
[by Gudrun], was raised there. She was given in marriage to Ermaneric
the Great [king of the Ostrogoths, d. 376]. Bikki was one of his
retainers. He advised Randver, the king’s son, to take her for himself.
Bikki then informed the king of this. The king had Randver hanged and
Svanhild trampled under horses’ hooves. When Gudrun heard of this, she
addressed her sons.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Then I heard</li>
</ol>
<p>a most fearful tirade,</p>
<p>words forced</p>
<p>into speech by terrible woe,</p>
<p>when with fierce words</p>
<p>cruel-hearted</p>
<p>Gudrun urged her sons</p>
<p>to the slaughter.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>“Why do you sit still,</li>
</ol>
<p>why sleep your lives away?</p>
<p>Why does it not grieve you</p>
<p>to talk cheerfully?</p>
<p>When Ermaneric</p>
<p>has trampled your sister,</p>
<p>still in her youth,</p>
<p>on the highway with horses</p>
<p>white, black, and gray,</p>
<p>the steady-paced horses of the Goths.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“You have not turned out</li>
</ol>
<p>like Gunnar,</p>
<p>still less are you as bold</p>
<p>as Hogni was;</p>
<p>you would have</p>
<p>tried to avenge her</p>
<p>if you had the fierce spirit</p>
<p>of my brothers,</p>
<p>or the stern heart</p>
<p>of the Hunnish kings.”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Then said Hamdir</li>
</ol>
<p>the great-hearted:</p>
<p>“Little would you have praised</p>
<p>Hogni’s valor</p>
<p>when they wakened Sigurd</p>
<p>from sleep,</p>
<p>when your costly bed-sheets,</p>
<p>blue and white,</p>
<p>were reddened in your husband’s blood,</p>
<p>Soaked in the blood of the slain.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>“Revenge for your brothers</li>
</ol>
<p>became cruel and painful for you</p>
<p>when you murdered your sons.</p>
<p>All of us,</p>
<p>being of one mind,</p>
<p>could have taken vengeance</p>
<p>on Ermaneric</p>
<p>for our sister.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“Bring out the treasures</li>
</ol>
<p>of the Hunnish kings;</p>
<p>you have goaded us</p>
<p>to settlement by the sword.”</p>

<li>Laughing, Gudrun</li>
</ol>
<p>turned to her storehouse,</p>
<p>from chests chose</p>
<p>the crested helmets of kings,</p>
<p>long coats of mail,</p>
<p>and brought them to her sons.</p>
<p>Boldly, they leapt</p>
<p>onto the backs of their horses.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Then said Hamdir</li>
</ol>
<p>the great-hearted:</p>
<p>“It may happen</p>

<p>in Gothic lands,</p>
<p>will come back</p>
<p>to visit his mother</p>
<p>so that you may drink</p>

<li>Gudrun Osvifrsdaughter’s Incitement of her Sons</li>
</ol>
<p>A tenth-century Gudrun follows her namesake’s example in The Saga of
the People of Laxdale.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Laxdæla saga, ed. Einar Ól.
Sveinsson, Íslenzk fornrit V (Reykjavík, 1934), pp. 179–81.</p>
<ol start="60" type="1">
<li>A few days after her return, Gudrun called her sons to the vegetable
garden for a talk. When they got there they saw linen clothes spread on
the ground; there was a shirt and a pair of trousers and they were
covered with blood.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gudrun said, “The clothes you see here challenge you to avenge your
father. I’m not going to say much; it’s not to be expected that
speechifying will move you in the right direction if you aren’t moved by
tokens and reminders like these.”</p>
<p>The brothers were shocked by what Gudrun said and answered that they
had been too young to take revenge and had no one to lead them. They
said that they had no idea how to make plans, either for themselves or
for others. “But we certainly haven’t forgotten what we have lost.”</p>
<p>Gudrun said that in her opinion they were much more interested in
horsefights and sports. After that the brothers went away, but that
night they could not sleep. Thorgils noticed this and asked them what
was wrong. They related to him the whole exchange between themselves and
their mother; they said, too, that they could not bear their own sorrow
or their mother’s taunting any longer. “We want to try for revenge,”
said Bolli. “We brothers are old enough now for people to reproach us if
we don’t lift a finger.”</p>
<p>The following day Thorgils and Gudrun had a talk and Gudrun began
like this:</p>
<p>“I think, Thorgils, that my sons have had enough of doing nothing and
making no attempt to avenge their father. Till now, the main reason for
delay has been my feeling that Thorleik and Bolli were too young to be
plotting against men’s lives. However, there has been good reason to
talk about this long before now.”</p>
<p>“It’s no use discussing this business with me,” Thorgils replied,
“when you have flatly refused to marry me. My thoughts on the matter are
the same as they were when we discussed it before. If I can persuade you
to marry me, then it won’t bother me a bit to kill one or both of the
men most involved in the slaying of Bolli.”</p>
<p>Gudrun said, “I know that Thorleik thinks no one is better suited
than you to take the lead when there is work to be done that requires
boldness. I won’t conceal from you the fact that the boys intend to take
aim at Helgi Hardbeinsson, the berserk [see doc. 30], who lives on his
farm at Skorradal and is not afraid of anything.”</p>
<p>Thorgils answered, “It makes no odds to me whether he goes by the
name of Helgi or has some other name, because I don’t think it’s beyond
my powers to deal with Helgi or anyone else. This will be my last word
on the subject, so long as you promise before witnesses that you will
marry me if I help your sons get their revenge.”</p>
<p>Gudrun said that she would honor any agreement she made, even if
there were few people to witness it. She said, too, that Thorgils’s
terms would be acceptable. Gudrun asked to have Thorgils’s
foster-brother Halldor and her sons called as witnesses. Thorgils asked
for Ornolf to be called too, but Gudrun said there was no need for this.
“I have more suspicions about Ornolf’s loyalty to you than you seem to
have yourself,” she said.</p>
<p>Thorgils left the decision to her. The brothers then arrived to join
Gudrun and Thorgils; Halldor was there talking to them. Gudrun now
explained to them how things stood: “Thorgils has promised to lead my
sons in a foray against Helgi Hardbeinsson as vengeance for Bolli. He
has stipulated that, in return, I will marry him. Now I call upon you to
witness my promise to Thorgils that I will marry no man in this land
except him, and I don’t plan to marry in another country.”</p>
<p>This seemed quite satisfactory to Thorgils and he didn’t see through
it. The parley broke up with full agreement that Thorgils was to take on
the exploit. He prepared to leave Helgafell with Gudrun’s sons. First
they went to Thorgils’s home at Tung and afterwards they rode into the
Dalir district.</p>
