<h4 id="the-western-ocean-aaaaaaaa">70. The Western Ocean AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>The King’s Mirror [Konungs-Skuggsjá or Speculum Regale] is a didactic
work composed in Norway during the reign of King Hakon IV (1217–63) and
has been called the most important Norwegian work of the Middle Ages. It
takes the form of a dialogue between a father and son in which the
father imparts knowledge on a variety of subjects to the son; it was
undoubtedly intended for one of the sons of King Hakon. The first part
is concerned with material that would be of use to merchants and
traders, including proper behavior in foreign lands, descriptions of
Ireland, Iceland, and Greenland, and information on the weather.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Speculum Regale.
Konungs-Skuggsjá, ed. R. Keyser, P.A. Munch, and C.R. Unger (Christiania
[Oslo]: Akademiske Collegium ved det kongelike norske
Frederiks-Universitet, 1848), pp. 29, 32, 33–40.</p>
<p>Wonders of the Iceland Sea</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li>In the seas around Iceland, there is not much that is memorable or
worth mentioning, apart from the whales, and these vary considerably in
size and species. The most numerous are called dolphins and they grow to
a length of twenty ells [Norwegian ell = 62.8 cm], though many of them
are much smaller and grow no longer than ten ells. The rest fall
somewhere in between and come in various sizes. These fish have neither
teeth nor whalebone, and present no danger to ships or men—in fact, they
tend to avoid fishermen. Even so, they are frequently rounded up and
driven ashore in their hundreds, and wherever they are caught in large
numbers, they provide men with an excellent source of food. There are
also other kinds of small whales such as the porpoise, which grows no
longer than five ells, or the leiptr [?] which grows no larger than
seven ells….</li>
</ol>
<p>There is one fish that I haven’t mentioned yet and I am reluctant to
describe it because of its size which will seem incredible to most
people. Very few people are able to say anything definite about this
fish since it is very rarely seen. This is because it hardly ever comes
close to land and seldom shows itself where fishermen might see it. I do
not think that there are many of this sort of fish in the sea. We
usually call it hafgufa [mermaid] in our language. I cannot speak with
certainty about its length because, whenever one has been seen, it has
looked more like an island than a fish. I have never heard of any of
these fish being caught or found dead; it seems probable that there are
only two of them in existence and that they don’t reproduce, for I think
that we always see the same pair. If they were as numerous as other
whales, it would not bode well for other fish, because the hafgufa are
huge and need vast amounts of food. When they want something to eat,
these fish usually emit a huge belch and throw up lots of food so that
all kinds of fish in the area, both large and small will crowd up,
expecting to find food and good things to eat. In the meantime, this
great fish leaves its mouth wide open, and since the opening is as big
as a sound or a fjord, the fish cannot prevent themselves from flooding
into it in large numbers. As soon as its mouth and stomach are full, the
fish closes its mouth, thus trapping and shutting in all the fish which
had been looking for food there.</p>
<p>Of Iceland’s Fire and Ice</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li><p>As for the ice that is a feature of Iceland, I tend to think that
it’s the price Iceland has to pay for its proximity to Greenland; and
it’s no wonder that bitter cold emanates from Greenland, given that it
is much more ice-covered than any other land. It is because Iceland
absorbs so much cold from Greenland and receives so little warmth from
the sun that it has so much ice on its mountain ranges. But I’m not so
sure what to say about the surfeit of fire that is to be found there,
because it is a strange phenomenon. I have heard that there is a great
amount of fire in Sicily and that it burns both earth and vegetation. I
have also heard that, in his Dialogue, Gregory the Great [Pope Gregory
I, 590–604] states that there are places of torment in the fires of
Sicily. But men are more likely to believe that there are places of
torment in the fires of Iceland because the fires of Sicily consume
living things, such as earth and trees. Trees are alive; they grow and
produce green leaves…. The earth, too, may be said to be living because
it sometimes produces a bountiful harvest and, when that harvest has
withered, it produces another. The fires of Sicily, then, burn both
trees and earth and are nourished by them. The fires of Iceland,
however, do not consume earth or wood, even when those things are thrown
into them. Instead, they consume stone and hard rock…and there is no
stone or rock so hard that the fires will not melt it like wax or burn
it like fatty oil…. Now, since the Icelandic fire consumes only dead
things and rejects what other fires feed on, it may be called dead fire.
And so, it is very likely that the fire of Iceland is the fire of hell,
because everything in hell is dead.</p></li>
<li><p>I have no doubt that there are places of torment in Iceland other
than in the fires, for the amount of ice and frost in Iceland is as
excessive as that of the fire…. There are springs and streams of boiling
water…. There are also ice-cold streams which flow from beneath the
glaciers. These streams are so powerful that they cause the earth and
nearby mountains to tremble, for when water flows so rapidly and with
such force, mountains quake because of the overwhelming violence of the
torrent…. I am certain that there must be places of torment wherever
such great turbulence manifests itself and takes on such strange forms.
God has shown men such fearful phenomena openly here on earth…as a
sign…that men must expect torments when they leave this world unless
they shun evil deeds and wrong-doing while they are alive.</p></li>
<li><p>…In Iceland there is a great deal of the ore from which iron is
made. Icelanders call it “red ore” in their own language, which is what
we call it ourselves. This ore has been found in large quantities one
day, only to vanish without trace the following day when people were
ready to smelt it and make iron. No one knows what happens to it and, in
Iceland, this is called the red-ore mystery.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>On the Greenland Sea</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>…There is yet another marvel in the Greenland Sea, but I don’t know
much about it. It is called “sea hedges” and it looks for all the world
as if every wave and every storm at sea had come together and formed
three waves. These waves then form an unbroken wall of water that hedges
in the sea. The three waves are higher than mountains and resemble steep
precipices. In only a very few instances have men escaped after finding
themselves at sea when this phenomenon occurred. These stories must have
arisen because God has always spared some of the people who have been
exposed to these dangers and their tales have spread from one person to
another. We don’t know if these stories are exactly the same now as when
they were first told, or whether they have grown longer or become
shorter. Therefore, we must be cautious in speaking about these matters,
for we have come across very few people recently who have escaped to
tell the tale….</li>
