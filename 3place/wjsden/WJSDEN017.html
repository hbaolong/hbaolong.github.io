<h4 id="a-the-death-of-king-vikar">(a) The Death of King Vikar</h4>
<p>Part of the legendary Gautrek’s Saga tells the strange story of the
hero Starkad and his involvement in the sacrifice to Odin of Vikar, king
of Agder. Starkad is led to a council of the gods by his foster-father,
Grani Horsehairs, who turns out to be Odin in disguise. Odin demands
Starkad’s participation in the sacrifice of Vikar in return for his help
before the council. This passage contains a grim account of the Norse
gods and their very human capacity for vindictiveness. Adam of Bremen
also writes of human sacrifice at Uppsala (see doc. 15).</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Gautreks saga, in Fornaldarsögur
Norðurlanda, ed. Guðni Jónsson, 4 vols. (Reykjavík, 1959), vol. 4,
pp. 28–31.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>…King Vikar sailed north from Agder to Hordaland with a large fleet
of ships. They lay idle in a group of islands for a long time because of
unfavorable winds. Using augury, they discovered that Odin wanted them
to hang a man, chosen by lot from the army, in order to raise a fair
wind. So they drew lots, and King Vikar’s number came up. This took them
aback, and they decided to have a council meeting next day to discuss
the difficulty.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the middle of the night, Grani Horsehairs woke up his foster son
Starkad and told him to come with him. They took a small boat and rowed
to another island, closer to the shore. They landed there and went up
through the forest until they came to a clearing where a large crowd of
men were holding a meeting. Eleven men were sitting on chairs, but the
twelfth chair was empty. They joined the meeting, and Grani Horsehairs
sat down in the twelfth chair. Then everyone hailed him as Odin, and he
declared that the judges [the Æsir, the gods] must decide the fate of
Starkad.</p>
<p>Then Thor spoke: “Starkad’s father’s mother, Alfhild, chose a wise
giant to be father of her son, rather than Thor of the Æsir,” he said.
“So, what I have in mind for Starkad is that he shall never have a son
or a daughter, and that his line will end with him.”</p>
<p>Odin responded: “I shall grant that his one life will be as long as
three.”</p>
<p>Thor said: “He will perform a shameful act in each life.”</p>
<p>Odin answered: “I decree that he will have the finest weapons and
clothes.”</p>
<p>Thor said: “I decree that he will have neither land nor
homestead.”</p>
<p>Odin said: “I grant him money.” Thor said: “And I, that he will never
feel he has enough.”</p>
<p>Odin answered: “I give him victory and prowess in every battle.”</p>
<p>Thor said: “I declare that he will be wounded in every battle.”</p>
<p>Odin said: “I confer on him the gift of poetry, and the ability to
compose as fast as he speaks.” Thor said: “He will never remember what
he composes.”</p>
<p>Odin said: “I decree that the noblest and best men will think him
estimable.”</p>
<p>Thor said: “He will be loathed by everyone else.”</p>
<p>Then the judges confirmed that Starkad should have everything that
Odin and Thor had given him and, on that note, the meeting broke up.
Starkad and Grani Horsehairs made their way back to their boat, and
Grani said, “You must now reward me well, foster-son, for the help I
have given you.”</p>
<p>“Fine,” replied Starkad. “You must now send King Vikar to me,” said
Grani Horsehairs, “and I’ll tell you what to do.” Starkad agreed, and
Grani Horsehairs put a spear in his hand, saying that it would look like
a reed to everyone else. They returned to the fleet at daybreak.</p>
<p>In the morning, the king’s advisers held a meeting to consider the
problem and they all thought that the sacrifice should be symbolic.
Starkad told them what to do. Nearby grew a solitary fir tree and near
that stood a tall tree stump. Low on the fir tree was a thin branch
which reached up into the foliage. It was the time of the day when the
servants prepared food for the men, and a calf had been slaughtered and
disemboweled. Starkad had the calf’s guts fetched. Then he mounted the
tree stump, pulled the thin branch down, and tied the calf’s guts to it.
He addressed King Vikar:</p>
<p>“Your gallows is ready, king, and it doesn’t seem all that dangerous.
If you come over here I’ll put the noose around your neck.”</p>
<p>“If this contraption is no more dangerous than it appears,” said the
king, “it won’t do me any harm. But if things turn out differently, so
be it.”</p>
<p>The king mounted the tree stump, and Starkad placed the halter around
his neck. Then Starkad stepped down from the stump to the ground, thrust
at the king with the reed, and saying, “Now I give you to Odin,” let go
of the fir branch. The reed turned into a spear and went right through
the king. The tree stump fell away from under his feet. The calf’s
entrails became a strong rope, and the branch sprang up and lifted the
king to the top of the tree. The islands are now called Vikar’s
Islands.</p>
<p>This piece of work did not go down well with most of the people, and
Starkad was exiled from Hordaland. He fled from Norway and went east to
Sweden, where he stayed for a long time with the kings of Uppsala, Eirik
and Alrik, the sons of Agni Skjalfarbondi, and went on raids with
them.</p>
