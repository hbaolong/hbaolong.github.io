<h4 id="the-norse-creation-myth-aaaaaaaa">7. The Norse Creation-Myth
AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Snorri Sturluson’s Gylfaginning is a powerful retelling of many Norse
myths. Snorri gives his work the form of a dialogue between Gylfi, a
legendary king of Sweden, and Odin, who is presented here as a trinity:
Hárr (High One), Jafnhárr (Just as High), and Thridi (Third). Their
responses to Gylfi’s questions contain much of what we know about Norse
mythology. To conceal his identity, Gylfi adopts the pseudonym
Gangleri.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Snorri Sturluson, Edda.
Gylfaginning, ed. Anthony Faulkes (London: Viking Society for Northern
Research, 1988), pp. 8–19.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>This is how Gangleri began his questioning: “Who is the oldest and
most exalted of all the gods?”</li>
</ol>
<p>The High One said, “He is called All-Father in our language, but in
old Asgard, he had twelve names….”</p>
<p>“Where does this god live?” asked Gangleri. “What power does he have,
and what great deeds has he done?”</p>
<p>“He endures throughout all ages,” replied the High One. “He rules
over all his kingdom and he has power over all things, both great and
small.”</p>
<p>Then Just as High said, “He made heaven and earth, the sky, and
everything in them.”</p>
<p>“But his greatest achievement,” said Third, “was to create man and
give him a soul that will live and never perish, even though his body
molders to dust or is burned to ashes. And all men who are virtuous will
live, and they will dwell with him in Gimli or Vingof, but evil men will
go to Hel and from there to Niflheim, which is down in the ninth
world.”</p>
<p>“What did he do before the creation of heaven and earth?” asked
Gangleri.</p>
<p>“At that time, he dwelt with the Frost Giants,” replied the High
One.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“How did everything begin? What started it all? What was there
before?” asked Gangleri. The High One replied, “As Völuspá says,</li>
</ol>
<p>In earliest times</p>
<p>nothing existed;</p>
<p>there was no sand,</p>
<p>no sea, no chilly wave;</p>
<p>earth did not exist,</p>
<p>nor heaven overhead;</p>
<p>a great void yawned</p>
<p>and no grass grew.”</p>
<p>Then Just as High spoke, “Many ages before the earth was created,
Niflheim was formed. In the middle of Niflheim, there is a spring called
Hvergelmir out of which flow the rivers Svol, Gunnthra, Fjorm,
Fimbulthul, Slid and Hlid, Sylg and Ylg, Vid, Leipt, and Gjoll, which is
next to the gates of Hel.”</p>
<p>“But first,” said Third, “there was the world in the south, called
Muspell—a bright, hot place, blazing with fire and inaccessible to
outsiders who are not born there. A being named Surt is stationed at the
border to defend the land. He has a fiery sword, and, at the end of the
world, he will go forth and wage war, defeating all the gods and
destroying the whole world with fire. Thus says Völuspá,</p>
<p>Surt travels from the south</p>
<p>with the scorcher of trees;</p>
<p>from his sword flashes</p>
<p>the sun of the slaughter-gods;</p>
<p>rocks crash</p>
<p>and witches rove;</p>
<p>men tread Hel’s road</p>
<p>and heaven is split asunder.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Gangleri asked, “What were things like before the various races came
into being, and mankind increased and multiplied?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“There were rivers called the Elivagar [the Ice-waves] and when these
rivers had flowed some distance from their source, their poisonous
streams began to harden like slag from a forge and turned into ice,”
said the High One. “And when the ice ceased flowing and came to a stop,
the moisture arising from the poison froze and hardened into rime, and
the rime built up layer by layer, in Ginnungagap [the Yawning
Void].”</p>
<p>“The north-facing part of Ginnungagap filled up with thick, heavy ice
and rime, and from that direction there came drizzling rain and gusting
wind,” said Just as High. “But the southern part of Ginnungagap was
brightened by the sparks and glowing embers flying out of
Muspellsheim.”</p>
<p>Then Third said, “Just as everything that emerged from Niflheim was
cold and grim, so everything that faced toward nearby Muspellsheim was
hot and bright, and Ginnungagap was mild as a windless sky. And when the
warm breeze met the rime, it began to thaw and drip and, through the
power of heat, these flowing drops were quickened into life and assumed
the shape of a man. That man was named Ymir, but he is called Aurgelmir
by the Frost-giants, and they are all descended from him, as the Short
Völuspá tells us,</p>
<p>All seeresses</p>
<p>stem from Vidolf,</p>
<p>all wizards</p>
<p>from Vilmeid,</p>
<p>all sorcerers from</p>
<p>Svarthofdi,</p>
<p>and all giants</p>
<p>from Ymir.</p>
<p>And this is what Vafthruthnir the giant tells us:</p>
<p>When poisonous drops</p>
<p>sprayed up from Elivagar,</p>
<p>they grew until a giant emerged;</p>
<p>our kin are all</p>
<p>descended from him;</p>
<p>and so they are always fierce.”</p>
<p>“How did the various races evolve from him?” asked Gangleri, “How did
more men come into being? Or do you believe that Ymir is a god?”</p>
<p>The High One replied, “We do not regard him as a god at all. He was
evil like all his kin, whom we call Frost-giants. The story goes that he
fell asleep and began to sweat, and a man and a woman grew under his
left arm, and one of his legs begot a son with the other. Their
offspring are the Frost-giants; but the original Frost-giant is called
Ymir.”</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>“Where did Ymir live, and what did he live on?” asked Gangleri.</li>
</ol>
<p>“The next thing to emerge from the dripping rime was a cow called
Authumla. Four streams of milk flowed from her udder, and she fed
Ymir.”</p>
<p>“What did the cow live on?” asked Gangleri.</p>
<p>“She licked the rime-covered stones, which were salty,” replied the
High One. “On the first day that she licked the stones, a man’s hair
emerged toward evening. On the second day, his head appeared, and on the
third day, the whole man was visible. His name was Buri and he was a
big, strong, handsome man. He fathered a son named Borr, who married
Bestla, the daughter of the giant, Bolthorn. They had three sons: the
first was called Odin, the second Vili, and the third Ve. And it is my
belief that this Odin (and his brothers) must be the ruler of heaven and
earth; we think that he should be given the name ruler, for that is what
we call the greatest and worthiest man we know, and you would be
well-advised to call him that too.”</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>“How did they get on with one another? Which side was more
powerful?” asked Gangleri. “Borr’s sons killed Ymir the giant,” replied
the High One, “and when Ymir died, such a torrent of blood gushed from
his wounds that they drowned the whole race of Frost-giants in it, all
except for one, called Bergelmir, who escaped with his household. He and
his wife boarded their ark and were saved, and it is from them that the
Frost-giant families are descended, as it says here in
Vafþrúðnismál,</li>
</ol>
<p>Numberless winters</p>
<p>before the world was created,</p>
<p>Bergelmir was born;</p>
<p>what I recall first is</p>
<p>how that clever giant</p>
<p>took refuge on his ark.”</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>“What did Borr’s sons do then to make you regard them as gods?”
asked Gangleri.</li>
</ol>
<p>“There’s a lot to be said about that,” replied the High One. “They
picked Ymir up and carried him to the middle of Ginnungagap where they
created the earth from his body. They made the sea and the lakes from
his blood, the land from his flesh, and the mountains from his bones;
rocks and boulderfields were made out of his teeth, his molars, and any
broken bones.”</p>
<p>“They made the sea from the blood that flowed and gushed freely from
his wounds” added Just as High. “Then, when they had formed the earth
and firmed it into shape, they encircled it with the sea, which most men
will regard as impossible to cross.”</p>
<p>Then Third said, “They also took Ymir’s skull and made the sky out of
it, raising it up over the earth at four corners, and setting a dwarf
under each of them. These dwarfs are called: East, West, North, and
South. Next, they collected the sparks and glowing embers that had been
hurled out of Muspellsheim and were flying about freely. They placed
these throughout the vast heavens to light up the sky above and the
earth below. They allotted positions to all these burning masses. Some
were fixed in the firmament, while others moved about, but it was Borr’s
sons who assigned their positions and directed their courses. And thus,
according to ancient lore, it became possible to distinguish one day
from the next and reckon up the years; Völuspá tells us that this is
what things were like above the earth before that time,</p>
<p>The sun did not know</p>
<p>where her dwelling was,</p>
<p>the moon did not know</p>
<p>his own might and</p>
<p>the stars did not know</p>
<p>where they should stand.”</p>
<p>“These are important events I’m hearing about,” said Gangleri. “The
heavens are an astonishingly large creation, and skillfully made. How
was the earth constructed?”</p>
<p>The High One replied, “The earth is circular. Around it lies the deep
sea, and along the shore of this sea, Borr’s sons gave the giants lands
to live on. But further inland, they built a fortification around their
world as a defense against attack by the giants. They made this
fortification out of Ymir’s eyebrows and called it Midgard. They also
tossed Ymir’s brains into the sky and made clouds from them, as is said
in Grímnismál,</p>
<p>From Ymir’s flesh</p>
<p>the earth was formed,</p>
<p>from his blood the sea,</p>
<p>from his bones the mountains,</p>
<p>from his hair trees,</p>
<p>and from his skull the heavens.</p>
<p>And from his brows</p>
<p>the blessed gods</p>
<p>made middle-earth</p>
<p>for the sons of men;</p>
<p>and from his brains</p>
<p>all the sullen clouds</p>
<p>were created.”</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>“It seems to me that Borr’s sons achieved a great deal when heaven
and earth were created, and the sun and the stars put in place, and day
divided from night. Now where did the people who live in the world come
from?” asked Gangleri.</li>
</ol>
<p>The High One answered, “When Borr’s sons were walking along the
shore, they found two trees and created people from them. The first son
gave them breath and life, the second gave them intelligence and
feeling, and the third gave them form, speech, hearing, and sight. They
also gave them clothes and names. The man was called Ash, and the woman
Elm, and they begot the human race, which was given a home in Midgard.
Next Borr’s sons built themselves a city in the centre of the world and
named it Asgard, though we call it Troy. The gods and their descendants
settled there and from then on many incidents and events took place both
on earth and in heaven.</p>
<p>“In Asgard, there is a place called Hlidskjalf and when Odin sat
there in his high-seat, he looked out over the whole world and saw what
everyone was doing, and understood everything that he saw. His wife was
called Frigg Fjorvins-daughter, and from their family line come the
Aesir, a race of divine descent that lived in old Asgard and the
kingdoms belonging to it. Thus Odin may truly be called All-Father for
he is the father of all the gods and of men, and of everything else that
was brought into being by him and his might. Earth was both his daughter
and the wife by whom he sired his first son, Thor of the Aesir. Through
his power and strength he is master of all living things.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li><p>“Norfi or Narfi was a giant who lived in Jotunheim [Giant-Land].
He had a daughter called Night who was swarthy and dark like all her
family. She was given in marriage to a man called Naglfari and they had
a son called Aud. Next she was married to someone named Annar [Second]
and their daughter was called Earth. Her last marriage was to Delling,
who was one of the Aesir. Their son was Day and, like his father, he was
bright and beautiful. Then All-Father took Night and her son Day and
gave them two horses and two chariots and set them in the heavens to
ride around the Earth every day. Night rides ahead with the horse called
Hrimfaxi [Frost-Mane] and every morning he bedews the Earth with the
foam from his bit. Day’s horse is called Skinfaxi [Shining-Mane] and he
lights up all the Earth and the sky with his mane.”</p></li>
<li><p>Then Gangleri asked, “How does All-Father regulate the course of
the sun and the moon?” The High One replied, “There was a man named
Mundilfoeri who had two children. They were so beautiful and fair that
he called his son Mani [Moon] and his daughter Sol [Sun]. The gods,
infuriated by his arrogance, seized the brother and sister and placed
them in the heavens. They made Sol drive the horses that pulled the
chariot of the Sun. The gods had fashioned this chariot from the glowing
embers that flew out of Muspellsheim, in order to illuminate the worlds.
The horses are called Arvak [Early-Waker] and Alsvid [All-Burning]. To
keep them cool, the gods placed two bellows under their shoulder-blades;
in some sources these are called ‘iron-coolers.’ Mani directs the course
of the Moon and controls its waxing and waning. From earth, he carried
off two children named Bil and Hjuki as they were leaving a well called
Byrgir, carrying between them on their shoulders a bucket called Soeg,
on a pole called Simul. These children, the offspring of Vidfin, can be
seen from earth as they follow Mani.”</p></li>
<li><p>Then Gangleri said, “Sol travels fast, almost as if she were
afraid; indeed, she could not hurry along her course any faster even if
she were in fear of death.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>“It’s hardly surprising that she moves so quickly,” replied the High
One, “for she has a pursuer hard on her heels and flight is her only
means of escape.”</p>
<p>“Who is causing her this anxiety?” asked Gangleri.</p>
<p>“It is two wolves,” replied the High One, “The one pursuing her is
called Skoll. She is terrified of him, and he will catch her. The one
running ahead of her is called Hati Hrodvitnisson. He is eager to seize
hold of the Moon; and that too will happen.”</p>
<p>“What family do the wolves belong to?” asked Gangleri.</p>
<p>The High One replied, “A giantess lives to the east of Midgard in a
forest called Ironwood; in that forest live trollwomen, called the
Ironvidjur. The old giantess bears many giant sons, all of whom are
shaped like wolves, and it is from this line that these wolves are
descended. It is said that this family will produce a mighty wolf called
Managarm [Hound of the Moon], who will fill himself up with the blood of
everyone who dies. Then he will gulp down the Moon and shower all the
heavens and the sky with blood, causing the Sun to lose its brightness,
and blustery winds to blow hither and thither. As Völuspá says,</p>
<p>The old woman lives eastward</p>
<p>in Ironwood</p>
<p>and there gives birth to</p>
<p>Fenrir’s brood;</p>
<p>one will emerge,</p>
<p>one from among them all,</p>
<p>who, in troll’s skin,</p>
<p>will snatch the Moon.</p>
<p>He devours the flesh</p>
<p>of doomed men;</p>
<p>he reddens the gods’ home</p>
<p>with crimson gore;</p>
<p>the Sun’s rays will grow black</p>
<p>in the summers that follow,</p>
<p>the weather will always be wretched.</p>
<p>Do you wish to know more? And what?”</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>Then Gangleri asked, “What is the route from earth to heaven?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“That question isn’t too clever,” answered the High One, with a
laugh. “Hasn’t anyone told you that the gods built a bridge called
Bifrost between earth and heaven? You must have seen it; maybe it’s what
you call a rainbow. It is tri-colored and very strong, for it was
fashioned with more skill and knowledge than other constructions. But
strong as it is, the bridge will collapse when Muspell’s men come riding
across it….”</p>
<ol start="15" type="1">
<li>Then Gangleri said, “Where is the chief holy place of the
gods?”</li>
</ol>
<p>“It’s at the ash tree called Yggdrasil,” answered the High One.
“That’s where the gods must sit in judgment every day.”</p>
<p>“What is known about this place?” asked Gangleri.</p>
<p>Just as High answered him, “The ash is the greatest and best of all
trees. Its limbs spread out over the whole world and stretch across the
heavens. The tree is supported by three of its roots and these extend
for a very long way: one reaches to the Aesir, a second to the
Frost-giants, in what was once Ginnungagap [the Yawning Void], and the
third extends over Niflheim [Land of Fog]. The serpent Nidhogg gnaws at
the base of that root and under it is a spring called Hvergelmir. But
under the root which stretches toward the Frost-giants lies Mimir’s
Well, in which wisdom and understanding are kept. The well-keeper is
called Mimir; he is full of wisdom because he drinks well-water from the
Gjallarhorn [Bellowing Horn]. All-father went there and asked for a
single drink from the well, but he did not get it until he had laid down
his eye as a pledge. Thus says Völuspá,</p>
<p>Odin, I know all about</p>
<p>where you hid your eye</p>
<p>in Mimir’s famous well;</p>
<p>every morning, Mimir drinks</p>
<p>mead from Odin’s forfeit.</p>
<p>Do you wish to know more? And what?</p>
<p>The third root of the ash reaches to heaven and beneath it is a very
holy well called Urd’s [Fate’s] well, where the gods have their court.
Every day the Aesir ride there over Bifrost, which is also known as the
Aesir’s bridge….”</p>
<p>Then the High One said, “Under the ash, beside the well, there stands
a beautiful hall, and out of this hall come three maidens, whose names
are Urd [What Has Been], Verdandi [What Is], and Skuld [What Will Be].
These maidens, who shape the course of men’s lives, are called norns.
There are also other norns, who come to each man at birth to shape his
life. These norns are descended from the gods, but others are of elf
origin, and a third group is descended from dwarfs, as it says in
Fafnismál,</p>
<p>The norns, I know,</p>
<p>have numerous origins,</p>
<p>are not of the same family;</p>
<p>some are descended from gods</p>
<p>and some are from the elf-tribe,</p>
<p>some are daughters of dwarfs.”</p>
<p>Then Gangleri said, “If the norns control the fates of men, then they
allot these fates very unfairly, for some people have a successful and
prosperous life, while others get little honor or affluence. Some men
have a long life, while others have a short one.”</p>
<p>“Good, well-born norns shape good lives,” said the High One, “but the
people who suffer misfortune are controlled by evil norns.”</p>
<ol start="16" type="1">
<li>“Is there anything else of note to be said about the ash?” asked
Gangleri.</li>
</ol>
<p>“There is still a great deal to be said,” replied the High One. “In
the branches of the ash sits an eagle, which is knowledgeable about many
things, and between its eyes sits a hawk, called Vedrfolnir. A squirrel
named Ratatosk runs up and down the ash, carrying insults between the
eagle and Nidhogg. Four harts called Dain, Dvalin, Duneyr, and Durathror
run among the branches, eating the leaves. And, in Hvergelmir, there are
so many serpents in addition to Nidhogg that no tongue can count them.
As Grimnismál puts it,</p>
<p>The ash, Yggdrasil,</p>
<p>endures more anguish</p>
<p>than humankind knows;</p>
<p>above, a hart bites,</p>
<p>at the side, it rots; Nidhogg</p>
<p>gnaws from below.</p>
<p>Grimnismál also says,</p>
<p>More serpents</p>
<p>squirm under Yggdrasil</p>
<p>than old fools imagine;</p>
<p>Goin and Moin</p>
<p>—they are the sons of Grafvitnir—</p>
<p>Grabbak and Grafvollud,</p>
<p>Ofnir and Svafnir</p>
<p>will forever, I think, tear</p>
<p>at the tree’s twigs.</p>
<p>“It is said also that the norns who live beside Urd’s well take water
from it every day, along with some of the surrounding clay, and pour it
over the ash tree so that its limbs will not wither or decay. The water
is so holy that whatever comes into contact with it becomes as white as
the skin that lines the inside of an eggshell. As Völuspá puts it
here,</p>
<p>There stands an Ash,</p>
<p>Yggdrasil by name,</p>
<p>a tall tree, sprinkled</p>
<p>with moist, white soil;</p>
<p>from it come the dews</p>
<p>that fall in the dales;</p>
<p>evergreen, the Ash stands</p>
<p>above the well of Urd.</p>
<p>The dew which falls from the tree to the earth is known among men as
honeydew and bees feed on it. Two birds feed in Urd’s well. They are
called swans, and all the birds of that species are descended from
them.”</p>
