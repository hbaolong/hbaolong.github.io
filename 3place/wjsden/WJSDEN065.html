<h4 id="viking-raids-on-england-7898501">39. Viking Raids on England,
789–850/1</h4>
<p>One of the most important sources for this period is the Anglo-Saxon
Chronicle, which records the annals of England from 60 BCE until 1154
CE. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is not the title of a single document, but
refers collectively to a group of nine manuscripts, none of which is the
original copy. The following translation relies mainly on the version
known as the Peterborough Chronicle. This selection covers the period
from the first appearance of Vikings off the south coast of England to
the year 851, in which the “great army” of the Danes wintered in England
instead of heading back home. Dates in the chronicle are often out by
one or more years. Correct dates are supplied in brackets.</p>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from David Dumville and Simon Keynes,
general eds., The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle: A Collaborative Edition
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 1983–), vol. 7; MS E, ed. Susan Irvine
(Cambridge: D.S. Brewer, 2004), pp. 41–46.</p>
<p>787 [789]. This year, King Beorhtric [of Wessex] married Eadburg,
Offa’s daughter. And in his days there came for the first time three
ships of Northmen, from Hordaland [in Norway]. Then the Reeve rode to
meet them; he intended to have them go to the king’s town because he did
not know what they were. They killed him. These were the first Danish
ships to attack the land of the English people….</p>
<ol start="793" type="1">
<li>In this year, terrifying omens appeared over Northumbria, and the
people were wretchedly afraid. There were huge flashes of lightning and
fiery dragons were seen flying in the air. A great famine followed these
signs, and shortly after that, on the sixth day before the Ides of
January of the same year [8 January], the miserable raiding of the
heathens destroyed God’s church on the Isle of Lindisfarne through
plundering and murder. Also, Sicga [a Northumbrian nobleman] died on the
seventh day before the Calends of March [23 February].</li>
</ol>
<p>794 [796]. In this year, Pope Hadrian and King Offa [of Mercia] died.
King Athelred of Northumbria was killed by his own people on the
thirteenth day before the Calends of May [19 April]. Also, the bishops
Ceolwulf and Eadbald left the country. Ecgferth succeeded to the kingdom
of Mercia and died the same year. Eadbriht came to power in Kent; his
other name was Præn. Athelheard the alderman died on the Calends of
August [1 August]. The heathens raided in Northumbria and plundered
Ecgferth’s monastery at Jarrow. And there one of their leaders was
killed. Also, some of their ships were wrecked in a storm, and many of
them drowned. Some of them got to the river bank alive; they were
promptly killed at the mouth of the river….</p>
<p>832 [835]. In this year, heathen men ravaged Sheppey.</p>
<p>833 [836]. In this year, King Ecgbriht [of Wessex] fought against the
men from twenty-five ships at Carhampton. After great slaughter the
Danes were left in possession of the battlefield. Hereferth and
Wigferth, two bishops, died as did the aldermen Duda and Osmod.</p>
<p>835 [838]. This year, a great Danish fleet came to the West Welsh
[Cornishmen]. The Welsh and the Danes joined forces and began fighting
against Ecgbriht, king of the West Saxons. He moved against them and
fought them at Hingston. There he put to flight both the Welsh and the
Danes.</p>
<p>837 [840]. This year, Alderman Wulfheard fought against the men from
thirty-three ships at Southampton. He slaughtered a great number and won
the victory, but he died the same year. Alderman Athelhelm fought the
Danes at Portland in Dorset. The alderman was slain and the Danes won
control of the battlefield.</p>
<p>839 [842]. In this year, there was much slaughter in London,
Canterbury, and Rochester.</p>
<p>840 [843]. This year, King Athelwulf fought the men from thirty-five
ships at Carhampton, and the Danes won possession of the
battlefield.</p>
<p>845 [848]. In this year, Alderman Ceorl with the men of Somerset,
Bishop Ealhstan, and Osric with the men of Dorset fought the Danes at
the mouth of the Parret and won the battle there with great
slaughter.</p>
<p>851 [850 or 851]. In this year, Alderman Ceorl and the men of
Devonshire fought against heathens and, after huge slaughter, defeated
them. The heathens stayed in Thanet over the winter. The same year,
three hundred and fifty ships arrived at the mouth of the Thames. The
heathens stormed Canterbury and routed Brihtwulf, king of the Mercians,
and his army. Next, the heathens went south across the Thames where King
Athelwulf [of Wessex] and Athelwulf his son with the West-Saxon host
fought them at Oakley. This battle was the greatest massacre of a
heathen army we have ever heard tell of. King Athelwulf and his forces
were victorious there. That same year, King Athelstan and Alderman
Ealhere fought in their ships and massacred a large heathen force at
Sandwich. They captured nine ships and drove off the rest.</p>
