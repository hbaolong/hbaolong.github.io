<h4 id="c-a-throwing-game-from-bards-saga-aaaaaaaa">(c) A Throwing Game
from Bard’s Saga AAAAAAAA</h4>
<p>Source: trans. A.A. Somerville, from Bárðar saga, in Harðar saga,
ed. Þórhallur Vilmundarson and Bjarni Vilhjálmsson, Íslenzk fornrit XIII
(Reykjavík, 1991), pp. 142–45.</p>
<ol start="13" type="1">
<li>In those days, Hit the troll-woman was still alive and her home was
at Hundahellir [Dogs’ Cave] in the valley now known as Hitardal. Hit
planned a big Yule-feast. First of all she invited Bard Snaefell’s As;
along with him came his son, Gest, and Thorkel Skinnvefja. Also invited
were Gudrun Knapekkja and Kalf her son, Surt of Hellisfitjar, and Jora
from Jorukleif. The giant Kolbjorn was invited too; he lived in a cave
at Breiddalsbotnar, near Brattagil, which is at the southern end of
Hrutafjardardal, where the valley becomes wide and shallow to the west
of Slettafell. Kolbjorn came with Gapi and Gljufra-Geir, who lived at
Havagnup in Gnupsdal. Glam and Amr from Midfjordsness came too, as did
Gudlaug from Gudlaug’s Head.</li>
</ol>
<p>The seating at Hundahellir was arranged as follows. In the middle of
the cross-bench sat Gudrun Knappekkja; on one side of her sat Egil’s
daughter, Jora, from Jorukleif and on the other side sat Bard’s
daughter, Helga; no others are mentioned by name. Hit herself waited on
her guests. Bard Snaefell’s As sat in the high-seat on one of the long
side-benches. On one side of him sat Gudlaug from Gudlaug’s Head, and on
the other side sat Gest Bardarson, then Kalf and Thorkel Skinnvefja.
Opposite Bard sat Surt from Fitjar. On one side of him sat Kolbjorn from
Breidsdal, then Glam and Am, and on the other side sat Geir and
Gapi.</p>
<p>The tables were set up and splendid food was served. There was a
great deal of heavy drinking and everyone got drunk. After the meal, Hit
and the giants asked Bard what sort of entertainment he would like; they
told him that everyone would go along with his decision. Bard asked for
the skin-throwing game. Then Bard, Surt, Kolbjorn, Gudlaug, and
Gljufra-Geir all stood up to play the game. There was a lot of pushing
and shoving, but Bard was obviously the strongest, even though he was an
old man. They used a large bear-hide as the skin. They made it into a
bundle and four of them began throwing it from one to the other. The
fifth was ‘it’ and had to try and get hold of the skin. It was a bad
idea to get in the way of their kicking and shoving, so most people
stood up on the benches. But not Gest: he sat quietly in his place. When
Kolbjorn was ‘it’, he sprang forward quickly and tried to seize the skin
from Bard. Seeing this, Gest stuck out his foot in front of Kolbjorn who
fell on the rock floor so hard that his nose was broken and blood gushed
all over him. There followed a ferocious riot of kicking and shoving
because Kolbjorn wanted to get his own back on Gest.</p>
<p>Bard said that no one should make trouble in the home of his friend,
Hit. “Especially,” he said, “when she has invited us out of
affection.”</p>
<p>Bard’s wishes were respected, though Kolbjorn took it badly that he
did not get his revenge. Everyone now went home. It seemed, as it often
had before, that all the giants were afraid of Bard.</p>
<p>When they parted, Hit gave Gest a great big dog with a gray face
called Snati. He was a very useful dog because of his strength and
intelligence. Hit said that he would be more help in a fight than four
brave men. Then Bard went home, and he and Gest stayed there for some
time.</p>
