<h4 id="adam-of-bremen-on-iceland">71. Adam of Bremen on Iceland</h4>
<p>Adam of Bremen included a description of Iceland among the islands of
the North discussed in Book Four of his late-eleventh-century History of
the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen.</p>
<p>Source: trans. F.J. Tschan, Adam of Bremen, History of the
Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen, with new introduction by T. Reuter (New
York: Columbia University Press, 2002), pp. 216–18.</p>
<p>Book Four: A Description of the Islands of the North</p>
<ol start="35" type="1">
<li>“The island Thule, which, separated from the others by endless
stretches, is situated far off in the midst of the ocean, is,” they say,
“barely known.” About it Roman writers as well as barbarians report much
that is worth repeating. “The farthest island of all,” they say, “is
Thule, in which there is no night at the summer solstice, when the sun
crosses the sign of Cancer; and likewise, no day at the winter solstice.
This they think, takes place every six months.” Bede [Anglo-Saxon,
eighth century] also writes that the bright summer nights in Britain
indicate without a doubt that at the solstice it is continuously day for
six months and, on the contrary, night in the wintertime, when the sun
is withdrawn. And Pytheas of Marseilles [Greek explorer, ca 300 BCE]
writes that this happens on the island of Thule, six days’ sail distant
from Britain toward the north. This Thule is now called Iceland, from
the ice which binds the ocean. About this island they also report this
remarkable fact, that the ice on account of its age is so black and dry
in appearance that it burns when fire is set to it. This island,
however, is so very large that it has on it many peoples, who make a
living only by raising cattle and who clothe themselves with their
pelts. No crops are grown there; the supply of wood is very meager. On
this account the people dwell in underground caves, glad to have roof
and food and bed in common with their cattle. Passing their lives thus
in holy simplicity, because they seek nothing more than what nature
affords, they can joyfully say with the Apostle: “But having food, and
wherewith to be covered, with these we are content.” For instead of
towns they have mountains and springs as their delights. Blessed, I say,
is the folk whose poverty no one envies; and in this respect most
blessed because all have now adopted Christianity. They have many
meritorious customs, especially charity, in consequence of which they
have all things in common with strangers as well as with natives. They
hold their bishop as king. All the people respect his wishes. They hold
as law whatever he ordains as coming from God, or from the Scriptures,
or even from the worthy practices of other peoples. For them our
metropolitan returned vast thanks to God that they had been converted in
his time, even though before receiving the faith they were in what may
be called their natural law, which was not much of accord with our
religion. On their petition, therefore, the archbishop consecrated a
certain most holy man named Islef [consecrated in 1056]. And when he was
sent from that region to the prelate, the latter held him in his company
for a while and furthermore bestowed great honor upon him. In the
meantime Islef learned in what respects peoples newly converted to
Christ can salutarily be instructed. By him the archbishop transmitted
letters to the people of Iceland and Greenland, reverently greeting
their churches and promising them he would come to them very soon that
their joy may be full together. From these words the high purpose which
the archbishop had with regard to his legateship can be adduced as,
indeed, we also learn the Apostle wished to journey to Spain in order to
preach the Word of God, which intention he was unable to carry out.
Disregarding the fabulous, these facts about Iceland and the farthest
Thule we learned are true.</li>
