<h4 id="ireland">25 IRELAND</h4>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN SPENT HIS first two weeks in Ireland living at Ross’s
Hotel in Dublin. Whenever Drury was free from hospital duties he and
Wittgenstein went together to look at possible lodgings in or around
Dublin. None could offer the solitariness and peace that was required,
but the problem was temporarily solved by a friend of Drury’s at St
Patrick’s, Robert McCullough. McCullough had been in the habit of
spending his holidays at a farmhouse at Red Cross, in County Wicklow,
which belonged to Richard and Jenny Kingston, and they had told him they
were prepared to take in a permanent guest. This information was passed
on to Wittgenstein, who immediately set off from Dublin to ‘case the
joint’ (by this time, his vocabulary contained a liberal sprinkling of
phrases borrowed from American detective fiction). He was enchanted by
Wicklow. ‘On my journey down in the bus’, he told Drury on his return,
‘I kept remarking to myself what a really beautiful country this
is.’</p>
<p>Soon after moving into the Kingstons’ farmhouse, however, he wrote to
Rhees saying he felt ‘cold and uncomfortable’ there: ‘I may, in a couple
of months, move to a much more isolated place in the West of Ireland.’1
But after a few weeks he became much more acclimatized, and on Drury’s
first visit to Red Cross all seemed to be going well. Wittgenstein told
him: ‘Sometimes my ideas come so quickly that I feel as if my pen was
being guided.2 I now see clearly that it was the right thing for me to
give up the professorship. I could never have got this work done while I
was in Cambridge.’</p>
<p>Being away from the ‘disintegrating and putrefying English
civilization’ that Cambridge represented was undoubtedly one of the
chief attractions of living in Ireland. When von Wright wrote to him
about his hesitation in applying for the Cambridge Chair in Philosophy,
Wittgenstein replied that he understood perfectly, and in fact had
assumed von Wright would not apply, for: ‘the prospect of becoming
English, or a refugee in England, seemed to me anything but attractive
in our time’.3</p>
<p>When von Wright finally did apply, Wittgenstein’s encouragement was
tempered by a fearful warning:</p>
<p>Cambridge is a dangerous place. Will you become superficial? smooth?
If you don’t you will have to suffer terribly.4 – The passage in your
letter which makes me feel particularly uneasy is the one about your
feeling enthusiasm at the thought of teaching at Cambridge. It seems to
me: if you go to Cambridge you must go as a SOBER man. May my fears have
no foundation, and may you not be tempted beyond your powers!</p>
<p>Apart from not being in Cambridge, the chief attraction of living at
Red Cross was the beauty of the Wicklow countryside. The winter was
mild, and Wittgenstein could go for a walk almost every day. ‘There is
nothing like the Welsh coast here’, he wrote to Rhees, ’but the colours
are most wonderful andandandand make up for everything.’5 And to his
sister, Helene, he wrote:</p>
<p>The country here would not have so many attractions for me if the
colours were not often so wonderful.6 I think it must be to do with the
atmosphere, for not only the grass, but also the sky, the sea and even
everything that is brown are all magnificent. – I feel a good deal
better here than in Cambridge.</p>
<p>He took his notebook with him on his walks around Red Cross, and
would often work outdoors. A neighbour of the Kingstons’, who often saw
Wittgenstein out on his favourite walk, reports that he once passed him
sitting in a ditch, writing furiously, oblivious of anything going on
around him. This is presumably one of those occasions when, as he told
Drury, his ideas came so quickly that he felt as if his pen were being
guided. He was, however, cautious in attributing too much importance to
these moods of inspiration:</p>
<p>In a letter (to Goethe I think) Schiller writes of a ‘poetic mood’. I
think I know what he means, I believe I am familiar with it myself.7 It
is a mood of receptivity to nature in which one’s thoughts seem as vivid
as nature itself. But it is strange that Schiller did not produce
anything better (or so it seems to me) and so I am not entirely
convinced that what I produce in such a mood is really worth anything.
It may be that what gives my thoughts their lustre on these occasions is
a light shining on them from behind. That they do not themselves
glow.</p>
<p>He had taken with him both the typescript that is now Philosophical
Investigations, Part I, and that which is now Remarks on the Philosophy
of Psychology, Volume I. From these – together with the remarks he was
writing at Red Cross – he hoped to put together a final version of the
first part of his book. (The second part – that dealing with the
philosophy of mathematics – could by now be considered an abandoned
project.) He reported to all his friends that the work was going fairly
well. There is, however, some indication that he was already inclined to
leave the task of publishing to his literary executors. ‘Heaven knows if
I’ll ever publish this work’, he wrote to von Wright, ‘but I should like
you to look at it after my death if you survive me.8 There is a good
deal of hard thinking in it.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was prevented from working as hard as he would have
liked by ill health. Despite claiming to Rhees, on 5 February 1948,
that: ‘I am in very good bodily health’, he was in fact suffering from
painful attacks of indigestion.9 To combat this he would keep by his
side as he worked a tin of ‘Scragg’s’ charcoal biscuits. He had so much
faith in this remedy (the Kingstons’ children, Maude and Ken, remember
him eating very little else) that he would frequently have to walk to
Arklow to replenish his stock. The biscuits, however, did not appear to
solve the problem: ‘My work’s going moderately well’, he wrote to
Malcolm in January, ’andandandand I think it might even go very well if
I weren’t suffering from some kind of indigestion which I don’t seem to
be able to shake off.’10</p>
<p>Far worse (but perhaps in some way linked to his poor digestion) was
his deteriorating nervous condition. On 3 February he wrote:</p>
<p>Feel unwell. Not physically, but mentally.11 Am frightened of the
onset of insanity. God alone knows whether I am in danger.</p>
<p>If the nearness of Ben had been the cause of his mental instability
during his last year at Cambridge, absence from him made him no more
sane. On 5 February he reported to Malcolm: ‘occasionally queer states
of nervous instability about which I’ll only say that they’re rotten
while they last andandandand teach one to pray’.12 And on the same day
he wrote to Rhees:</p>
<p>My nerves, I’m afraid, often misbehave.13 Of course they’re tired and
old nerves. – My work, on the whole, goes fairly well. Again it’s the
work of an old man: for, though I am not really old, I have, somehow, an
old soul. May it be granted to me that my body doesn’t survive my
soul!</p>
<p>‘I often believe that I am on the straight road to insanity’, he told
von Wright a month later.14 ‘It is difficult for me to imagine that my
brain should stand the strain very long.’</p>
<p>He spent the following two weeks in a state of acute depression,
unable to work and increasingly dissatisfied with his accommodation. He
had originally been pleased with his hosts. ‘They are very quiet’, he
had written to von Wright in December.15 ‘I have my meals in my room and
am very little disturbed.’ But in March, Ken, the youngest of the family
(he was then eleven years old), had a friend to stay. The two of them
shared a bedroom, and would be up late at night talking and laughing
together. When Wittgenstein banged furiously on the wall to tell them to
be quiet, they took it as a joke. But Wittgenstein was truly at his
wits’ end. He sent a telegram to Drury in Dublin asking him to book a
room at Ross’s Hotel and to come and see him there, as a matter of
urgency. Drury recalls: ‘As soon as he had arrived I went down to see
him.16 He looked distressed and agitated’:</p>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN: It has come.</p>
<p>DRURY: I don’t understand; what has happened?</p>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN: What I have always dreaded: that I would no longer be
able to work. I have done no work at all for the past two weeks. And I
can’t sleep at nights. The people under my room sit up late talking and
the continual murmur of voices is driving me crazy.</p>
<p>Drury prescribed some tablets to help Wittgenstein sleep, and told
him that his brother’s cottage on the west coast of Ireland was now
empty, and that Wittgenstein was welcome to make use of it. There, at
least, he would find peace and solitude.</p>
<p>Relieved, Wittgenstein returned to Red Cross to think it over. He
spent Easter with the Kingstons, but was still unable to work, and
therefore resolved to take up Drury’s offer. His state of mind, however,
improved considerably – as did his relations with the Kingstons – and
shortly before he left he presented the children with a big, bright
green Easter egg full of chocolates; on the day he left for the west
coast, 28 April, he signed the visitors’ book with the remark: ‘Thank
you for a very good time.’</p>
<p>There is no reason to see in the remark any irony or insincerity – it
was no doubt a genuine expression of gratitude to the Kingstons. But the
last two months, at least, of his stay at Red Cross could hardly be
called ‘a very good time’, as is shown by the letter he wrote Rhees a
week before he left:</p>
<p>I often thought of you these days andandandand, although this may
sound awful, often thought; thank God I wrote to you not to come to see
me at Easter.17 For the last 6 or 8 weeks have been a bad time for me.
First I suffered terrible depressions, then I had a bad flu,
andandandand all the time I didn’t know where to go from here. I am now
gradually getting better andandandand I intend leaving here next week
andandandand so go to Rosro in the West. This has great disadvantages
(it’s a 10 hours journey from Dublin) but there’s nothing else I can do,
so far as I can see. So, had you come, you’d have found me in a state of
great tribulation. Wish me some strength, some courage, andandandand
luck! During the last month my work has hardly progressed at all,
andandandand only in the last few days I’ve been able to think a little
(I mean about philosophy; for my brain, though dull, wasn’t inactive, I
wish it had been!).</p>
<p>Wittgenstein knew Rosro, the cottage in Connemara, from 1934, when he
had spent a holiday there in the company of Francis Skinner and Maurice
Drury. It stands facing the sea at the mouth of the Killary harbour, and
the countryside around it is dominated by a range of mountains with
peaks of extraordinary angularity, known as ‘The Twelve Pins’. The
cottage was built as a coastguard station, but fell into disuse after
the First World War. During the early 1920s it remained unoccupied, used
only by the IRA as a place to hide prisoners until, in 1927, it was
bought by Maurice Drury’s brother, Miles, as a holiday cottage. There
are a few neighbouring cottages, but it is many miles away from any
shop, post office or any other village or town amenity. This isolation,
though it had, as Wittgenstein anticipated, ‘great disadvantages’, was
necessary if he were to enjoy the freedom from interruption he thought
essential for his work.</p>
<p>On his arrival there Wittgenstein was met by Thomas Mulkerrins
(‘Tommy’, as Wittgenstein, like everybody else in Killary, learnt to
call him), an employee of the Drury family, who lived in a tiny cottage
about half a mile away from Rosro and who was paid £3 a week to look
after the Drurys’ holiday home. (He supplemented this inconsiderable
wage by gathering peat and fishing for mackerel.) Tommy had been told by
Drury that Wittgenstein had suffered a nervous breakdown, and had been
asked to help in whatever way he could. So every morning he walked down
to Rosro to deliver milk and peat, and to check that Wittgenstein was
all right. Wittgenstein found him (so he told Malcolm): ‘quite nice
andandandand certainly better company than the people I stayed with in
Co Wicklow’.18</p>
<p>In conversation with Rhees, later, he was more critical, describing
the whole Mulkerrins family as people ill disposed to do any work. He
was shocked to see that Tommy’s mother, though an excellent sempstress,
went about in rags, and that though Tommy himself was a competent
carpenter every chair in their cottage had a broken leg. In his diary,
Tommy – ‘the man upon whom I am totally dependent here’ – is described
simply as ‘unreliable’.19</p>
<p>Unreliable or not, Tommy was all he had. His immediate neighbours,
the Mortimer family, considered him completely mad, and would have
nothing to do with him. They even forbade him to walk on their land, on
the grounds that he would frighten their sheep. He therefore had to take
a long and circuitous route along the road if he wanted to walk on the
hills behind Rosro. On one of these walks, the Mortimers saw him stop
suddenly and, using his walking-stick as an implement, draw an outline
figure (a duck-rabbit?) in the dirt on the track, which he stood staring
at in complete absorption for a long time before resuming his walk. This
confirmed their original assessment. So, too, did Wittgenstein’s
vehement outburst one night when the barking of the Mortimers’ dog
disturbed his concentration. He appeared to the Mortimers, in fact, in
much the same way that he had earlier appeared to the villagers of rural
Austria.</p>
<p>Tommy, too, thought Wittgenstein a little odd. But partly because of
his loyalty to the Drury family (Miles Drury had once dived off a boat
to save Tommy from drowning), and partly because he came to enjoy the
company of ‘the Professor’, he was prepared to do what he could to make
Wittgenstein’s stay at Rosro as comfortable and as enjoyable as
possible. He did his best, for example, to satisfy Wittgenstein’s strict
standards of cleanliness and hygiene. At Wittgenstein’s suggestion, he
brought with him every morning, not only the milk and peat, but also his
own used tea-leaves. Every morning the leaves were sprinkled on the
kitchen floor to absorb the dirt, and were then swept up. Tommy was also
called upon to rid the cottage of ‘slaters’ (wood-lice). This he did by
showering the whole cottage with a suffocating amount of disinfectant
powder. Wittgenstein, who throughout his life had a dread of bugs of any
kind, was pleased with the result, preferring the threat of suffocation
to the sight of wood-lice.</p>
<p>Rosro cottage had two rooms, a bedroom and a kitchen, and it was in
the latter that Wittgenstein spent most of his time. He did not,
however, use the kitchen to prepare his meals. While at Rosro he lived
almost entirely on tinned food ordered from a grocer’s shop in Galway.
Tommy was concerned about this diet. ‘Tinned food will be the death of
you’, he once said.20 ‘People live too long anyway’, came the grim
reply. Instead, Wittgenstein used the kitchen as a study, and when Tommy
came in the morning he would often find him sitting at the kitchen table
writing on to loose sheets of paper clipped together. Almost every day
there would be a pile of rejected sheets, which it was Tommy’s job to
burn.</p>
<p>One morning when Tommy arrived at Rosro, he heard Wittgenstein’s
voice and, on entering the cottage, was surprised to find ‘the
Professor’ alone. ‘I thought you had company’, he said. ‘I did’,
Wittgenstein answered.21 ‘I was talking to a very dear friend of mine –
myself.’ The remark is echoed in one of his notebooks of the period:</p>
<p>Nearly all my writings are private conversations with myself. Things
that I say to myself tête-à-tête.22</p>
<p>Apart from the time he spent with Tommy, Wittgenstein’s solitude at
Rosro was interrupted only by a brief visit from Ben Richards, who spent
a couple of weeks there in the summer of 1948. Together they went on
Wittgenstein’s favourite walks up the hills and along the coast,
admiring the magnificently varied flora and fauna of the area.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had taken a particular interest in the different kinds
of birds that are to be seen at Killary. (Northern Divers, Cormorants,
Curlews, Oyster Catchers, Puffins and Terns are all fairly common along
that part of the west Ireland coast.) At first he used to ask Tommy to
identify the birds for him. He would describe a bird he had seen, and
Tommy would do his best to name it, although, as he freely admits:
‘maybe it wasn’t always the right name I gave him’. Having caught him
out a few times, Wittgenstein relied instead on the illustrated
handbooks sent to him by Drury.</p>
<p>In order to gain a better view of the sea-birds, Wittgenstein wanted
to build a hut on one of the small islands off the Killary coast. He was
eventually dissuaded from this by Tommy (whose job it would have been to
construct it) on the grounds that a small wooden hut would not be strong
enough to withstand the exposed conditions on the island. Instead, Tommy
took Wittgenstein out in a rowing-boat; while Tommy rowed, Wittgenstein
would either look out for sea-birds or sit silently in contemplation.
Occasionally, while out in the boat, they would chat, Wittgenstein
reminiscing about his time in Norway, when he would have to row across
the fjord to fetch his supplies, and Tommy answering Wittgenstein’s
questions about the history of Killary.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein took an interest, too, in the more domestic birds, the
robins and chaffinches, that used to come to the cottage in search of
crumbs. He would encourage them by leaving food out for them, and
eventually they grew so tame that they would come to him at the kitchen
window, and eat off his hand. When he left Rosro he gave Tommy some
money with which to buy food to provide for the birds, who had now come
to expect a daily feed. By the time Tommy next visited the cottage,
however, he found the birds’ tameness had been their undoing. While
waiting by the window to be fed, they had fallen easy prey to the local
cats.</p>
<p>The way of life at Rosro, though strenuous, seems to have provided
the necessary conditions for an improvement in Wittgenstein’s mental and
physical well-being. He had, as we have seen, arrived there in poor
shape. ‘I’ve had a bad time lately: soul, mind andandandand body’, he
wrote to Malcolm on 30 April, a few days after he arrived.23 ‘I felt
exceedingly depressed for many weeks, then felt ill andandandand now I’m
weak andandandand completely dull. I haven’t done any work for 5–6
weeks.’ But within a month, the solitude of the cottage, the beauty of
the coastal scenery, the company of the birds and Tommy Mulkerrins’s
good-humoured (if not entirely dependable) support had effected a change
for the better. Wittgenstein found himself once again able to work.</p>
<p>His biggest complaint about the way of life there was that he had to
do all his own housework. This he found an infuriating nuisance, but, as
he wrote to Malcolm’s wife, Lee, ‘it’s undoubtedly a great blessing,
too, because it keeps me sane, it forces me to live a regular life
andandandand is in general good for me although I curse it every
day’.24</p>
<p>The remoteness of Rosro was a problem only in so far as the scarcity
of American pulp fiction was concerned. The nearest village was ten
miles away, and the selection of books to be had there was so poor that,
in the periods between his regular parcels of ‘mags’ from Norman
Malcolm, Wittgenstein was forced to resort to reading Dorothy Sayers.
This, he told Malcolm, ‘was so bl … foul that it depressed me’.
Malcolm’s supply of the ‘real thing’ came as a relief: ‘when I opened
one of your mags it was like getting out of a stuffy room into the fresh
air’.</p>
<p>By chance, however, he did manage to find at the village shop a
paperback copy of his favourite detective novel, Rendezvous with Fear by
Norbert Davis. He had read Davis’s book during his last year at
Cambridge, and had enjoyed it so much that he lent it to both Moore and
Smythies (he later gave a copy to Ben Richards as well). Seeing it
again, he couldn’t resist the temptation to buy it and reread it, and
having done so his regard for it increased even further: ‘For though, as
you know’, he wrote to Malcolm, ’I’ve read hundreds of stories that
amused me andandandand that I liked reading, I think I’ve only read two
perhaps that I’d call good stuff, andandandand Davis’s is one of
them.’25 He asked Malcolm to try to find out more about Davis:</p>
<p>It may sound crazy, but when I recently re-read the story I liked it
again so much that I thought I’d really like to write to the author and
thank him. If this is nuts don’t be surprised, for so am I.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Malcolm reports: ‘As I recall, I was unable to obtain
any information about this author.’26 This is a pity, because by 1948
Norbert Davis was, in fact, in sore need of encouragement. He was, along
with Dashiell Hammett and other Black Mask writers, one of the pioneers
of the American ‘hard-boiled’ detective story. In the early 1930s he had
given up a career as a lawyer to write detective stories, and then
enjoyed ten years as a successful author. By the late 1940s, however, he
had fallen on hard times. Shortly after Wittgenstein’s letter to
Malcolm, Davis wrote to Raymond Chandler saying that fourteen of his
last fifteen stories had been rejected for publication, and asking
Chandler to lend him 00.27 He died in poverty the following year,
unaware of his rare (probably unique) distinction in having written a
book which Wittgenstein liked sufficiently to want to write a letter of
thanks to its author.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s gratitude is, no doubt, partly accounted for by the
scarcity of detective fiction in Connemara. But why should he have rated
Rendezvous with Fear above all the other detective stories he had read
(of which there was a great number)?</p>
<p>The answer perhaps lies in the humour of the novel, which is in fact
its most striking feature. The detective in the story, Doan, is
distinguished from such figures as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe by his
rather comically unprepossessing appearance: he is a short, fat man who
is followed everywhere by an enormous, well-trained Great Dane called
Carstairs. The feature of Davis’s style that particularly impressed
Raymond Chandler was the casual way in which he killed off his
characters, and this is particularly evident in Rendezvous with Fear.
For example, after setting the scene by describing the tourists at the
Azteca, a hotel in South America, Davis introduces ‘Garcia’:</p>
<p>All this was very boring to a man who, for the time being, was named
Garcia.28 He sat and drank beer the general colour and consistency of
warm vinegar, and glowered. He had a thin, yellowish face and a
straggling black moustache, and he was cross-eyed. He should really have
been more interested in the tourists coming from the Hotel Azteca,
because in a short time one of them was going to shoot him dead.
However, he didn’t know that, and had you told him he would have
laughed. He was a bad man.</p>
<p>When Doan shoots Bautiste Bonofile, another ‘bad man’, the romantic
but naïve heroine, Jane, asks with concern: ‘Is he hurt?’ ‘Not a bit’,
says Doan, ’he’s just dead.’29</p>
<p>‘Humour is not a mood but a way of looking at the world’,
Wittgenstein wrote while he was at Rosro.30 ‘So if it is correct to say
that humour was stamped out in Nazi Germany, that does not mean that
people were not in good spirits, or anything of that sort, but something
much deeper and more important.’ To understand what that ‘something’ is,
it would perhaps be instructive to look at humour as something strange
and incomprehensible:</p>
<p>Two people are laughing together, say at a joke. One of them has used
certain somewhat unusual words and now they both break out into a sort
of bleating. That might appear very extraordinary to a visitor coming
from quite a different environment. Whereas we find it completely
reasonable. (I recently witnessed this scene on a bus and was able to
think myself into the position of someone to whom this would be
unfamiliar. From that point of view it struck me as quite irrational,
like the responses of an outlandish animal.)</p>
<p>Understanding humour, like understanding music, provides an analogy
for Wittgenstein’s conception of philosophical understanding. What is
required for understanding here is not the discovery of facts, nor the
drawing of logically valid inferences from accepted premises – nor,
still less, the construction of theories – but, rather, the right point
of view (from which to ‘see’ the joke, to hear the expression in the
music or to see your way out of the philosophical fog). But how do we
explain or teach what is meant by the ‘right point of view’?</p>
<p>So how do we explain to someone what ‘understanding music’ means? By
specifying the images, kinaesthetic sensations, etc.,31 experienced by
someone who understands? More likely, by drawing attention to his
expressive movements. – And we really ought to ask what function
explanation has here. And what it means to speak of: understanding what
it means to understand music. For some would say: to understand that
means: to understand music itself. And in that case we should have to
ask ‘Well, can someone be taught to understand music?’, for that is the
only sort of teaching that could be called explaining music.</p>
<p>There is a certain expression proper to the appreciation of music, in
listening, playing, and at other times too. Sometimes gestures form part
of this expression, but sometimes it will just be a matter of how a man
plays, or hums, the piece, now and again of the comparisons he draws and
the images with which he as it were illustrates the music. Someone who
understands music will listen differently (e.g. with a different
expression on his face), he will talk differently, from one who does
not. But he will show that he understands a particular theme not just in
manifestations that accompany his hearing or playing that theme but in
his understanding for music in general.</p>
<p>Appreciating music is a manifestation of the life of mankind. How
should we describe it to someone? Well, I suppose we should first have
to describe music. Then we could describe how human beings react to it.
But is that all we need do, or must we also teach him to understand it
for himself? Well, getting him to understand and giving him an
explanation that does not achieve this will be ‘teaching him what
understanding is’ in different senses of that phrase. And again,
teaching him to understand poetry or painting may contribute to teaching
him what is involved in understanding music.</p>
<p>These remarks on understanding music – like those on humour quoted
earlier – have been published in a collection of remarks ‘which do not
belong directly with his philosophical works although they are scattered
amongst the philosophical texts’ (editor’s preface to Culture and
Value). But their connection with Wittgenstein’s philosophical work is
more direct than this would suggest. One of his chief philosophical
preoccupations while he was at Rosro was the problem of aspect-seeing.
To discuss this problem he would often imagine people who were
‘aspect-blind’ (or, as he sometimes put it, ‘gestalt-blind’) – people
who were unable to see something as something. His remarks on what it is
like to be unable to see a joke, or unable to appreciate music, are not
distinct from this philosophical preoccupation; they are part of it.</p>
<p>‘What would a person who is blind towards these aspects be lacking?’
Wittgenstein asks, and replies: ‘It is not absurd to answer: the power
of imagination.’32 But the imagination of individuals, though necessary,
is not sufficient. What is further required for people to be alive to
‘aspects’ (and, therefore, for humour, music, poetry and painting to
mean something) is a culture. The connection between Wittgenstein’s
philosophical concern with aspect-seeing and his cultural concerns is
therefore simple and direct. It is made clear in the following sequence
of remarks (written at Rosro, and, it should be added, occurring in
Wittgenstein’s bona fide philosophical work):</p>
<p>What is lacking to anyone who doesn’t understand the question which
way the letter F is facing, where, for example, to paint a nose on? Or
to anyone who doesn’t find that a word loses something when it is
repeated several times, namely, its meaning; or to someone who doesn’t
find that it then becomes a mere sound?33</p>
<p>We say: ‘At first something like an image was there.’</p>
<p>Is it that such a person is unable to appreciate a sentence, judge
it, the way those who understand it can? Is it that for him the sentence
is not alive (with all that implies)? Is it that the word does not have
an aroma of meaning? And that therefore he will often react differently
to a word than we do? – It might be that way.</p>
<p>But if I hear a tune with understanding, doesn’t something special go
on in me – which does not go on if I hear it without understanding? And
what? – No answer comes; or anything that occurs to me is insipid. I may
indeed say: ‘Now I’ve understood it’, and perhaps talk about it, play
it, compare it with others etc. Signs of understanding may accompany
hearing.</p>
<p>It is wrong to call understanding a process that accompanies hearing.
(Of course its manifestation, expressive playing, cannot be called an
accompaniment of hearing either.)</p>
<p>For how can it be explained what ‘expressive playing’ is? Certainly
not by anything that accompanies the playing. – What is needed for the
explanation? One might say: a culture. – If someone is brought up in a
particular culture – and then reacts to music in such-and-such a way,
you can teach him the use of the phrase ‘expressive playing’.</p>
<p>Seeing aspects, understanding music, poetry, painting and humour, are
reactions that belong to, and can only survive within, a culture, a form
of life:</p>
<p>What is it like for people not to have the same sense of humour? They
do not react properly to each other.34 It’s as though there were a
custom amongst certain people for one person to throw another a ball
which he is supposed to catch and throw back; but some people, instead
of throwing it back, put it in their pocket.</p>
<p>Thus, if it is true that humour was stamped out in Nazi Germany, this
would mean, not just that people were not in good spirits, but that the
Nazis had been successful in destroying a whole way of life, a way of
looking at the world and the set of reactions and customs that go with
it. (It would mean that the Nazis had, so to speak, pocketed the
ball.)</p>
<p>The philosophical difficulty about aspect-seeing arises from the
prima facie, and puzzling, fact that, though the aspect changes, the
thing that is seen does not; the same drawing is now a duck, and now a
rabbit. Likewise, it is the same joke, poem, painting or piece of music
that is now just an extraordinary, outlandish piece of behaviour, words
on a page, splashes on canvas or an incoherent noise, and now (when it
is understood) funny, moving, beautiful or wonderfully expressive: ’What
is incomprehensible is that nothing, and yet everything, has
changed.’35</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s remark about philosophy – that it ‘leaves everything
as it is’ – is often quoted. But it is less often realized that, in
seeking to change nothing but the way we look at things, Wittgenstein
was attempting to change everything.36 His pessimism about the
effectiveness of his work is related to his conviction that the way we
look at things is determined, not by our philosophical beliefs, but by
our culture, by the way we are brought up. And in the face of this, as
he once said to Karl Britton: ‘What can one man do alone?’</p>
<p>Tradition is not something a man can learn; not a thread he can pick
up when he feels like it; any more than a man can choose his own
ancestors.37</p>
<p>Someone lacking a tradition who would like to have one is like a man
unhappily in love.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had a tradition – one that he loved dearly: the
German/Austrian literature, art and (especially) music of the nineteenth
century. But he was acutely aware that, for the greater part of his
life, this tradition was no longer alive. In this sense, he was not so
much unhappily in love, as desperately bereaved. The physical isolation
at Connemara that he felt necessary to pursue his work matches the sense
of cultural isolation that pervades it.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Wittgenstein stayed at Rosro throughout the summer of 1948, from May
to August. During these four months he wrote a great deal. But the
demands of the life-style and his uncertain health combined to make him
feel too weak to accomplish what he had set out to achieve. ‘I get
tired, bodily and mentally, very easily’, he told von Wright.38 He was,
he wrote in his diary, ‘too soft, too weak, and so too lazy to achieve
anything significant’:39</p>
<p>The industry of great men is, among other things, a sign of their
strength, quite apart from their inner wealth.</p>
<p>He was, in addition, plagued by attacks of melancholy that he was
inclined to personify, as though haunted by a ghost. ‘Don’t let grief
vex you’, he wrote on 29 June:40</p>
<p>You should let it into your heart. Nor should you be afraid of
madness. It comes to you perhaps as a friend and not as an enemy, and
the only thing that is bad is your resistance. Let grief into your
heart. Don’t lock the door on it. Standing outside the door, in the
mind, it is frightening, but in the heart it is not.</p>
<p>A little later, on 11 July, the ghost is identified:</p>
<p>Think a great deal of the last time with Francis, of my odiousness
towards him.41 I was at that time very unhappy; but with a wicked heart.
I cannot see how I will ever in my life be freed from this guilt.</p>
<p>The psychological and physical strains of living alone in Rosro could
not, he thought, be withstood for much longer. He found it almost
inconceivable that he could stand to spend the winter there. ‘But’, he
wrote on 17 July, ‘I have decided to try and do so’:42</p>
<p>I pray a good deal. But whether in the right spirit I do not know. –
Without the blessings of C and B [Con Drury and Ben] I could not live
here.</p>
<p>He asked Tommy whether he would consider having him as a guest for
the winter. Tommy declined. His tiny, two-room, cottage was already
over-crowded with himself, his mother and his sister. Wittgenstein also
approached Mrs Phillips, the proprietor of nearby Kylemore House (now
Kylemore Hotel), but was told that she took guests only during the
summer. If he was to stay in Connemara, the only option open to him was
to live alone at Rosro.</p>
<p>He left Connemara in August, travelling first to Dublin to visit
Drury, and then to Uxbridge to stay with Ben at his family home. In
September he left for Vienna to visit Hermine, who was seriously ill
with cancer.</p>
<p>On his return he spent a couple of weeks at Cambridge dictating a
typescript compiled from the work he had written in Ireland. This has
now been published as Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volume
II. But, like its predecessor, it was not conceived as a separate work,
its intended – or, perhaps, ostensible – purpose being to provide, in a
convenient form, a set of remarks to use in the revision of the
Investigations.</p>
<p>By 16 October the work was completed, and Wittgenstein returned to
Dublin, intending initially to go on to Rosro. From Vienna he had
written to Tommy, asking him to have the cottage ready for his return.
He had, however, as we have seen, serious misgivings about returning.
And as Wittgenstein’s doctor, Drury, too, was concerned about his
spending the winter in a place where, if he fell ill, there would be no
one to look after him, and no way of getting him medical attention.
Moreover, Wittgenstein found that in the warm, comfortable, and above
all quiet room that he occupied at the top of the Dublin hotel in which
he was staying, he could work quite well. In the event, therefore, he
spent the winter as a guest at Ross’s Hotel.</p>
<p>Ross’s Hotel was, in 1948, a large but not especially luxurious hotel
on Parkgate Street, close to Phoenix Park. (It still stands, but is now
extensively altered and has been renamed the Ashling Hotel.) It was
known locally as a ‘Protestant’ hotel: many of the permanent guests
there were Protestants, and it was used by Protestant clergymen when
they came to Dublin to attend conferences and meetings. ‘When I look at
the faces of the clergy here in Dublin’, Wittgenstein remarked to Drury,
‘it seems to me that the Protestant ministers look less smug than the
Roman priests.43 I suppose it is because they know they are such a small
minority.’</p>
<p>Of more importance to him, however, was the fact that it was only a
short walk away from the Zoological Gardens in Phoenix Park. Through
Drury he became a member of the Royal Zoological Society, which allowed
him free access to the gardens and the right to have his meals in the
members’ room. While he was in Dublin he saw Drury almost every day:
they would meet for lunch either at the members’ room of the Zoological
Gardens or at Bewley’s Café in Grafton Street, where the waitress
quickly became accustomed to Wittgenstein’s unvarying diet, and would
bring him an omelette and coffee without his having to order it. Drury
also introduced him to the Botanical Gardens at Glasnevin, where the
heated Palm House provided a warm and congenial place in which to work
during the winter.</p>
<p>During the winter months in Dublin Wittgenstein worked with great
intensity. ‘I’m anxious to make hay during the very short period when
the sun shines in my brain’, he told Malcolm on 6 November.44 On one
occasion, when he and Drury had planned to have lunch together, Drury
arrived at the hotel to be told: ‘Just wait a minute until I finish
this.’ Wittgenstein then continued to write for two hours without saying
a word.45 When he finally finished he seemed quite unaware that it was
now long past their lunch-time.</p>
<p>The work he wrote in Dublin has been published under the title Last
Writings on the Philosophy of Psychology. The title has misled many into
thinking that it is Wittgenstein’s last work. It is not; it predates,
for example, Part II of Philosophical Investigations, On Certainty and
Remarks on Colour. It is, however, the last of the series of manuscript
volumes, begun in Cambridge in 1946, in which he attempts to provide a
better, more perspicuous, analysis of psychological concepts than that
given in Part I of the Investigations. It is a continuation of his
attempts to exhibit the multiplicity and complexity of psychological
concepts (such as ‘fear’, ‘hope’, ‘belief’ etc.) in a way that exposes
the barrenness and confusion of ‘the philosopher’s search for
generality’. The work is full of fine distinctions, designed to show,
among other things, the danger of assuming that all sentences in the
indicative mode can be regarded as descriptions:</p>
<p>I hear the words ‘I am afraid’. I ask: ’In what connection did you
say that? Was it a sigh from the bottom of your heart, was it a
confession, was it self-observation …?’46</p>
<p>On one of their walks in Phoenix Park, Drury mentioned Hegel. ‘Hegel
seems to me to be always wanting to say that things which look different
are really the same’, Wittgenstein told him.47 ‘Whereas my interest is
in showing that things which look the same are really different.’ He was
thinking of using as a motto for his book the Earl of Kent’s phrase from
King Lear (Act I, scene iv): ‘I’ll teach you differences.’</p>
<p>His concern was to stress life’s irreducible variety. The pleasure he
derived from walking in the Zoological Gardens had much to do with his
admiration for the immense variety of flowers, shrubs and trees and the
multitude of different species of birds, reptiles and animals. A theory
which attempted to impose a single scheme upon all this diversity was,
predictably, anathema to him. Darwin had to be wrong: his theory ‘hasn’t
the necessary multiplicity’.48</p>
<p>The concepts with which Wittgenstein is particularly concerned in
these ‘Last Writings’ are those of ‘thinking’ and ‘seeing’. More
particularly, his concern is with the relation between the two. Of
central importance to his whole later work is the idea that there is a
kind of seeing that is also a kind of thinking (or, at least, a kind of
understanding): the seeing of connections. We see a connection in the
same sense that we see an aspect, or a Gestalt To distinguish this sense
of ‘see’ from that in which we see a physical object, and to describe
the connections and the differences between this sense of ‘see’ and the
concepts of ‘thinking’ and ‘understanding’, is the central task of the
work written at Ross’s Hotel.</p>
<p>‘Now you try and say what is involved in seeing something as
something’, Wittgenstein challenged Drury; ‘it is not easy.49 These
thoughts I am now working on are as hard as granite.’ In reply Drury
quoted James Ward: ‘Denken ist schwer’ (‘Thinking is difficult’), a
response which perhaps prompted the following notebook entry:50</p>
<p>‘Denken ist schwer’ (Ward). What does this really mean? Why is it
difficult? – It is almost like saying ‘Looking is difficult.’ Because
looking intently is difficult. And it’s possible to look intently
without seeing anything, or to keep thinking you see something without
being able to see clearly. Looking can tire you even when you don’t see
anything.</p>
<p>It was on the same day that Wittgenstein remarked to Drury: ‘It is
impossible for me to say one word in my book about all that music has
meant in my life.51 How then can I hope to be understood?’ The work that
he was writing at the time, however, does contain a strong hint of this.
For in drawing attention to the sense of ‘seeing’ (or ‘hearing’), in the
act of which we understand something, the paradigmatic example of music
is never far from his thoughts:</p>
<p>We say that someone has the ‘eye of a painter’ or ‘the ear of a
musician’, but anyone lacking these qualities hardly suffers from a kind
of blindness or deafness.52</p>
<p>We say that someone doesn’t have a ‘musical ear’, and
‘aspect-blindness’ is (in a way) comparable to this inability to
hear.53</p>
<p>The example of understanding music was important to him, not only
because of the immense importance of music in his own life, but also
because it is clear that the meaning of a piece of music cannot be
described by naming anything that the music ‘stands for’. And in this
way: ‘Understanding a sentence is much more akin to understanding a
theme in music than one may think.’</p>
<p>‘I would like it if some day you were able to read what I am writing
now’, Wittgenstein told Drury.54 But the demands of Drury’s job at St
Patrick’s, and his relative lack of acquaintance with the specific
philosophical problems with which Wittgenstein was concerned, forbade
any detailed discussion of Wittgenstein’s work. Indeed, Drury recalls
that it was Wittgenstein’s express decision not to discuss philosophy
with him: ’I think he felt that his own thinking was so much more
developed than mine that there was a danger of swamping me and of my
becoming nothing but a pale echo of himself.’55 Nor did Wittgenstein
read through his current work with Ben Richards, who came to stay with
him at Ross’s Hotel for a week or two in November.</p>
<p>In December, however, Wittgenstein had a chance to discuss his work
in detail, when he was joined at the hotel first by Elizabeth Anscombe,
who stayed for the first two weeks of December, and then by Rush Rhees,
who came to Dublin immediately after Anscombe to spend Christmas with
Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein had already decided that Rhees should be the
executor of his will, and also, perhaps, that Anscombe and Rhees should
be two of his literary executors. In any case, with both of them he read
through the work that he had written in the previous two months, and
discussed his attempts to revise Philosophical Investigations, using
this new material together with some of the remarks contained in the two
typescripts he had prepared in the previous two years.</p>
<p>Rhees left Dublin on the first day of the new year, while
Wittgenstein stayed on at Ross’s Hotel hoping to continue his good run
of work. Early in January, however, he fell ill with a complaint similar
to that which had dogged him during the previous year. He described it
to Malcolm as: ‘some sort of infection of the intestines’.56 ‘Of course
it hasn’t done my work any good’, he added. ‘I had to interrupt it
completely for a week andandandand after that it just crawled along, as
I do when I take a walk these days.’</p>
<p>He felt tired, ill and old. He wondered whether this would be his
last illness. He also felt isolated. ‘Drury, I think, is growing more
and more unfaithful’, he wrote on 29 January.57 ‘He has found friends
with whom he can live more easily.’ His doctor diagnosed him as
suffering from nothing more serious than gastro-enteritis, but he was
inclined to distrust the doctor, and ignored the prescribed treatment.
On 11 February he reported ‘great weakness and pain’. Mining, he had
heard, was dying – ‘a great loss for me and for everyone’.58 She had
many and varied talents, he wrote, that were not exposed to the day, but
hidden: ‘like human innards should be’.</p>
<p>Throughout February he was still able to work, but not with anything
like the intensity and industry of which he had been capable before
Christmas. By the end of March even this limited capacity for work had
deserted him, and for a few months after that he wrote nothing at all.
During this fallow period he read a fair amount. Drury was a member of
the Royal Dublin Society’s library, and used to borrow books from there
on Wittgenstein’s behalf. He recalls that what Wittgenstein generally
wanted to read was history – Macaulay’s Essays Critical and Historical,
Livy’s account of the second Punic War, Morley’s Life of Cromwell,
Ségur’s L’Histoire de Napoléon and Bismarck’s Gedanken und Erinnerungen.
They were, for the most part, books Wittgenstein had read before. In
1937, for example, he had written of the Macaulay essays:</p>
<p>[They] contain many excellent things; but his value judgements about
people are tiresome and superfluous.59 One feels like saying to him:
stop gesticulating! and just say what you have to say.</p>
<p>And in 1942 he had written to Rhees that he was reading Livy’s
account of Hannibal’s invasion of Italy: ‘this interests me immensely’.
A favourite passage (so he told Drury) concerned the incident when,
after the battle of Cannae, Hannibal has the battle-field searched for
the bodies of the two consuls, in order that he could show his respect
for them.</p>
<p>In his present state, he wrote in his diary, he would not try to work
unless it came easily to him: ‘for otherwise, even if I strive, nothing
will come out’.60 At the beginning of March he was again joined at the
hotel by Ben, who stayed for ten days: ‘Nice time.61 Always loving.’ But
even while he enjoyed being with Ben he was conscious of the fact that
he was unwell. He slept badly and was troubled by thoughts of the
future: ‘Do not know how it will turn out.’ A few days after Ben left,
he wrote: ’Often it is as though my soul were dead.’62</p>
<p>His conversations with Drury turned with increasing frequency to
religious subjects. He contrasted Drury’s ‘Greek’ religious ideas with
his own thoughts, which were, he said, ‘one hundred per cent Hebraic’.
Drury had admired Origen’s vision of a final restitution of all things,
a restoration to their former glory of even Satan and the fallen angels,
and commented sadly on its condemnation as a heresy. ‘Of course it was
rejected’, Wittgenstein insisted:63</p>
<p>It would make nonsense of everything else. If what we do now is to
make no difference in the end, then all the seriousness of life is done
away with.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s ‘Hebraic’ conception of religion was, Drury suggested,
based on the sense of awe which one feels throughout the Bible. In
illustration of this he quoted from Malachi: ‘But who may abide the day
of his coming and who shall stand when he appeareth?’ (Mal. 3:2). This
stopped Wittgenstein in his tracks: ‘I think you have just said
something very important. Much more important than you realize.’</p>
<p>Central to Wittgenstein’s ‘Hebraic’ conception of religion (like that
of his favourite English poet, Blake) is the strict separation of
philosophy from religion: ‘If Christianity is the truth then all the
philosophy that is written about it is false.’64 In conversation with
Drury he sharply distinguished the more philosophical St John’s Gospel
from the others: ‘I can’t understand the Fourth Gospel.65 When I read
those long discourses, it seems to me as if a different person is
speaking than in the synoptic Gospels.’</p>
<p>But what of St Paul? In 1937 he had written: ‘The spring which flows
gently and limpidly in the Gospels seems to have froth on it in Paul’s
Epistles.’66 He had then seen in St Paul, in contrast to the humility of
the Gospels, ‘something like pride or anger’. In the Gospels you find
huts; in Paul a church: ‘There all men are equal and God himself is a
man; in Paul there is already something like a hierarchy; honours and
official positions.’ But now, he told Drury, he saw that he had been
wrong: ’It is one and the same religion in both the Gospels and the
Epistles.’67</p>
<p>And yet, within his fundamentally ethical conception of religious
faith, he still found the Pauline doctrine of predestination hard to
embrace. For, like Origen’s teaching, it seems to have the consequence
that: ‘what we do now is to make no difference in the end’. And if this
is so, how can the seriousness of life be upheld?</p>
<p>In 1937 Wittgenstein had characterized the Pauline doctrine as one
that could have arisen only from the most dreadful suffering: ‘It’s less
a theory than a sigh, or a cry.’ At his own ‘level of devoutness’ it
could appear only as ‘ugly nonsense, irreligiousness’:</p>
<p>If it is a good and godly picture, then it is so for someone at a
quite different level, who might use it in his life in a way completely
different from anything that would be possible for me.68</p>
<p>In 1949, he could no longer speak of it as ‘irreligious’. But neither
could he quite see how it could be used as a ‘good and godly
picture’:</p>
<p>Suppose someone were taught: there is a being who, if you do such and
such or live thus and thus, will take you to a place of everlasting
torment after you die; most people end up there, a few get to a place of
everlasting happiness.69 – This being has selected in advance those who
are to go to the good place and, since only those who have lived a
certain sort of life go to the place of torment, he has also arranged in
advance for the rest to live like that.</p>
<p>What might be the effect of such a doctrine? Well, it does not
mention punishment, but rather a sort of natural necessity. And if you
were to present things to anyone in this light, he could only react with
despair or incredulity to such a doctrine.</p>
<p>Teaching it could not constitute an ethical upbringing. If you wanted
to bring someone up ethically while yet teaching him such a doctrine,
you would have to teach it to him after having educated him ethically,
representing it as a sort of incomprehensible mystery.</p>
<p>Though Wittgenstein had, as yet, no medical grounds for thinking so,
he felt that his death might come soon. When Malcolm wrote asking about
his financial situation, he replied that he had enough to live on for
two years: ‘What happens after that time I don’t yet know.70 Maybe I
won’t live that long anyway.’</p>
<p>In April he left for Vienna to visit Mining on her death-bed. He
stayed for three or four weeks, returning to Dublin on 16 May. From
there he wrote to Malcolm that Mining was still alive, but that there
was no hope of her recovering: ‘While I was in Vienna I was hardly able
to write at all.71 I felt so rotten myself.’</p>
<p>Soon after arriving back in Dublin, he went, on Drury’s advice, to
see the Professor of Medicine at Trinity College for a diagnosis of the
intestine trouble and the general feeling of exhaustion that had dogged
him since the beginning of the year. It was suspected that he might have
a growth in his stomach, but after being admitted to hospital for a full
investigation he was told that no such growth showed up on the X-ray,
and the only findings made were that he had an atypical and unexplained
anaemia. He was put on a treatment of iron and liver extract, and
although he still found himself unable to concentrate on philosophy, his
condition gradually improved.</p>
<p>He was anxious to overcome his anaemia quickly for two reasons.
First, because he had at last decided to accept a long-standing
invitation from Norman Malcolm to spend the summer at the Malcolms’ home
in Ithaca, USA (after first insisting in jest that, if he came, Malcolm
was to introduce him to his favourite film star, Betty Hutton). He had
booked a passage on the Queen Mary, sailing on 21 July. The second
reason was that, before he left for America, he wanted to spend a few
weeks in Cambridge preparing a final, polished typescript of the work
with which he had been occupied since 1946.</p>
<p>During his period of recovery he remained in Dublin, and it was
presumably during this time that he prepared the fair manuscript copy of
what is now Philosophical Investigations, Part II. As a restful
diversion from this work, Drury proposed giving him a record-player and
some records of his choice. Wittgenstein declined. It would never do, he
said; it would be like giving him a box of chocolates: ‘I wouldn’t know
when to stop eating.’ On the other hand, Drury himself, he said, ought
to listen to music when he was tired after his work. And so the next
morning he had a radio set delivered to Drury’s rooms. Shortly after
this Drury remarked on the great improvement of recording techniques
evident in the records he heard on the radio. This elicited from
Wittgenstein a typically Spenglerian reflection:</p>
<p>It is so characteristic that, just when the mechanics of reproduction
are so vastly improved, there are fewer and fewer people who know how
the music should be played.72</p>
<p>On 13 June, Drury and Wittgenstein listened together to a radio
discussion between A. J. Ayer and Father Copleston on ‘The Existence of
God’. Ayer, Wittgenstein said, ‘has something to say, but he is
incredibly shallow’.73 Copleston, on the other hand, ‘contributed
nothing at all to the discussion’. To attempt to justify the beliefs of
Christianity with philosophical arguments was entirely to miss the
point.</p>
<p>A week later he left Dublin. One senses that, in packing his large
pile of notebooks, manuscripts and typescripts, he was not only winding
up his affairs in Dublin, but also bringing to a close his entire
contribution to philosophy. He told Drury of a letter he had received
from Ludwig Hänsel in which Hänsel had expressed the hope that
Wittgenstein’s work would go well, if it should be God’s will. ‘Now that
is all I want’, he said, ‘if it should be God’s will’:74</p>
<p>Bach wrote on the title page of his Orgelbüchlein, ‘To the glory of
the most high God, and that my neighbour may be benefited thereby.’ That
is what I would have liked to say about my work.</p>
<p>The use of the past tense here is telling; it indicates that he now
considered his work to be all but over.</p>
<p>He spent the month before his journey to the United States staying
alternately with von Wright in Cambridge and with Ben Richards in
Uxbridge. Von Wright had just finished his first year as Wittgenstein’s
successor as Professor of Philosophy of Cambridge, and was living in a
rented house (‘Strathaird’) in Lady Margaret Road. During his stay there
Wittgenstein occupied a separate apartment of two rooms and had his
meals with the family (von Wright, his wife and their two children).
‘There is one thing that I’m afraid of’, he wrote to von Wright before
he came to stay with him: ‘I may not be able to discuss philosophy.75 Of
course it’s possible that things will have changed by then, but at
present I’m quite incapable of even thinking of philosophical problems.
My head is completely dull.’</p>
<p>His chief concern during these few weeks in Cambridge was to dictate
to a typist the manuscript containing his final selection of the remarks
written over the last three years, which now forms Part II of
Philosophical Investigations. This is the last typescript that
Wittgenstein is known to have prepared, and as such it represents the
culmination of his attempts to arrange his remarks on psychological
concepts into a publishable form.</p>
<p>It does not represent, however, the completion of that task: as he
had told Elizabeth Anscombe in Dublin, he regarded this new selection as
material to use in the revision of Philosophical Investigations, Part I.
As he never carried out this work of revision himself, the book as we
now have it has the rather unsatisfying two-part structure whereby the
second ‘part’ is no more than material to be used in the revision of the
first. Moreover, the work that was originally conceived of as the
‘second part’ – Wittgenstein’s analysis of mathematical concepts – does
not appear in the book at all. Wittgenstein’s painstaking fastidiousness
over the structure of his book has had the ironic result that his work
has been published in a form very far removed from his original
conception.</p>
<p>The longest section of this new typescript is that concerned with the
problems of aspect-seeing, and is a distillation of the work, already
discussed, that he had written on that topic over the previous three
years. This section constitutes roughly half (thirty-six pages in the
printed version) of the entire typescript. He told Rhees, however, that
the section he was particularly satisfied with was that concerned with
‘Moore’s Paradox’ (Section X). He was pleased, he said, to have
condensed his many remarks on this paradox into such a relatively short
section (three printed pages).</p>
<p>‘Moore’s Paradox’ is the name Wittgenstein gave to the absurdity of
stating a proposition and then saying that one does not believe it – for
example: ‘There is a fire in this room and I don’t believe there is.’
The title ‘Moore’s Paradox’ is perhaps a misnomer: Wittgenstein
believed, probably erroneously, that Moore had discovered this type of
absurdity. (Indeed, he once remarked to Malcolm that its discovery was
the only work of Moore’s that had greatly impressed him.) The interest
Wittgenstein took in the Paradox arises from the fact that, although
anybody who uttered such a statement would ordinarily be taken to be
contradicting themselves, it is not formally a contradiction. That is,
the two statements: ‘There is a fire in this room’ and: ‘RM does not
believe there is a fire in this room’ do not contradict one another.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein first came across the Paradox in a paper by Moore given
to the Moral Science Club in October 1944. He immediately wrote to Moore
urging him to publish his ‘discovery’ and explaining why he considered
it so important:</p>
<p>You have said something about the logic of assertion.76 Viz: It makes
sense to say ‘Let’s suppose: p is the case and I don’t believe that p is
the case’, whereas it makes no sense to assert ‘I-p is the case and I
don’t believe that p is the case.’ This assertion has to be ruled out
and is ruled out by ‘common sense’, just as a contradiction is. And this
just shows that logic isn’t as simple as logicians think it is. In
particular: that contradiction isn’t the unique thing people think it
is. It isn’t the only logically inadmissible form and it is, under
certain circumstances, admissible. And to show that seems to me the
chief merit of your paper.</p>
<p>This was not how Moore himself saw it. He was inclined to say that,
as the Paradox did not issue in formal contradiction, it was an
absurdity for psychological, rather than logical, reasons. This
Wittgenstein vigorously rejected:</p>
<p>If I ask someone ‘Is there a fire in the next room?’ and he answers
‘I believe there is’ I can’t say: ‘Don’t be irrelevant. I asked you
about the fire not about your state of mind!’</p>
<p>Any investigation into what it does and does not make sense to assert
was, for Wittgenstein, a part of logic, and to point out that, in this
sense: ‘logic isn’t as simple as logicians think it is’ was one of the
chief concerns of his own investigations. It was an aspect of
Wittgenstein’s later work that was noted early by Bertrand Russell, who
in his report to the Council of Trinity College of 1930 remarked that
Wittgenstein’s theories were ‘novel, very original, and indubitably
important’. But: ‘Whether they are true, I do not know. As a logician,
who likes simplicity, I should wish to think that they are not.’</p>
<p>‘Moore’s Paradox’ interested Wittgenstein as an illustration that,
contrary to the logician’s desire for simplicity, the forms of our
language cannot be squeezed without distortion into the pigeon-holes
created for them by the categories of formal logic. The statement: ‘I
believe there is a fire in the next room’ is used to assert, albeit
hesitantly, that there is a fire in the next room; it is not used to
assert a state of mind. (‘Don’t regard a hesitant assertion as an
assertion of hesitancy.’77) This distinguishes it from the statements:
‘I believed then that there was a fire in the next room’; and: ‘He
believes there is a fire in the next room’ – both of which would
ordinarily be taken to be about people’s beliefs, rather than about
fires. This feature of the logic of our language forbids us from
constructing the convenient form: ‘x believes/believed p’ and thinking
that the form remains unchanged whatever values are given to x and p: ‘I
believe there is a fire in the next room’ is not the same kind of
assertion as ‘I believed there was a fire in the next room’:</p>
<p>‘But surely “I believed” must tell of just the same thing in the past
as “I believe” in the present!’ – Surely must mean just the same in
relation to –1, as means in relation to 1! This means nothing at
all.78</p>
<p>If we regard the form as having a single meaning, whatever the value
of x, we get into a hopeless tangle when we consider . For, given our
ordinary rules of multiplication, the square root of minus one can be
neither a positive nor a negative number, and within the realm of ‘real
numbers’ there is nothing left for it to be. And yet has a use: it is an
essential notion in many important branches of pure and applied
mathematics. But to give it a meaning it has been found necessary to
construct different meanings of ‘multiplication’, ‘square root’ and even
‘number’ such that the square root of minus one is said to be, not a
real number, but i, an ‘imaginary number’ (or, as it is sometimes
called, an ‘operator’). Given this revised framework, i2 = –1, and the
notion of the square root of minus one is not only unproblematic but is
made the basis of a whole Theory of ‘Complex Numbers’. Wittgenstein was
interested in the square root of minus one for exactly the same reason
that he was interested in ‘Moore’s Paradox’: it illustrates the fact
that superficial similarities of form can disguise very important
differences of meaning.</p>
<p>This latter idea is one of the main themes of the book, justifying
Wittgenstein’s suggestion to Drury that he might use the Earl of Kent’s
phrase: ‘I’ll teach you differences’ as a motto, and it is particularly
evident in the analysis of psychological concepts in Philosophical
Investigations, Part II. Just as he wished to show that logic isn’t as
simple as logicians think it is, so he wished to show that psychological
concepts and the sentences in which they are used, are not as uniform as
philosophers and psychologists would wish them to be. In both cases the
aim is to disencourage the ‘craving for generality’ – to encourage
people to look before they think.</p>
<p>For example, the question: ‘What does the sentence “I am afraid”
mean?’ does not have a single answer that would be adequate to cover all
the occasions on which the sentence might be used. For, as in the case
of the square roots of one and minus one, the differences between the
various uses might be just as important as the similarities:</p>
<p>We can imagine all sorts of things here, for example:79</p>
<p>‘No, no! I am afraid!’</p>
<p>‘I am afraid. I am sorry to have to confess it.’</p>
<p>‘I am still a bit afraid, but no longer as much as before.’</p>
<p>‘At bottom I am afraid, though I won’t confess it to myself.’</p>
<p>‘I torment myself with all sorts of fears.’</p>
<p>‘Now, just when I should be fearless, I am afraid!’</p>
<p>To each of these sentences a special tone of voice is appropriate,
and a different context. It would be possible to imagine people who as
it were thought more definitely than we, and used different words where
we use only one.</p>
<p>To understand what ‘I am afraid’ means on a particular occasion one
might have to take into account the tone of voice and the context in
which it is uttered. There is no reason to think that a general theory
of fear would be much help here (still less a general theory of
language). Far more to the point would be an alert and observant
sensitivity to people’s faces, voices and situations. This kind of
sensitivity can be gained only by experience – by attentive looking and
listening to the people around us. Once, when Wittgenstein and Drury
were walking together in the west of Ireland, they came across a
five-year-old girl sitting outside a cottage. ‘Drury, just look at the
expression on that child’s face’, Wittgenstein implored, adding: ‘You
don’t take enough notice of people’s faces; it is a fault you ought to
try to correct.’80 It is a piece of advice that is implicitly embodied
in his philosophy of psychology: ‘An inner process stands in need of
outward criteria.’ But those outward criteria stand in need of careful
attention.</p>
<p>What is ‘internal’ is not hidden from us. To observe someone’s
outward behaviour – if we understand them – is to observe their state of
mind. The understanding required can be more or less refined. At a basic
level: ’If I see someone writhing in pain with evident cause I do not
think: all the same, his feelings are hidden from me.’81 But at a deeper
level some people, and even whole cultures, will always be an enigma to
us:</p>
<p>It is important for our view of things that someone may feel
concerning certain people that their inner life will always be a mystery
to him.82 That he will never understand them. (Englishwomen in the eyes
of Europeans.)</p>
<p>This is because the commonality of experience required to interpret
the ‘imponderable evidence’, the ‘subtleties of glance, gesture and
tone’, will be missing. This idea is summed up in one of Wittgenstein’s
most striking aphorisms: ’If a lion could talk, we could not understand
him.’83</p>
<p>The abstractions and generalities, the laws and principles, that
result from theorizing can, on Wittgenstein’s view, only hinder our
attempts towards a better understanding of this ‘imponderable evidence’.
But how, in the absence of theory, are we to better our understanding,
to deepen our insight?</p>
<p>Take, for example, one of the hardest and one of the most important
distinctions to make concerning our understanding of people: the
distinction between a genuine and an affected expression of feeling:</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as ‘expert judgment’ about the genuineness of
expressions of feeling? – Even here there are those whose judgment is
‘better’ and those whose judgment is ‘worse’.84</p>
<p>Correcter prognoses will generally issue from the judgments of those
with better knowledge of mankind.</p>
<p>Can one learn this knowledge? Yes; some can. Not, however, by taking
a course in it, but through ‘experience’ . – Can someone else be a man’s
teacher in this? Certainly. From time to time he gives him the right
tip. – This is what ‘learning’ and ‘teaching’ are like here. – What one
acquires here is not a technique; one learns correct judgments. There
are also rules, but they do not form a system, and only experienced
people can apply them right. Unlike calculating rules.</p>
<p>An example of such a teacher might be the figure of Father Zossima in
Dostoevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov:</p>
<p>It was said by many people about the elder Zossima that, by
permitting everyone for so many years to come to bare their hearts and
beg his advice and healing words, he had absorbed so many secrets,
sorrows, and avowals into85 his soul that in the end he had acquired so
fine a perception that he could tell at the first glance from the face
of a stranger what he had come for, what he wanted and what kind of
torment racked his conscience.</p>
<p>In describing Father Zossima, Dostoevsky is here describing
Wittgenstein’s ideal of psychological insight. When, after being
persuaded by Wittgenstein to read The Brothers Karamazov, Drury reported
that he had found the figure of Zossima very impressive, Wittgenstein
replied: ’Yes, there really have been people like that, who could see
directly into the souls of other people and advise them.’86</p>
<p>Such people, Wittgenstein suggests, have more to teach us about
understanding ourselves and other people than the experimental methods
of the modern-day ‘science’ of psychology. This is not because the
science is undeveloped but because the methods it employs are
inappropriate to its task:</p>
<p>The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be explained by
calling it a ‘young science’; its state is not comparable with that of
physics, for instance, in its beginnings.87 (Rather with that of certain
branches of mathematics. Set Theory.) For in psychology there are
experimental methods and conceptual confusion. (As in the other case
conceptual confusion and methods of proof.) The existence of the
experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the
problems which trouble us; though problem and method pass one another
by.</p>
<p>Philosophical Investigations, Part II, ends with a suggestion of what
the second volume of Wittgenstein’s book might have contained:</p>
<p>An investigation is possible in connexion with mathematics which is
entirely analogous to our investigation of psychology. It is just as
little a mathematical investigation as the other is a psychological one.
It will not contain calculations, so it is not for example logistic. It
might deserve the name of an investigation of the ‘foundations of
mathematics’.</p>
<p>By 12 July the work of dictating this typescript was finished, and
Wittgenstein left Cambridge to spend the week remaining before his trip
to the United States with Ben Richards in Uxbridge. During the remaining
two years of his life, although he continued to write philosophy, he
made no further attempt to restructure his book in the way that he had
intended. Philosophical Investigations has therefore reached us in the
somewhat transitory state in which it was left in the summer of
1949.</p>
