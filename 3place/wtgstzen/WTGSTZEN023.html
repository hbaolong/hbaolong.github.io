<h4 id="the-reluctant-professor">20 THE RELUCTANT PROFESSOR</h4>
<p>WHETHER WITTGENSTEIN WOULD ever have returned to Cambridge had it not
been for the Anschluss, one cannot say. His attempts to find a niche in
life outside academia had, however, been at best inconclusive. Though he
sometimes talked of finding a job among ‘ordinary’ people, as he had
encouraged Skinner and Hutt to do, he seems to have made little effort
to do so. His plans to work in Russia and/or to train as a doctor,
though pursued with greater purpose, never crystallized into a firm and
unequivocable intention. He would, perhaps, have continued to try and
find the peace of mind and concentration he required to finish his book,
perhaps in Dublin with Drury or in Norway by himself. But his savings,
of £300 or £400, would not have lasted a lifetime. Eventually, he would
have had to have found some paid employment. That is, as he had put it
to Moore in 1930, he would have had to have found someone who had a use
for the sort of goods he produced. And the place where these goods were
in most demand was, inevitably, in academic life, and particularly in
Cambridge. It is, therefore, perfectly possible that at some time or
other he would have applied for a lectureship. What one can say with
certainty, however, is that if it had not been for the Anschluss, this
would not have been as early as April 1938.</p>
<p>This is not only because Wittgenstein was then not eager to return to
teaching, but also because he was apprehensive about his relationship
with Francis. As indicated by his diary entries in the New Year, he was
deeply concerned about the sensuality that existed between himself and
Francis, and anxious whether, on his part at least, such sensual desires
were compatible with true love. He would have preferred to have loved
Francis at a distance, away from the temptation of his sensual
‘susceptibility’. And yet, his fear of losing Francis altogether had now
brought him back to Cambridge, and more firmly than ever into the sphere
of that temptation.</p>
<p>Upon his return he moved into Francis’s lodgings above the grocer’s
shop on East Road, and for over a year they lived, as Francis had always
wished them to live, as a couple. Their period as collaborators on
Wittgenstein’s work had long come to an end. While Wittgenstein lectured
and continued to work on his book, Francis worked at the factory. There
are no letters from Francis during this period, and no relevant remarks
among Wittgenstein’s coded diary-notes, so we do not know how or why
their relationship deteriorated during this year. All we know is that by
1939 it had deteriorated, and that for the following two years it was
only Francis’s undyingly faithful, perhaps even clinging, love for
Wittgenstein that kept it going. Wittgenstein’s love for Francis, it
seems, did not – perhaps could not – survive the physical closeness that
he at once craved and feared.</p>
<p>Among his students at this time, Wittgenstein found a new generation
of disciples. In order to keep his class down to a size with which he
felt comfortable, he did not announce his lectures in the usual way in
the Cambridge University Recorder. Instead, John Wisdom, Moore and
Braithwaite were asked to tell those students they thought would be
interested about the classes. No more than about ten students attended.
Among this select band were Rush Rhees, Yorick Smythies, James Taylor,
Casimir Lewy and Theodore Redpath. The class was small enough for them
all to get to know Wittgenstein fairly well, although it was Rhees,
Taylor and Smythies that became particularly close friends during this
period.</p>
<p>The classes were held in Taylor’s rooms. Taylor, about whom almost
nothing is mentioned in the published memoirs, was a Canadian, a
graduate of Toronto University, who had come to Cambridge to study under
G. E. Moore and, through Moore, became a friend of Wittgenstein’s. After
the war he was offered a lectureship in philosophy at an Australian
university, but died in a pub brawl in Brisbane while on his way to take
up the post. Smythies is one of those mysterious figures who are
referred to repeatedly in the published texts, but about whom little is
ever said. He was a devoted disciple of Wittgenstein’s and a truly
Wittgensteinian character in the sense that, though he never became a
professional philosopher, he never ceased to think seriously and deeply
about philosophical problems. He remained a close friend of
Wittgenstein’s for the rest of Wittgenstein’s life. When he left
Cambridge he became a librarian at Oxford. In later life he suffered
from paranoid schizophrenia and became a patient of Maurice Drury. He
died in tragic circumstances in 1981. Regarding such people, one is
reminded of the fact that those whom Wittgenstein influenced most
strongly, particularly in the 1930s (one thinks of Drury, Skinner and
Hutt, as well as Smythies), did not enter academic life. There is
therefore a large and important aspect of Wittgenstein’s influence that
is not, and cannot be, reflected in the large body of academic
literature that Wittgenstein’s work has inspired. The only one of these
to have published anything is Maurice Drury, whose collection of essays
on philosophical and psychological issues, The Danger of Words, though
it has been almost completely ignored in the secondary literature, is,
in its attitudes and concerns, more truly Wittgensteinian than almost
any other secondary text.</p>
<p>On vacation from his final year’s training as a doctor, Drury managed
to attend one of the lectures in Wittgenstein’s new course. During this
lecture Wittgenstein told one of the students to stop making notes:</p>
<p>If you write these spontaneous remarks down, some day someone may
publish them as my considered opinions.1 I don’t want that done. For I
am talking now freely as my ideas come, but all this will need a lot
more thought and better expression.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this request was ignored, and notes from these lectures
have indeed been published.fn1</p>
<p>These lectures are unique among Wittgenstein’s corpus. Their
subject-matter alone would make them so, for they are concerned, not
with mathematics or philosophy generally, but with aesthetics and
religious belief. This difference is less radical than it might appear,
for Wittgenstein brings to his discussion of these subjects many of the
same examples that he used in other contexts – Cantor’s Diagonal Proof,
Freud’s confusion between cause and reason and so on – so that his
discussion of aesthetics, for example, looks not so very different from
his discussions of the philosophy of mathematics or the philosophy of
psychology. What distinguishes these lectures is their tone. Precisely
because he was speaking in a spontaneous and unguarded manner, they
provide one of the most unambiguous statements of his purpose in
philosophy, and of how this purpose connects with his personal
Weltanschauung. Through them, it is made even clearer that his target
was not merely, as he had put it in the Blue Book, the damage that is
done when philosophers ‘see the method of science before their eyes and
are irresistibly tempted to ask and answer questions in the way that
science does’; it was, more generally, the wretched effect that the
worship of science and the scientific method has had upon our whole
culture. Aesthetics and religious belief are two examples – for
Wittgenstein, of course, crucially important examples – of areas of
thought and life in which the scientific method is not appropriate, and
in which efforts to make it so lead to distortion, superficiality and
confusion.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein told his audience that what he was doing was ‘persuading
people to change their style of thinking’.2 He was, he said, ‘making
propaganda’ for one style of thinking as opposed to another. ‘I am
honestly disgusted with the other’, he added. The ‘other’ he identified
as the worship of science, and he therefore spent some time in these
lectures execrating what he considered to be powerful and damaging forms
of evangelism for this worship – the popular scientific works of the
time, such as Jeans’s The Mysterious Universe:</p>
<p>Jeans has written a book called The Mysterious Universe and I loathe
it and call it misleading.3 Take the title … I might say the title The
Mysterious Universe includes a kind of idol worship, the idol being
Science and the Scientist.</p>
<p>In discussing aesthetics, Wittgenstein was not attempting to
contribute to the philosophical discipline that goes by that name. The
very idea that there could be such a discipline was a consequence, or
perhaps a symptom, of the ‘other’. He was, instead, trying to rescue
questions of artistic appreciation from that discipline, particularly
from the idea that there could be a kind of science of aesthetics:</p>
<p>You might think Aesthetics is a science telling us what’s beautiful –
almost too ridiculous for words.4 I suppose it ought to include also
what sort of coffee tastes well.</p>
<p>When Rhees asked Wittgenstein about his ‘theory’ of deterioration
(referring to one of Wittgenstein’s examples, which was the
deterioration of the German musical tradition), Wittgenstein reacted
with horror to the word: ’Do you think I have a theory? Do you think I’m
saying what deterioration is? What I do is describe different things
called deterioration.’5</p>
<p>Rather than trying to answer the traditional questions of aesthetics
(‘What is beauty?’ etc.), Wittgenstein gives a succession of examples to
show that artistic appreciation does not consist (as one might think
from reading some philosophical discussions of aesthetics) in standing
before a painting and saying: ‘That is beautiful.’ Appreciation takes a
bewildering variety of forms, which differ from culture to culture, and
quite often will not consist in saying anything. Appreciation will be
shown, by actions as often as by words, by certain gestures of disgust
or satisfaction, by the way we read a work of poetry or play a piece of
music, by how often we read or listen to the same piece, and how we do
so. These different forms of appreciation do not have any one thing in
common that one can isolate in answer to the question: ‘What is artistic
appreciation?’ They are, rather, linked by a complicated series of
‘family resemblances’. Thus:</p>
<p>It is not only difficult to describe what appreciation consists in,
but impossible.6 To describe what it consists in we would have to
describe the whole environment.</p>
<p>Above all, in seeking to answer the why and how of aesthetic
understanding, we are not looking for a causal explanation. There is no
science of aesthetics, and neither can the results of some other
science, such as physics, or some pseudo-science, such as psychology, be
brought to bear on these questions. Wittgenstein quotes two kinds of
explanation from the work of Freud, which illustrate, respectively, the
kind of reductive account that he thought should be avoided at all
costs, and the other ‘style of thinking’ that he was trying to
promote.</p>
<p>The first comes from The Interpretation of Dreams, and concerns
Freud’s ‘explanation’ of what his patient had described to him as a
pretty dream. In retelling the dream Freud puts certain words in
capitals to indicate – with a nod and a wink, as it were – the sexual
allusions:</p>
<p>She was descending from a height … She was holding a BIG BRANCH in
her hand; actually it was like a tree, covered over with RED BLOSSOMS …
Then she saw, after she had got down, a manservant who was combing a
similar tree, that is to say he was using a PIECE OF WOOD to drag out
some THICK TUFTS OF HAIR that were hanging down from it like moss.7</p>
<p>And so on. Later in the dream the woman comes across people taking
branches and throwing them into the road where they lay (LAY) about. She
asks whether she might also take one – that is, explains Freud, whether
she might pull one down, i.e. masturbate (in German, the phrase ‘to pull
one down’ is equivalent to the English ‘to toss oneself off’). Freud
adds: ‘The dreamer quite lost her liking for this pretty dream after it
had been interpreted.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s response to this is to say that Freud has cheated his
patient: ‘I would say to the patient: “Do these associations make the
dream not beautiful? It was beautiful.8 Why shouldn’t it be?”’ Freud’s
reduction of the pretty elements of the dream to bawdy innuendo has a
certain charm, a certain fascination, but it is wrong to say that Freud
has shown what the dream is really about. Wittgenstein compared it to
the statement: ‘If we boil Redpath at 200 degrees C. all that is left
when the water vapour is gone is some ashes, etc. This is all Redpath
really is.’ Saying this, he says, might have a certain charm, ‘but it
would be misleading to say the least’.</p>
<p>The sort of Freudian explanations that Wittgenstein mentioned with
approval are those contained in Jokes and their Relation to the
Unconscious. Wittgenstein does not give any examples, but perhaps a
simple one will suffice. In the early part of the book, Freud discusses
a joke in Heine’s Reisebilder. One of Heine’s characters, a humble
lottery-agent, in boasting about his relations with Baron Rothschild,
remarks: ‘He treated me quite as his equal – quite familionairely’.9 The
reason this makes us laugh, Freud claims, is not only that it is a
clever abbreviation of the thought that Rothschild treated the man as
his equal, quite familiarly, so far as a millionaire can, but also
because it brings out a suppressed subsidiary thought: that there is
actually something rather unpleasant about being treated with a rich
man’s condescension.</p>
<p>If we are inclined to accept this sort of explanation, Wittgenstein
asks, on what grounds do we do so?</p>
<p>‘If it is not causal how do you know it’s correct?’ You say: ’Yes,
that’s right.’10 Freud transforms the joke into a different form which
is recognised by us as an expression of the chain of ideas which led us
from one end to another of a joke. An entirely new account of a correct
explanation. Not one agreeing with experience but one accepted.</p>
<p>It was essential to this form of explanation, he stressed, that: ‘You
have to give the explanation that is accepted. This is the whole point
of the explanation.’ And this is precisely the sort of explanation one
wants in aesthetics: not one that establishes a cause for something’s
being beautiful, or for our regarding something as beautiful, but rather
one that, by showing connections we had not thought of previously, shows
what is beautiful about it – shows why, for example, a certain piece of
music or a certain play, poem etc. is correctly regarded as a great
work.</p>
<p>In his lectures Wittgenstein gave some examples from his own
experience of what happens when one begins to understand the greatness
of an artistic work. He had, he said, read the work of Friedrich
Klopstock, the eighteenth-century poet, and initially failed to see
anything in it. Then he realized that the way to read him was to stress
his metre abnormally:</p>
<p>When I read his poems in this new way, I said: ‘Ah-ha, now I know why
he did this.’11 What had happened? I had read this kind of stuff and had
been moderately bored, but when I read it in this particular way,
intensely, I smiled, said: ‘This is grand, etc. But I might not have
said anything. The important fact was that I read it again and again.
When I read these poems I made gestures and facial expressions which
were what would be called gestures of approval. But the important thing
was that I read the poems entirely differently, more intensely, and said
to others: ‘Look! This is how they should be read.’</p>
<p>Another example he might have given was The King of the Dark Chamber
by the Indian poet, Rabindranath Tagore. Wittgenstein had first read
this play, in a German translation (it was originally written in
Bengali), in 1921, when Tagore was at the height of his fame and
enormously popular in Europe, particularly in Germany and Austria. He
had then written to Engelmann that, despite its great wisdom, the play
had failed to make a deep impression on him. He was not moved:</p>
<p>It seems to me as if all that wisdom has come out of the ice box; I
should not be surprised to learn that he got it all second-hand by
reading and listening (exactly as so many among us acquire their
knowledge of Christian wisdom) rather than from his own genuine
feeling.12 Perhaps I don’t understand his tone; to me it does not ring
like the tone of a man possessed by the truth. (Like for instance
Ibsen’s tone.) It is possible, however, that here the translation leaves
a chasm which I cannot bridge. I read with interest throughout, but
without being gripped. That does not seem to be a good sign. For this is
a subject that could have gripped me – or have I become so deadened that
nothing will touch me any longer? A possibility, no doubt.</p>
<p>– Again, I do not feel for a single moment that here is a drama
taking place. I merely understand the allegory in an abstract way.</p>
<p>Just a few months after this, he wrote to Hänsel saying that he had
been rereading Tagore, ‘and this time with much more pleasure’. ‘I now
believe’, he told Hänsel, ’that there is indeed something grand here.’13
The King of the Dark Chamber subsequently became one of his favourite
books, one of those he habitually gave or lent to his friends.14 And at
about the time of his lectures on aesthetics he reread the play together
with Yorick Smythies, this time in an English translation made by Tagore
himself. Again, it seems, the translation left a chasm, and in order to
overcome this – in order to, as it were, defrost the text – Smythies and
Wittgenstein prepared their own translation. Among Smythies’s papers was
found a typed copy of their version of Act II of the play, headed:</p>
<p>THE KING OF THE DARK CHAMBER, by Rabindranath Tagor [sic] translated
from the English of Rabindranath Tagor into English used by L.
Wittgenstein and Yorick Smythies, by L. Wittgenstein and Yorick
Smythies.</p>
<p>Almost all the changes introduced by Smythies and Wittgenstein
involve substituting modern, idiomatic words and phrases for Tagore’s
old-fashioned ‘poetic’ diction. Thus, where Tagore has ‘chamber’, they
have ‘room’ (except in the title), and where Tagore wrote: ‘He has no
dearth of rooms’, they write: ‘He’s not short of rooms’, and so on.</p>
<p>The play is an allegory of religious awakening, and it echoes many of
Wittgenstein’s own thoughts on the subject. The King of the title is
never seen by his subjects, some of whom doubt his existence, while
others believe that he is so ugly he dare not reveal himself. Others,
such as the maidservant Surangama, are so devoted to the King and so
worshipful that they do not ask to see him; they know him to be a being
without comparison to other mortals. Only these people, who have
completely overcome their own pride in subjection to their master, have
a sense of when the King is approaching and when he is present. The play
concerns the awakening – or, one might say, the humbling, the
subjugation – of the King’s wife, Sudarshana. She is shown first as a
proud Queen, bemoaning the cruelty of her husband, whom she can meet
only in a room that is kept forever dark. She longs to see him, to know
whether he is handsome, and out of that longing falls in love with
another king, whom she meets in the world outside and mistakes for her
husband. Only when she has been brought by this mistake to complete
despair, when she feels utterly humiliated and degraded and has cast
away her pride, can she be reconciled with her real husband, before whom
she now bows with total servility. Only, that is, when Queen Sudarshana
is brought down to the level of the servant Surangama can she become
enlightened. The play ends with her realization that everything of any
real value is conferred upon her by the King, who can now say to her:
‘Come, come with me now, come outside – into the light!’</p>
<p>The part of the play translated by Wittgenstein and Smythies is a
conversation between Surangama and Sudarshana in which the servant tries
to explain to the Queen how she became so completely devoted to the
King, though she has never seen him, and though he caused her to suffer
greatly when he banished her father from the kingdom. When the King
exiled her father, the Queen asks, didn’t Surangama feel bitterly
oppressed? ‘It made me furious’, the servant replies:</p>
<p>I was on the road to ruin and destruction: when that road was closed
to me, I seemed left without any support, without help or shelter. I
raved and raged like a wild animal in a cage – I wanted, in my powerless
anger, to tear everyone to pieces.</p>
<p>‘But how did you become devoted to the King who had done all this?’
Sudarshana asks. When did this change of feeling take place? ‘I couldn’t
tell you’, comes the reply:</p>
<p>I don’t know myself. A day came when all the rebel in me knew itself
beaten, and then my whole nature bowed down in humble resignation in the
dust. And then I saw … I saw that he was as incomparable in beauty as he
was in terror. I was saved, I was rescued.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s translation of Tagore might fruitfully be read in
conjunction with his lectures on religious belief, for in those passages
he translated, Tagore expresses Wittgenstein’s own religious ideal. That
is, like Surangama, Wittgenstein did not wish to see God or to find
reasons for His existence. He thought that if he could overcome himself
– if a day came when his whole nature ‘bowed down in humble resignation
in the dust’ – then God would, as it were, come to him; he would then be
saved.</p>
<p>In his lectures on religious belief he concentrates only on the first
part of this conviction – the denial of the necessity to have reasons
for religious beliefs. In their rejection of the relevance of the
scientific mode of thought, these lectures are of a piece with those on
aesthetics. They might also be seen as an elaboration of his remark to
Drury: ‘Russell and the parsons between them have done infinite harm,
infinite harm.’15 Why pair Russell and the parsons in the one
condemnation? Because both have encouraged the idea that a philosophical
justification for religious beliefs is necessary for those beliefs to be
given any credence. Both the atheist, who scorns religion because he has
found no evidence for its tenets, and the believer, who attempts to
prove the existence of God, have fallen victim to the ‘other’ – to the
idol-worship of the scientific style of thinking. Religious beliefs are
not analogous to scientific theories, and should not be accepted or
rejected using the same evidential criteria.</p>
<p>The kind of experience that can make a man religious, Wittgenstein
insists, is not at all like the experience of drawing a conclusion from
an experiment, or of extrapolating from a collection of data. He takes
as an example someone who dreams of the Last Judgement, and now says he
knows what it will be like:</p>
<p>Suppose someone said: ‘This is poor evidence.’16 I would say: ‘If you
want to compare it with the evidence for it’s raining to-morrow it is no
evidence at all.’ He may make it sound as if by stretching the point you
may call it evidence. But it may be more than ridiculous as evidence.
But now, would I be prepared to say: ‘You are basing your belief on
extremely slender evidence, to put it mildly?’ Why should I regard this
dream as evidence – measuring its validity as though I were measuring
the validity of the evidence for meteorological events?</p>
<p>If you compare it with anything in Science which we call evidence,
you can’t credit that anyone could soberly argue: ‘Well, I had this
dream … therefore … Last Judgement.’ You might say: ‘For a blunder,
that’s too big.’ If you suddenly wrote numbers down on the blackboard,
and then said: ‘Now, I’m going to add’, and then said: ‘2 and 21 is 13’,
etc. I’d say: ‘This is no blunder.’</p>
<p>On the question of how we are to accept or reject religious beliefs,
and of what we are to believe about such things as the existence of God,
the Last Judgement, the immortality of the soul etc., Wittgenstein is,
in these lectures, non-committal:</p>
<p>Suppose someone said: ‘What do you believe, Wittgenstein? Are you a
sceptic? Do you know whether you will survive death?’ I would really,
this is a fact, say ‘I can’t say.17 I don’t know’, because I haven’t any
clear idea what I’m saying when I’m saying ‘I don’t cease to exist’,
etc.</p>
<p>It is clear from remarks he wrote elsewhere, however (for example in
his remarks written on the boat to Bergen and quoted earlier), that he
thought that if he could come to believe in God and the Resurrection –
if he could even come to attach some meaning to the expression of those
beliefs – then it would not be because he had found any evidence, but
rather because he had been redeemed.</p>
<p>Still there is a persistent and nagging doubt about how Wittgenstein
expected, or hoped, this redemption to come about – whether, so to
speak, it was in his hands or God’s.</p>
<p>On this central question The King of the Dark Chamber is, like
Wittgenstein, ambiguous. After Sudarshana has been saved, she remarks to
the King: ‘You are not beautiful, my lord – you stand beyond all
comparisons!’ To which the King replies: ‘That which can be comparable
with me lies within yourself.’18 ‘If this be so’, says Sudarshana, ‘then
that too is beyond comparison’:</p>
<p>Your love lives in me – you are mirrored in that love, and you see
your face reflected in me: nothing of this is mine, it is all yours.</p>
<p>And yet elsewhere in the play, it is the King who holds up the
mirror. Those who think he is ugly, we are told, do so because they
fashion the King after the image of themselves they see reflected there.
And so, one wants to ask, is ‘that which lies beyond all comparisons’
within us or not? What do we need to do in order to see it – polish up
the mirror that is our self so that it can be reflected, or look with
open eyes at the mirror and see it reflected in ourselves? Perhaps here
we run up against the limits of meaningful language, and go beyond the
applicability of the Law of Excluded Middle and the Law of
Contradiction.fn2 ‘It’, perhaps, both is and is not within us, and to
find it we must both search within ourselves and recognize our
dependence on something, some power, outside ourselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps the difference between allowing ‘it’ to be reflected in us
and finding it in the reflection of us is not as great as it seems. In
both cases we must remove the dirt that obscures the reflection. In this
respect Wittgenstein laboured hard, polishing off the slightest speck,
determined not to let himself get away with the smallest misdemeanour.
In October 1938, for example, he wrote to George Thomson’s mother-in-law
earnestly apologizing for a transgression of quite extraordinary
inconsequence:</p>
<p>Dear Mrs Stewart,19</p>
<p>I must apologise for an untruth I told you today in Miss Pate’s
office. I said that I had seen Mrs Thomson recently in Birmingham;
andandandand only when I came home this evening it occurred to me that
this wasn’t true at all. I stayed with the Bachtin’s a few weeks ago in
Birmingham andandandand I tried to see Mrs Thomson andandandand we had a
talk on the phone; but I wasn’t able to see her. When I talked to you
this afternoon what was in my head was that I had seen Mrs Thomson at
your house before she went to Birmingham. Please forgive my
stupidity.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>L. Wittgenstein</p>
<p>In the context of his search for redemption through the dismantling
of his pride, Wittgenstein’s philosophical work occupies a curiously
ambivalent place. On the one hand it is undoubtedly informed by the same
attitudes that directed that search. On the other hand, it was itself
the greatest source of his pride. Though he tried repeatedly to exclude
from his work any question of pride, and to write, as he put it, ‘to the
glory of God’ rather than out of vanity, yet we find again and again
that it was to his philosophical work more than to anything else that he
brought what Russell called his ‘pride of Lucifer’.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1938 he prepared for publication a typescript based
on the work he had written in Norway. This typescript constitutes the
very earliest version of Philosophical Investigations. ‘For more than
one reason’, he wrote in the preface:</p>
<p>what I publish here will have points of contact with what other
people are writing today. – If my remarks do not bear a stamp which
marks them as mine, – I do not wish to lay any further claim to them as
my property.</p>
<p>And yet, that they were his property was enormously important to him,
and that Carnap, Braithwaite, Waismann, Ambrose and others had published
ideas derivative of them was precisely the reason he was now prepared to
go into print. In a later preface he admitted as much:</p>
<p>I was obliged to learn that my results (which I had communicated in
lectures, typescripts and discussions), variously misunderstood, more or
less angled or watered down, were in circulation. This stung my vanity
and I had difficulty in quieting it.</p>
<p>But if pride gave birth to his desire to publish, it also prevented
his doing so. In September the book was offered to Cambridge University
Press, who agreed to publish the German original with a parallel English
translation. About a month later, however, the Press was told that
Wittgenstein was now uncertain about the publication of his book, and
the project had been, for the time being, shelved.</p>
<p>There were two reasons for Wittgenstein’s doubts. One, the most
important, was that he became increasingly dissatisfied with the second
half of the book, which dealt with the philosophy of mathematics. The
other was concerned with the problems in translating his work.</p>
<p>On Moore’s recommendation, Wittgenstein asked Rush Rhees to undertake
the translation. It was a formidable task – not because Wittgenstein’s
German is difficult (in the way that, for example, Kant’s German is
difficult), but rather because Wittgenstein’s language has the
singularly rare quality of being both colloquial and painstakingly
precise.</p>
<p>Rhees laboured on the translation throughout the Michaelmas term of
1938. During this time he met with Wittgenstein regularly to discuss the
problems that arose. In January 1939 he had to leave Cambridge to visit
the United States, and so left a typescript of his work with
Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein, who was never easily pleased with any
attempt by others to represent his thoughts, was horrified at what he
saw.</p>
<p>By this time the question of having a decent English edition of his
work had acquired an importance outside his plans to publish. He had by
then decided to apply for the post of Professor of Philosophy, which had
become vacant on G. E. Moore’s resignation, and he wanted to submit the
translated portion of his book in support of his application. He was, in
any case, convinced that he would not be elected, partly because one of
the other applicants was John Wisdom, whom he felt sure would get it,
and partly because one of the electors was R. G. Collingwood of Oxford,
a man who was sure to disapprove of Wittgenstein’s work. More than
compensating for these two disadvantages, however, was the fact that
also among the electors was John Maynard Keynes. Wittgenstein hurriedly
attempted to improve on Rhees’s translation in time for Keynes to read
through the English version. ‘I needn’t say the whole thing is absurd’,
he wrote to Moore, ’as he couldn’t make head or tail of it if it were
translated very well.’20</p>
<p>Wittgenstein would probably have been awarded the chair with or
without Keynes’s support, and regardless of the quality of the
translation. By 1939 he was recognized as the foremost philosophical
genius of his time. ‘To refuse the chair to Wittgenstein’, said C. D.
Broad, ’would be like refusing Einstein a chair of physics.’21 Broad
himself was no great admirer of Wittgenstein’s work; he was simply
stating a fact.</p>
<p>On 11 February Wittgenstein was duly elected professor. It was,
inevitably, an occasion for both expressing pride and condemning it.
‘Having got the professorship is very flattering andandandand all that’,
he wrote to Eccles, ‘but it might have been very much better for me to
have got a job opening and closing crossing gates.22 I don’t get any
kick out of my position (except what my vanity andandandand stupidity
sometimes gets).’ This in turn helped with his application for British
citizenship, and on 2 June 1939 he received his British passport. No
matter how illiberal their policy on the admission of Austrian Jews, the
British government could hardly refuse citizenship to the Professor of
Philosophy at the University of Cambridge.</p>
<p>More serious than the problems with translation, as far as the
publication of Wittgenstein’s remarks was concerned, was his
dissatisfaction with what he had written on the philosophy of
mathematics. In the three terms of 1939 he devoted a series of lectures
to the subject. They are, to a certain extent, similar in theme to the
previous year’s lectures on aesthetics and religious belief, only now it
is Russell and the logicians who between them have done infinite harm,
and mathematics that has to be rescued, from the clutches of
philosophical theorists. The strategy of these lectures was, indeed,
announced in the earlier lectures on aesthetics, when, in discussing
Cantor’s Diagonal Proof, he expressed his loathing of it and his view
that it was only the ‘charm’ of such proofs (he presumably meant by this
the fascination it exerts to be told that it is provable that there
exists an infinite number of different infinite cardinalities) that gave
them their interest. ‘I would’, he said, ‘do my utmost to show the
effects of this charm, and of the associations of “Mathematics”’:23</p>
<p>Being Mathematics … it looks incontrovertible and this gives it a
still greater charm. If we explain the surrounding of the expression we
see that the thing could have been expressed in an entirely different
way. I can put it in a way in which it will lose its charm for a great
number of people and certainly will lose its charm for me.</p>
<p>The aim, then, was to reinterpret mathematics – to redescribe it in
such a way that the mathematical realm that appeared to have been opened
up by Cantor’s Proof was presented, not as a fascinating world awaiting
the discovery of mathematicians, but as a swamp, a quagmire of
philosophical confusions. The mathematician Hilbert had once said: ‘No
one is going to turn us out of the paradise which Cantor has created.’
‘I would say’, Wittgenstein told his class: ‘I wouldn’t dream of trying
to drive anyone out of this paradise’:24</p>
<p>I would do something quite different: I would try to show you that it
is not a paradise – so that you’ll leave of your own accord. I would
say, ‘You’re welcome to this; just look about you.’</p>
<p>The lectures on mathematics form part of Wittgenstein’s general
attack on the idol-worship of science. Indeed, he perceived this
particular campaign as the most important part of that struggle. ‘There
is no religious denomination’, he once wrote, ‘in which the misuse of
metaphysical expressions has been responsible for so much sin as it has
in mathematics.’25 The ‘charm’ exerted by the metaphysics of mathematics
was even more potent than that exerted by such books as Jeans’s The
Mysterious Universe, and an even more powerful influence in the
idolization of science, which was, Wittgenstein thought, the most
significant symptom, and perhaps even a contributory cause, of the decay
of our culture.</p>
<p>It was thus his task to destroy that metaphysics. A feature of these
lectures is that, in attempting to accomplish that task, he does not, as
he had earlier, discuss mathematics itself with any degree of technical
sophistication. He does not, for example, as he had in 1932–3, read out
extracts from Hardy’s textbook A Course of Pure Mathematics; nor does
he, as he had in Philosophical Grammar, subject particular proofs (such
as Skolem’s Proof of the Associative Law) to rigorous and detailed
analysis. Technical details are eschewed altogether. When he discusses
Russell’s Paradox, for instance, he does so in a way that is, from a
mathematical point of view, quite extraordinarily primitive:</p>
<p>Take Russell’s contradiction.26 There are concepts which we call
predicates – ‘man’, ‘chair’, and ‘wolf’ are predicates, but ‘Jack’ and
‘John’ are not. Some predicates apply to themselves and others don’t.
For instance ‘chair’ is not a chair, ‘wolf’ is not a wolf, but
‘predicate’ is a predicate. You might say this is bosh. And in a sense
it is.</p>
<p>This lack of sophistication has, I think, a propagandist purpose.
Wittgenstein’s use of casual, everyday, language in discussion of
problems in mathematical logic, and his simple dismissal as ‘bosh’ of
the terms in which those problems have been raised, serves as an
antidote to the seriousness and earnestness with which they have been
discussed by those who have fallen for their ‘charm’ (including, for
example, himself, in 1911). But also, for the problems he wished to
raise, technical details were irrelevant. ‘All the puzzles I will
discuss’, he said in his first lecture, ’can be exemplified by the most
elementary mathematics – in calculations which we learn from ages six to
fifteen, or in what we easily might have learned, for example, Cantor’s
proof.’27</p>
<p>This series of lectures was remarkable in having among its audience a
man who was one of the ablest exponents of the view that Wittgenstein
was attacking, and also one of the greatest mathematicians of the
century: Alan Turing. During the Easter term of 1939, Turing too gave
classes under the title, ‘Foundations of Mathematics’. They could not
have been more different from Wittgenstein’s. Turing’s course was an
introduction to the discipline of mathematical logic, in which he took
his students through the technique of proving mathematical theorems from
within a strictly axiomatic system of logic. Lest it be thought that his
lectures had anything to do with the ‘foundations of mathematics’ in
this sense, Wittgenstein announced:</p>
<p>Another idea might be that I was going to lecture on a particular
branch of mathematics called ‘the foundations of mathematics’.28 There
is such a branch, dealt with in Principia Mathematica, etc. I am not
going to lecture on this. I know nothing about it – I practically only
know the first volume of Principia Mathematica.</p>
<p>That it was at one time thought (by both himself and Russell) that he
would be responsible for rewriting sections of the Principia, he does
not mention. His present series of lectures was relevant to that branch
of mathematics only in the sense of trying to undermine the rationale
for its existence – of trying to show that: ’The mathematical problems
of what is called foundations are no more the foundations of mathematics
for us than the painted rock is the support of the painted tower.’29</p>
<p>The lectures often developed into a dialogue between Wittgenstein and
Turing, with the former attacking and the latter defending the
importance of mathematical logic. Indeed, the presence of Turing became
so essential to the theme of the discussion that when he announced he
would not be attending a certain lecture, Wittgenstein told the class
that, therefore, that lecture would have to be ‘somewhat
parenthetical’.30</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s technique was not to reinterpret certain particular
proofs, but, rather, to redescribe the whole of mathematics in such a
way that mathematical logic would appear as the philosophical aberration
he believed it to be, and in a way that dissolved entirely the picture
of mathematics as a science which discovers facts about mathematical
objects (numbers, sets etc.). ‘I shall try again and again’, he said,
‘to show that what is called a mathematical discovery had much better be
called a mathematical invention.’31 There was, on his view, nothing for
the mathematician to discover. A proof in mathematics does not establish
the truth of a conclusion; it fixes, rather, the meaning of certain
signs. The ‘inexorability’ of mathematics, therefore, does not consist
in certain knowledge of mathematical truths, but in the fact that
mathematical propositions are grammatical. To deny, for example, that
two plus two equals four is not to disagree with a widely held view
about a matter of fact; it is to show ignorance of the meanings of the
terms involved. Wittgenstein presumably thought that if he could
persuade Turing to see mathematics in this light, he could persuade
anybody.</p>
<p>But Turing was not to be persuaded. For him, as for Russell and for
most professional mathematicians, the beauty of mathematics, its very
‘charm’, lay precisely in its power to provide, in an otherwise
uncertain world, unassailable truths. (‘Irrefragability, thy name is
mathematics!’ as W. V. Quine once put it.) Asked at one point whether he
understood what Wittgenstein was saying, Turing replied: ’I understand
but I don’t agree that it is simply a question of giving new meanings to
words.’32 To this, Wittgenstein – somewhat bizarrely – commented:</p>
<p>Turing doesn’t object to anything I say. He agrees with every word.
He objects to the idea he thinks underlies it. He thinks we’re
undermining mathematics, introducing Bolshevism into mathematics. But
not at all.</p>
<p>It was important to Wittgenstein’s conception of his philosophical
method that there could be no disagreements of opinion between himself
and Turing. In his philosophy he was not advancing any theses, so how
could there possibly be anything to disagree with? When Turing once used
the phrase: ‘I see your point’, Wittgenstein reacted forcefully: ‘I have
no point.’33 If Turing was inclined to object to what Wittgenstein was
saying, it could only be because he was using words in a different way
to Wittgenstein – it could only be a question of giving meanings to
words. Or, rather, it could only be a question of Turing’s not
understanding Wittgenstein’s use of certain words. For example, Turing
was inclined to say that there could be experiments in mathematics –
that is, that we could pursue a mathematical investigation in the same
spirit in which we might conduct an experiment in physics: ‘We don’t
know how this might turn out, but let’s see …’ To Wittgenstein, this was
quite impossible; the whole analogy between mathematics and physics was
completely mistaken, and one of the most important sources of the
confusions he was trying to unravel. But how was he to make this clear
without opposing Turing’s view with a view of his own? He had to: (a)
get Turing to admit that they were both using the word ‘experiment’ in
the same sense; and (b) get him to see that, in that sense,
mathematicians do not make experiments.</p>
<p>Turing thinks that he and I are using the word ‘experiment’ in two
different ways.34 But I want to show that this is wrong. That is to say,
I think that if I could make myself clear, then Turing would give up
saying that in mathematics we make experiments. If I could arrange in
their proper order certain well-known facts, then it would become clear
that Turing and I are not using the word ‘experiment’ differently.</p>
<p>You might say: ‘How is it possible that there should be a
misunderstanding so very hard to remove?’</p>
<p>It can be explained partly by a difference of education.</p>
<p>It might also be explained by the fact that Turing refused to leave
his mathematician’s paradise, or that he suspected Wittgenstein of
Bolshevism. What could not account for it, on Wittgenstein’s view, was
that there was here a substantive difference of opinion. ‘Obviously’, he
told his class, ’the whole point is that I must not have an
opinion.’35</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, however, quite clearly did have very strong opinions –
opinions that were, moreover, at variance with the conception of their
subject held by most professional mathematicians. His suggestion that
Turing suspected him of ‘introducing Bolshevism into mathematics’ is an
allusion to Frank Ramsey’s 1925 essay ‘The Foundations of Mathematics’,
in which he had talked of rescuing mathematics from the ‘Bolshevik
menace’ of Brouwer and Weyl, who, in their rejection of the Law of
Excluded Middle, had regarded as illegitimate certain standard proofs in
conventional analysis.36 To Turing, however, it must have seemed that
Wittgenstein’s Bolshevism was of a far more extreme sort. It was not,
after all, the Law of Excluded Middle that Wittgenstein challenged, but
the Principle of Contradiction.</p>
<p>All the conventional schools of thought on the foundations of
mathematics – logicism, formalism and intuitionism – agree that if a
system has a hidden contradiction in it, then it is to be rejected on
the grounds of being inconsistent. Indeed, the whole point of providing
mathematics with sound logical foundations was that Calculus, as
traditionally understood, is manifestly inconsistent.</p>
<p>In his lectures, Wittgenstein ridiculed this concern for ‘hidden
contradictions’, and it was to this that Turing voiced his most dogged
and spirited dissent. Take the case of the Liar Paradox, Wittgenstein
suggested:</p>
<p>It is very queer in a way that this should have puzzled anyone – much
more extraordinary than you might think: that this should be the thing
to worry human beings.37 Because the thing works like this: if a man
says ‘I am lying’ we say that it follows that he is not lying, from
which it follows that he is lying and so on. Well, so what? You can go
on like that until you are black in the face. Why not? It doesn’t
matter.</p>
<p>What was puzzling about this sort of paradox, Turing tried to
explain, is ‘that one usually uses a contradiction as a criterion for
having done something wrong. But in this case one cannot find anything
done wrong.’ Yes, replied Wittgenstein, because nothing has been done
wrong: ‘One may say, “This can only be explained by a theory of types.”
But what is there which needs to be explained?’</p>
<p>Turing clearly needed to explain, not only why it was puzzling, but
also why it mattered. The real harm of a system that contains a
contradiction, he suggested, ‘will not come in unless there is an
application, in which case a bridge may fall down or something of the
sort’.38 In the following lecture, he returned to the fray, and almost
the entire lecture was taken up with a debate between the two on the
importance of discovering ‘hidden contradictions’:</p>
<p>Turing: You cannot be confident about applying your calculus until
you know that there is no hidden contradiction in it.39</p>
<p>Wittgenstein: There seems to me to be an enormous mistake there. For
your calculus gives certain results, and you want the bridge not to
break down. I’d say things can go wrong in only two ways: either the
bridge breaks down or you have made a mistake in your calculation – for
example you multiplied wrongly. But you seem to think there may be a
third thing wrong: the calculus is wrong.</p>
<p>Turing: No. What I object to is the bridge falling down.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein: But how do you know that it will fall down? Isn’t that
a question of physics? It may be that if one throws dice in order to
calculate the bridge it will never fall down.</p>
<p>Turing: If one takes Frege’s symbolism and gives someone the
technique of multiplying in it, then by using a Russell paradox he could
get a wrong multiplication.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein: This would come to doing something which we would not
call multiplying. You give him a rule for multiplying and when he gets
to a certain point he can go in either of two ways, one of which leads
him all wrong.</p>
<p>‘You seem to be saying’, suggested Turing, ‘that if one uses a little
common sense, one will not get into trouble.’40 ‘No’, thundered
Wittgenstein, ‘that is NOT what I mean at all.’ His point was rather
that a contradiction cannot lead one astray because it leads nowhere at
all. One cannot calculate wrongly with a contradiction, because one
simply cannot use it to calculate. One can do nothing with
contradictions, except waste time puzzling over them.</p>
<p>After two more lectures Turing stopped attending, convinced, no
doubt, that if Wittgenstein would not admit a contradiction to be a
fatal flaw in a system of mathematics, then there could be no common
ground between them. It must indeed have taken a certain amount of
courage to attend the classes as the single representative of all that
Wittgenstein was attacking, surrounded by Wittgenstein’s acolytes and
having to discuss the issues in a way that was unfamiliar to him. Andrew
Hodges, in his excellent biography of Turing, expresses surprise at what
he sees as Turing’s diffidence in these discussions, and gives as an
example the fact that, despite long discussions about the nature of a
‘rule’ in mathematics, Turing never offered a definition in terms of
Turing machines.41 But, surely, Turing realized that Wittgenstein would
have dismissed such a definition as irrelevant; the discussion was
conducted at a more fundamental level. Wittgenstein was attacking, not
this or that definition, but the very motivation for providing such
definitions.</p>
<p>With the certain exception of Alister Watson, and the possible
exception of others, it is likely that many of those who attended these
lectures did not fully grasp what was at stake in the arguments between
Wittgenstein and Turing, nor fully understand how radically
Wittgenstein’s views broke with anything that had previously been said
or written on the philosophy of mathematics. They were, on the whole,
more interested in Wittgenstein than in mathematics. Norman Malcolm, for
one, has said that, though he was aware that ‘Wittgenstein was doing
something important’, he ‘understood almost nothing of the lectures’
until he restudied his notes ten years later.42</p>
<p>Malcolm was then a doctoral student at Harvard, who had arrived in
Cambridge in the Michaelmas term of 1938 to study with Moore, and
quickly fell under the spell of Wittgenstein’s personality. It is in his
memoir that that personality is most memorably and (in the opinion of
many who knew Wittgenstein) accurately described. Wittgenstein warmed to
Malcolm’s kindness and his human understanding, and during Malcolm’s
brief time at Cambridge the two became close friends. Upon Malcolm’s
return to the United States, he became, as well as a cherished
correspondent, an invaluable supplier of Wittgenstein’s favourite
journal, Street andandandand Smith’s Detective Story Magazine, at a time
when American magazines became unavailable in England.</p>
<p>Why Wittgenstein insisted – and insist he did; when Malcolm sent some
other brand, Wittgenstein gently admonished him, asking why he had tried
to be original instead of sticking to the ‘good, old, tried out stuff’ –
on Street andandandand Smith is a mystery: it was at this time
practically indistinguishable from its more famous rival, Black Mask.
Both published ‘hard-boiled’ detective stories written largely by the
same group of writers, the most famous of which are: Carroll John Daly,
Norbert Davis, Cornell Woolrich and Erle Stanley Gardner. Raymond
Chandler published but one story in Street andandandand Smith, a lesser
known piece called ‘No Crime in the Mountains’, and Dashiell Hammett
had, by this time, given up writing for the ‘pulps’ altogether.</p>
<p>In one respect, at least, the ethos of the hard-boiled detective
coincides with Wittgenstein’s own: they both, in their different ways,
decry the importance of the ‘science of logic’, exemplified in the one
case by Principia Mathematica and in the other by Sherlock Holmes. ‘I am
not the deducting, deducing book type of detective’, explains Race
Williams in a typical Street andandandand Smith story:43</p>
<p>I’m a hard working, plugging sort of guy who can recognize a break
when I see it and act at the same minute, at the same second or even
split second if guns are brought into it.</p>
<p>This fast-acting, fast-shooting, honest sort of a guy bears an
obvious similarity to movie cowboys, and it is probably no coincidence
that the Western was Wittgenstein’s favourite genre. By the late 1930s,
however, his taste had broadened to include musicals. His favourite
actresses, he told Malcolm, were Carmen Miranda and Betty Hutton.
Exhausted and disgusted by his lectures, he would invariably go to see a
‘flick’ after them, accompanied by Malcolm, Smythies or one of his other
friends from the class. He would always sit at the front of the cinema,
where he could be totally immersed in the picture. He described the
experience to Malcolm as ‘like a shower bath’, washing away his thoughts
of the lecture.</p>
<p>It was the custom at that time to play the national anthem at the end
of the film, at which point the audience was expected to rise to their
feet and stand respectfully still. This was a ceremony that Wittgenstein
could not abide, and he would dash out of the cinema before it could
begin. He also found the movie newsreels, which used to be shown between
films, unbearable. As war with Germany approached, and the newsreels
became more and more patriotic and jingoistic, Wittgenstein’s anger
increased. Among his papers there is a draft of a letter addressed to
their makers, accusing them of being ‘master pupils of Goebbels’. It was
at this time that his friendship with Gilbert Pattisson, of ten years’
standing, came to an end, when he perceived in Pattisson’s attitude to
the war something he took to be jingoism. His friendship with Norman
Malcolm was threatened by a similar issue. Passing a newspaper vendor’s
sign which announced the German government’s accusation that the British
had attempted to assassinate Hitler, Wittgenstein commented that he
would not be surprised if it were true. Malcolm demurred. Such an act
was, he said, incompatible with the British ‘national character’,
Wittgenstein reacted angrily to this ‘primitive’ remark:</p>
<p>… what is the use of studying philosophy if all that it does for you
is to enable you to talk with some plausibility about some abstruse
questions of logic, etc., andandandand if it does not improve your
thinking about the important questions of everyday life, if it does not
make you more conscientious than any … journalist in the use of the
DANGEROUS phrases such people use for their own ends.44</p>
<p>The rift healed before Malcolm’s return to the United States in
February 1940, but for a time Wittgenstein ceased his habit of taking a
walk with Malcolm before his lectures.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had reason to be wary of the nationalist sentiment and
anti-German feeling that was being whipped up in readiness for the
coming war. On the day that war was declared, 3 September 1939, he and
Skinner were in Wales, visiting Drury and staying in an hotel in
Pontypridd. The following morning he was told to report to the local
police station, his German name having aroused the suspicions of the
hotel manageress. By this time he was a British national, and he had no
trouble establishing the fact, but, as he said to Skinner and Drury, he
would in future have to be very careful.</p>
<p>For the first two years of the war Wittgenstein was forced to remain
a lecturer at Cambridge, despite strenuous efforts to find alternative
work related to the war effort, such as joining the ambulance brigade.
In September 1937, when things had been going badly with his work, he
had urged himself to do something else. But: ‘how should I find the
strength to do something different now’ he had asked, ‘unless I were
being forced, as in a war?’ When war did come he found that, far from
forcing him to do something else, it was preventing him from doing so.45
The doors to his doing something ‘useful’ were closed by his German name
and Austrian background. While he continued to lecture and to work on
the second half of his book, he longed to get away from Cambridge and to
be, in some way or other, engaged in the struggle. ‘I feel I will die
slowly if I stay there’, he told John Ryle.46 ‘I would rather take a
chance of dying quickly.’</p>
<p>He tried, unsuccessfully, to dissuade Malcolm from an academic career
(Smythies, he felt sure, would never be offered an academic appointment
anyway – he was ‘too serious’). Couldn’t Malcolm do some manual work
instead? On a ranch or on a farm, say? Malcolm declined. He returned to
Harvard, collected his Ph.D. and took up a teaching post at Princeton.
In his letters Wittgenstein repeated his warnings. Congratulating
Malcolm on his doctorate, he urged him to make good use of it and not to
cheat himself or his students: ’Because, unless I’m very much mistaken,
that’s what will be expected from you.’47 Wishing him luck with his
academic appointment, he stressed again that the temptation for Malcolm
to cheat himself would be overwhelming: ’Only by a miracle will you be
able to do decent work in teaching philosophy.’48</p>
<p>By the time war broke out, Skinner’s period as an apprentice at the
Cambridge Instrument Company had come to an end, and he seems to have
made an attempt to return to theoretical work. In a letter dated 11
October 1939, written from Leeds, he mentions collaborating on a book
(one assumes a mathematics textbook) with his old mathematics tutor,
Ursell. The project was presumably abandoned (at least, I have been able
to find no trace of such a book being published). In the letter Skinner
says how difficult he now finds this sort of work, and mentions that he
may soon return to Cambridge to look for a job. He also alludes to some
sort of break between himself and Wittgenstein, a problem in their
relationship, for which, characteristically, he assumes full blame:</p>
<p>I feel very unhappy that I should have given you cause to write that
you feel I’m away from you.49 It’s a terrible thing that I have acted in
a way that might loosen what is between us. It would be a catastrophe
for me if anything happened to our relation. Please forgive me for what
I have done.</p>
<p>What he had done he does not say, and no doubt did not know; he knew
only that he was losing Wittgenstein’s love. After his return to
Cambridge, he and Wittgenstein lived separately – he in East Road, and
Wittgenstein in his favoured set of rooms in Whewell’s Court.</p>
<p>After Skinner’s death Wittgenstein repeatedly chastized himself for
having been unfaithful to him in the last two years of his life. It is a
reasonable conjecture that this guilt is connected with Wittgenstein’s
feelings for a young working-class colleague of Skinner’s called Keith
Kirk. In 1939, Kirk, who was then nineteen, worked as an apprentice
alongside Skinner, and they became friends when he began to ask Skinner
questions about the mathematics and mechanics of the instruments they
were using. Skinner, who was too reticent to be an adequate teacher,
introduced Kirk to Wittgenstein, and from then on Wittgenstein gave Kirk
regular lessons on physics, mathematics and mechanics to help him with
the City and Guilds professional examinations for which he was then
preparing.</p>
<p>To Kirk these lessons from a Cambridge professor were nothing but an
unexpected and extremely welcome source of help, and a remarkable
opportunity. From Wittgenstein’s diary, however, it appears that he
thought rather more of the relationship than one would expect:</p>
<p>See K once or twice a week; but am doubtful whether the relationship
is the right one.50 May it be genuinely good [13 June 1940]</p>
<p>Occupied myself the whole day with thoughts of my relations with
Kirk.51 For the most part, very insincere and fruitless. If I wrote
these thoughts down, one would see how low and dishonest – how indecent
they were [7 October 1940]</p>
<p>Throughout 1940 and the first half of 1941 Kirk came regularly to
Wittgenstein’s rooms in Trinity for his unpaid lessons. Wittgenstein
taught without a textbook; instead, he would ask Kirk a series of
questions that forced him to think through the problems from first
principles. Thus, a lesson might begin with Wittgenstein asking Kirk
what happens when water boils – What are bubbles? Why do they rise to
the surface? and so on. The amount that Kirk learnt from these lessons
therefore depended to a large extent on his own ability to think, and,
as in Wittgenstein’s philosophy classes, there would frequently be long
silences. However, according to Kirk, what he learnt in these lessons
has stayed with him ever since, and the style of thinking imparted to
him by Wittgenstein has been of lasting benefit to him.</p>
<p>Kirk never had the slightest idea that Wittgenstein’s feelings for
him were anything other than those of a helpful teacher. After the
lesson he would occasionally accompany Skinner and Wittgenstein to see a
Western at the local cinema, but apart from that he saw little of
Wittgenstein outside his periods of instruction.</p>
<p>The lessons came to an end in 1941, when Kirk was sent by the
Ministry of War to work in Bournemouth on Air Ministry Research. The
move put an end to his City and Guilds studies, but not immediately to
his friendship with Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein did what he could to stay
in touch. He once went down to Bournemouth to see how Kirk was getting
on, and when Kirk came back to Cambridge Wittgenstein would invariably
arrange to meet him.</p>
<p>It was during one of these latter visits that Wittgenstein called on
Kirk in an extremely distraught state to tell him that Francis had been
taken seriously ill with polio and had been admitted into hospital. A
few days later, on 11 October 1941, Francis died.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s initial reaction was one of delicate restraint. In
letters to friends telling them of Francis’s death, he managed a tone of
quiet dignity. To Hutt, for example, he wrote:</p>
<p>My dear Ro[w]land,52</p>
<p>I have to give you very terrible news.</p>
<p>Francis fell ill four days ago with poliomyelitis andandandand died
yesterday morning. He died without any pain or struggle entirely
peacefully. I was with him. I think he has had one of the happiest lives
I’ve known anyone to have, andandandand also the most peaceful
death.</p>
<p>I wish you good and kind thoughts.</p>
<p>As always,</p>
<p>Ludwig</p>
<p>By the time of the funeral, however, his restraint had gone. He has
been described by Skinner’s sister as behaving like a ‘frightened wild
animal’ at the ceremony, and after it, she recalls, he refused to go to
the house but was seen walking round Letchworth with Dr Burnaby, the
tutor of Trinity, looking ‘quite wild’.53 He would not, in any case,
have been unreservedly welcome at the Skinner home. Skinner’s family
were always mistrustful of the influence he had exerted on their
delicate boy, and his mother, who believed that his job at the Cambridge
Instrument Company had hastened Francis’s death, refused to speak to
Wittgenstein at the funeral.</p>
<p>But Wittgenstein’s guilt over Francis was entirely unconnected with
the way in which he had influenced him. It had to do with more internal
matters – with how Wittgenstein himself had felt towards Francis during
the last few years of his life. On 28 December 1941, he wrote:</p>
<p>Think a lot about Francis, but always only with remorse over my
lovelessness; not with gratitude.54 His life and death seem only to
accuse me, for I was in the last 2 years of his life very often loveless
and, in my heart, unfaithful to him. If he had not been so boundlessly
gentle and true, I would have become totally loveless towards him.</p>
<p>Immediately after this passage he goes on to discuss his feelings for
Kirk: ‘I see Keith often, and what this really means I don’t know.
Deserved disappointment, anxiety, worry, inability to settle into a
pattern of life.’ About seven years later, in July 1948, he wrote:
’Think a great deal about the last time I was with Francis; about my
odiousness towards him … I cannot see how I can ever in my life be freed
from this guilt.’55</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s infatuation with Kirk – entirely unspoken,
unacknowledged and unreciprocated as it was – exemplifies in its purest
form a feature that had characterized his earlier loves for Pinsent and
for Marguerite; namely, a certain indifference to the feelings of the
other person. That neither Pinsent nor Marguerite – and certainly not
Kirk – were in love with him seemed not to affect his love for them.
Indeed, it perhaps made his love easier to give, for the relationship
could be conducted safely, in the splendid isolation of his own
feelings. The philosophical solipsism to which he had at one time been
attracted, and against which much of his later work is addressed (he
characterized his later work as an attempt to show the fly the way out
of the fly-bottle), has its parallel in the emotional solipsism in which
his romantic attachments were conducted. With Francis that isolation was
threatened, and, in the face of that threat, Wittgenstein had withdrawn,
like the porcupines of Schopenhauer’s fable, behind his spiky
exterior.</p>
