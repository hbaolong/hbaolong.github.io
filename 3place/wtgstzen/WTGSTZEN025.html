<h4 id="swansea">22 SWANSEA</h4>
<p>DESPITE BYWATERS’S IMPRESSION that Wittgenstein had had to leave the
research unit at Newcastle because he had been ‘called back to his
Cambridge Chair’, Wittgenstein was determined to avoid going back to
Cambridge if at all possible. He wanted to finish his book before he
resumed his duties as a professor, and for that purpose he considered
Swansea a much better place. The thought of going to Swansea had
occurred to him the previous December, after he had been told that Grant
and Reeve would have to leave Newcastle in the new year. He wanted, as
he had said in a letter to Malcolm, to be with someone with whom he
could discuss philosophy, and Rhees was the obvious choice. ‘I don’t
know if you remember Rhees’, he wrote.1 ‘You saw him in my lectures I
believe. He was a pupil of Moore’s andandandand is an excellent man
andandandand has a real talent for philosophy, too.’</p>
<p>A week before he left Newcastle, however, it suddenly occurred to him
that he might not be able to spend a long period working in Swansea. As
he explained to Rhees, he was on leave of absence from his duties as a
professor because he was doing ‘important’ war work:</p>
<p>If, e.g., I leave here andandandand try to find another job, say in a
hospital, I have to let the general Board know andandandand they have to
approve the new job.2 Now if I come to Cambridge next week they’ll want
to know what I’m doing andandandand I’ll have to tell them that I want
to do some philosophy for a couple of months. And in this case they can
say: if you want to do philosophy you’re not doing a war job
andandandand have to do your philosophy in Cambridge.</p>
<p>… I’m almost sure that I couldn’t work at Cambridge now! I hope I’ll
be able to come to Swansea.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s fears proved to be unfounded, and after spending a few
weeks in Cambridge he was granted leave of absence to go to Swansea to
work on his book. He left Cambridge in March 1944, and did not have to
return until the following autumn.</p>
<p>The prospect of daily discussions with Rhees was not the only
attraction of Swansea. Wittgenstein loved the Welsh coastline, and,
perhaps more important, found the people in Swansea more congenial than
those in Cambridge. ‘The weather’s foul’, he was to tell Malcolm in
1945, ‘but I enjoy not being in Cambridge’:3</p>
<p>I know quite a number of people here whom I like. I seem to find it
more easy to get along with them here than in England. I feel much more
often like smiling, e.g. when I walk in the street, or when I see
children, etc.</p>
<p>Through an advertisement in a newspaper, Rhees found lodgings for him
in the home of a Mrs Mann, who lived by the coast at Langland Bay. So
ideal was this position that when Mrs Mann wrote to Wittgenstein
explaining that she had changed her mind and could not, after all, take
him in as a lodger, he refused to accept it and insisted on moving in
regardless. He stayed with her throughout the spring of 1944, and she
indeed proved to be a good landlady, taking good care of him throughout
his periodic bouts of ill health.</p>
<p>Soon after he moved in with Mrs Mann he entered into a correspondence
with Rowland Hutt which illustrates something of what Fania Pascal may
have had in mind when she wrote that, if you had committed a murder, or
if you were about to change your faith, Wittgenstein would be the best
man to consult, but that for more ordinary anxieties and fears he could
be dangerous: ’his remedies would be all too drastic, surgical. He would
treat you for original sin.’4</p>
<p>Hutt was at this time serving in the Royal Army Medical Corps and was
dissatisfied with his position. He hoped to be given a commission and to
be able to work in a laboratory or an operating theatre. Deeply
depressed, he wrote to Wittgenstein complaining of his situation. Though
he always encouraged any desire to take on a medical position,
Wittgenstein treated Hutt’s problem as one of the soul rather than one
concerning his career. ‘I hadn’t a good impression from your letter’, he
wrote to Hutt on 17 March.5 ‘Though it’s very difficult for me to say
what’s wrong’:</p>
<p>I feel as though you were getting more and more slovenly. I’m not
blaming you for it, andandandand I’ld have no right to do so. But I’ve
been thinking what’s to be done about it. Seeing a psychologist – unless
he is a very extraordinary man – won’t get you far.</p>
<p>He was, in any case, inclined to doubt whether Hutt would be
particularly good in an operating theatre: ‘You’ve got to be rather
quick there andandandand resourceful, andandandand I just don’t know if
you are.’ But: ‘One thing seems to me fairly clear: that you mustn’t go
on in a humiliating or demoralising position.’ The central problem, as
Wittgenstein saw it, was that of preserving Hutt’s self-respect. If he
couldn’t get a commission, and if he was not prepared to make a good job
of whatever he was doing, then he should apply to be sent, in whatever
capacity he could, to a unit near the Front. There, Wittgenstein told
him, ‘you’ll at least live some sort of life’:</p>
<p>I have extremely little courage myself, much less than you; but I
have found that whenever, after a long struggle, I have screwed my
courage up to do something I always felt much freer andandandand happier
after it.</p>
<p>‘I know that you have a family’, he wrote, anticipating the most
obvious objection to the wisdom of this advice, ‘but you won’t be any
use to your family if you’re no use to yourself.’ And if Lotte, Hutt’s
wife, did not see this now, ‘she’ll see it one day’.</p>
<p>This piece of advice, like others that Wittgenstein gave friends
during the Second World War, is quite obviously based on his own
experience of the Great War. For example, before he left to embark for
‘D-Day’ Maurice Drury came to Swansea to say goodbye to Wittgenstein,
who left him with these words:</p>
<p>If it ever happens that you get mixed up in hand-to-hand fighting,
you must just stand aside and let yourself be massacred.6</p>
<p>‘I felt’, writes Drury, ‘that this advice was one that he had had to
give himself in the previous war.’ Similarly, when Norman Malcolm
enlisted in the US Navy he was sent by Wittgenstein a ‘foul copy’
(presumably second-hand and a bit scruffy) of Gottfried Keller’s novel
Hadlaub. The advantage of its not being in pristine condition,
Wittgenstein wrote, ‘is that you can read it down in the engine-room
without making it more dirty’.7 He obviously pictured Malcolm working in
some manual capacity on a steam vessel similar to the Goplana. It is as
though the war gave him the opportunity of vicariously reliving, through
his younger friends, the intense and transforming events of 1914–18.</p>
<p>If he had been in Hutt’s position, one feels, he would have had no
hesitation in applying to be sent to the Front – just as he had in
1915.</p>
<p>But his advice to Hutt was also based on a more general attitude. ‘I
think’, he told him, ‘you must stop creeping andandandand start walking
again’:8</p>
<p>When I talked of courage, by the way, I didn’t mean, make a row with
your superiors; particularly not when it’s entirely useless andandandand
just shooting off your mouth. I meant: take a burden andandandand try to
carry it. I know that I’ve not any right to say this. I’m not much good
at carrying burdens myself. But still it’s all I’ve got to say; until
perhaps I can see you.</p>
<p>Hutt wrote back showing no inclination to accept the advice and
reporting that he had recently seen a psychologist. ‘I wish I knew more
about military matters’, Wittgenstein replied with impatient irony:9</p>
<p>I can’t understand, e.g., what a psychologist has to do with your
medical category in the Army. Surely there’s nothing wrong with you
mentally! (Or if there is the psychologist won’t know it.)</p>
<p>He repeated the outlines of his previous advice. If he couldn’t get a
commission, then the only thing for Hutt to do was: ‘To do the job which
you’ve got really well; so well that you don’t lose your self-respect
doing it’:</p>
<p>I don’t know if you understand me. It is an intelligent thing to do
to use whatever means one has to get a better, or more suitable job. But
if those means fail then there comes a moment when it no longer makes
sense always to complain andandandand to kick but when you’ve got to
settle down. You’re like a man who moves into a room andandandand says
‘Oh this is only temporary’ andandandand doesn’t unpack his trunks. Now
this is all right – for a time. But if he can’t find a better place, or
can’t make up his mind to risk moving perhaps into another town
altogether, then the thing to do is to unpack his trunks andandandand
settle down whether the room’s good or not. For anything’s better than
to live in a state of waiting.</p>
<p>‘This war will end’, he insisted, ‘andandandand the most important
thing is what sort of person you’ll be when it’s over. That’s to say:
when it’s over you ought to be a man. And you won’t be if you don’t
train yourself now’:</p>
<p>The first thing to do is: stop kicking when it’s fruitless. It seems
to me you ought either apply to be posted somewhere nearer the front
andandandand just risk it, or, if you don’t want to do that, sit down
where you are, don’t think of moving but only of doing that work well
which you’ve got now.10</p>
<p>‘I’ll be quite frank with you’, he added, with another suggestion
that indicates he was perhaps projecting his own history on to Hutt’s
situation, ‘andandandand say that I think it might be better for you not
to be within reach of your family’:</p>
<p>Your family is, of course, soothing, but it may also have a softening
effect. And for certain sores you want to make the skin harder, not
softer. I mean, I have an idea (perhaps it’s as wrong as hell) that your
family makes it more difficult, or impossible, for you to settle down
andandandand get down to your work without looking right or left. Also
you should perhaps look a little more inside you, andandandand this also
is perhaps impossible with your family around. In case you show this
letter to Lotte andandandand she wildly disagrees with me I’ll say this:
maybe she wouldn’t be a good wife if she didn’t disagree, but that
doesn’t mean that what I tell you mayn’t be true!</p>
<p>Still hankering after a commission, Hutt wrote telling Wittgenstein
he had seen his commander and might do so again soon. ‘It seems to me’,
Wittgenstein replied, ‘that you’re alternatively living in unfounded
hopes andandandand in despair … To pester your Commander about a
commission now seems to me silly. Nothing has changed since you’ve been
refused!’</p>
<p>You write: ‘All these steps have made or will make my position here
satisfactory, or at least a lot better.’ This is all nonsense,
andandandand it makes me really sick to read it. The one step which can
make things more satisfactory for you is a step that has to be taken
inside you. (Though I won’t say that getting away from your family
mightn’t help.)</p>
<p>The exchange on this subject ended in June, with Wittgenstein having
the last word. ‘I wish you luck and patience!’ he wrote in conclusion,
’andandandand no more dealings with psychologists.’11</p>
<p>By this time, Wittgenstein had moved out of Mrs Mann’s house and into
the home of a Methodist minister, the Reverend Wynford Morgan. On his
first visit to the house Mrs Morgan, acting the solicitous hostess,
asked him whether he would like some tea, and also whether he would like
this and that other thing. Her husband called out to her from another
room: ‘Do not ask; give.’ It was a remark that impressed Wittgenstein
enormously, and he repeated it to his friends on a number of
occasions.</p>
<p>But in other respects Wittgenstein was less favourably impressed with
his host. He made fun of him for having his walls lined with books that
he never read, accusing him of having them there simply to impress his
flock. When Morgan asked Wittgenstein whether he believed in God, he
replied: ’Yes I do, but the difference between what you believe and what
I believe may be infinite.’12</p>
<p>This remark does not, of course, refer to the difference between
Methodism and other forms of Christianity. Wittgenstein was no more a
Catholic than he was a Methodist. Of his friends who had converted to
Catholicism, he once remarked: ‘I could not possibly bring myself to
believe all the things that they believe.’ One of these was Yorick
Smythies, who wrote to Wittgenstein announcing his conversion at the
time that Wittgenstein was lodging with Reverend Morgan. Wittgenstein
was very concerned, the more so as he thought he might have unwittingly
been partly responsible for the conversion by encouraging Smythies to
read Kierkegaard. His reply to Smythies was oblique: ’If someone tells
me he has bought the outfit of a tightrope walker I am not impressed
until I see what is done with it.’13</p>
<p>The point of this analogy is clarified in one of his notebooks:</p>
<p>An honest religious thinker is like a tightrope walker.14 He almost
looks as though he were walking on nothing but air. His support is the
slenderest imaginable. And yet it really is possible to walk on it.</p>
<p>Though he had the greatest admiration for those who could achieve
this balancing act, Wittgenstein did not regard himself as one of them.
He could not, for example, bring himself to believe in the literal truth
of reported miracles:</p>
<p>A miracle is, as it were, a gesture which God makes.15 As a man sits
quietly and then makes an impressive gesture, God lets the world run on
smoothly and then accompanies the words of a saint by a symbolic
occurrence, a gesture of nature. It would be an instance if, when a
saint has spoken, the trees around him bowed, as if in reverence. – Now,
do I believe this happens? I don’t.</p>
<p>The only way for me to believe in a miracle in this sense would be to
be impressed by an occurrence in this particular way. So that I should
say e.g.: ‘It was impossible to see these trees and not to feel that
they were responding to the words.’ Just as I might say ‘It is
impossible to see the face of this dog and not to see that he is alert
and full of attention to what his master is doing.’ And I can imagine
that the mere report of the words and life of a saint can make someone
believe the reports that the tree bowed. But I am not so impressed.</p>
<p>The belief in God which he acknowledged to Morgan did not take the
form of subscribing to the truth of any particular doctrine, but rather
that of adopting a religious attitude to life. As he once put it to
Drury: ’I am not a religious man but I cannot help seeing every problem
from a religious point of view.’16</p>
<p>Next door to Morgan lived the Clement family, with whom Wittgenstein
quickly made friends – a good example of his remark to Malcolm that he
found it easier to get along with people in Swansea than in England. He
particularly liked Mrs Clement, who invited him to have Sunday lunch
with her family every week. ‘Isn’t she an angel?’ he said of her to her
husband one Sunday lunch-time.17 ‘Is she?’ replied Mr Clement. ‘Damn it
all, man! of course she is!’ roared Wittgenstein. In fact, he was so
impressed by Mrs Clement that he wished to lodge in her house rather
than with Morgan. The Clements had not until then taken lodgers, and had
no great desire to do so, but, on being pressed, they assented to
Wittgenstein’s moving in. Wittgenstein’s association with the Clements
lasted for the next three years, and during his last years at Cambridge
he would spend his vacations as a guest in their home.</p>
<p>The Clements had two daughters, Joan, aged eleven, and Barbara, aged
nine, and while he was staying there Wittgenstein was treated almost as
part of the family. Finding the name ‘Wittgenstein’ something of a
mouthful, they all called him ‘Vicky’, although it was made clear that
they were the only people allowed to do so. Unusually, Wittgenstein took
his meals with the family while he was staying with the Clements. He
also joined in with other aspects of family life. In particular, he
enjoyed playing Ludo and Snakes and Ladders with the girls – so much so
that on one occasion, when a game of Snakes and Ladders in which
Wittgenstein was particularly absorbed had gone on for over two hours,
the girls had to plead with him against his will to leave the game
unresolved.</p>
<p>He took an active interest, too, in the education of the two girls.
The elder, Joan, was at the time taking her scholarship examinations for
the local grammar school. On the day that the results were announced,
Wittgenstein came home to find her in tears. She had been told that she
had failed. Wittgenstein was emphatic that this could not be so. ‘Damn
it all!’ he said. ‘We’ll see about that!’ With Joan and her mother
following anxiously, Wittgenstein marched down to Joan’s school to
confront the teacher who had told her that she had failed. ‘I am stunned
that you say she failed’, he told the teacher, ‘and I can tell you on
authority that she must have passed.’ The somewhat intimidated teacher
checked the records and discovered, much to everybody’s relief, that
there had indeed been a mistake and that Joan had gained enough marks to
pass the examination. The teacher was denounced as an ‘incompetent fool’
by Wittgenstein, but although both his judgement and Joan’s ability had
been vindicated, Mrs Clement was ashamed to show her face again at the
school.</p>
<p>Apart from his self-imposed family responsibilities and his almost
daily walks with Rhees, Wittgenstein’s time at Swansea was taken up
largely with writing. He had taken with him the typescript of the 1938
version of the Investigations, and the notebooks and hard-back ledger
volumes that he had written while he had been working at Guy’s, and he
set to work on a revision of the book which he hoped would be ready for
the publishers by the time he had to return to Cambridge the following
autumn.</p>
<p>For the first two months that he was in Swansea, the focus of his
work was on the philosophy of mathematics. He resumed work on the
notebook he had kept at Guy’s and to which he had given the title
‘Mathematics and Logic’. His chief preoccupation in this notebook is
with the notion of following a rule. Part 1 of the 1938 version had
ended with remarks concerning the confusions associated with this
notion, and Part 2 began with an attempt to unravel these confusions as
a preliminary to a discussion of issues in the philosophy of
mathematics. In the reworked version of the Investigations which was
published after his death, however, the discussion of following a rule
is used instead as a preliminary to a discussion of issues in the
philosophy of psychology. This change was effected in Swansea in the
spring and summer months of 1944.</p>
<p>How quickly and radically Wittgenstein’s interests shifted while he
was at Swansea is illustrated by two incidents that are separated only
by a few months. The first occurred soon after he had moved there, and
is connected with a short biographical paragraph that John Wisdom was
writing of Wittgenstein for inclusion in a biographical dictionary.
Before publication, Wisdom sent the piece to Wittgenstein for his
comments. Wittgenstein made only one change; he added a final sentence
to the paragraph, which read: ‘Wittgenstein’s chief contribution has
been in the philosophy of mathematics.’18 Two or three months later,
when Wittgenstein was at work on the set of remarks which have since
become known as the ‘Private Language Argument’, Rhees asked him: ‘What
about your work on mathematics?’ Wittgenstein answered with a wave of
his hand:19 ‘Oh, someone else can do that.’</p>
<p>Of course, switching from the philosophy of mathematics to the
philosophy of psychology and back again, using the problems in one area
as analogies to illustrate points in the other, was something that
Wittgenstein had done in his lectures, notebooks and conversations since
the early 1930s. Neither was his interest in combating the idea that a
private language is possible new in 1944: he had discussed it in his
lectures as early as 1932. What is significant about the shift in 1944
is that it was permanent: Wittgenstein never again returned to the
attempt to arrange his remarks on mathematics in a publishable form, and
he spent the rest of his life arranging, rearranging and revising his
thoughts on the philosophy of psychology. Moreover, this seemingly
permanent shift came at a time when he seemed most anxious to complete
the part of his book dedicated to the philosophy of mathematics.</p>
<p>The clue to this shift, I think, lies in Wittgenstein’s changing
conception of his book, and in particular in his recognition that his
remarks on following a rule should serve, not as a preliminary to his
discussion of mathematics, but rather as an overture to his
investigations of both mathematical and psychological concepts. Despite
his remark to Rhees that ‘someone else can do that’, and despite the
fact that he never returned to his work on mathematics, Wittgenstein
continued to regard his remarks on mathematics as belonging to his
Philosophical Investigations. Thus the preface to the book, written in
1945, still lists ‘the foundations of mathematics’ as one of the
subjects about which the book is concerned, and as late as 1949 he wrote
in one of his notebooks:</p>
<p>I want to call the enquiries into mathematics that belong to my
Philosophical Investigations ‘Beginnings of Mathematics’.20</p>
<p>So the change should be considered first and foremost as a change in
Wittgenstein’s conception of the force of his remarks on following a
rule. They now led, not in one direction, but in two, and after
recognizing this fact Wittgenstein was more inclined to follow the line
that led to the investigation of psychological concepts. Although he did
not live long enough to retrace his steps and continue along the other
branch of the forked road, he did not give up his idea that it was there
to be followed. Thus the final remark of the Investigations – ‘An
investigation is possible in connexion with mathematics which is
entirely analogous to our investigation of psychology’ – ties in with
his remark to Rhees. Although he had not drawn out all the implications
of the first part of his book, it was still possible that it could be
done by someone else.</p>
<p>In conversation with Rhees Wittgenstein once remarked that he could
feel really active only when he changed his philosophical position and
went on to develop something new. He gave as an example of this
something that he considered to be an important change in his
philosophical logic, concerning his view of the relation between
‘grammatical’ and ‘material’ propositions. Previously, he said, he had
regarded this distinction to be fixed. But now he thought that the
boundary between the two was fluid and susceptible to change. In truth,
this appears as a change of emphasis rather than of opinion, for even in
the 1938 version of the Investigations he had not treated the
distinction as fixed. But neither had he particularly emphasized its
fluidity. And it is this emphasis that dictated the course of his work
in the summer of 1944.</p>
<p>The distinction between the two types of proposition lies at the
heart of Wittgenstein’s entire philosophy: in his thinking about
psychology, mathematics, aesthetics and even religion, his central
criticism of those with whom he disagrees is that they have confused a
grammatical proposition with a material one, and have presented as a
discovery something that should properly be seen as a grammatical (in
Wittgenstein’s rather odd sense of the word) innovation.</p>
<p>Thus, in his view, Freud did not discover the unconscious; rather, he
introduced terms like ‘unconscious thoughts’ and ‘unconscious motives’
into our grammar of psychological description. Similarly, Georg Cantor
did not discover the existence of an infinite number of infinite sets;
he introduced a new meaning of the word ‘infinite’ such that it now
makes sense to talk of a hierarchy of different infinities. The question
to ask of such innovations is not whether these ‘newly discovered’
entities exist or not, but whether the additions they have made to our
vocabulary and the changes they have introduced to our grammar are
useful or not. (Wittgenstein’s own view was that Freud’s were and that
Cantor’s were not.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had many ways of characterizing grammatical propositions
– ‘self-evident propositions’, ‘concept-forming propositions’, etc. –
but one of the most important was in describing them as rules. In
emphasizing the fluidity of the grammatical/material distinction, he was
drawing attention to the fact that concept-formation – and thus the
establishing of rules for what it does and does not make sense to say –
is not something fixed by immutable laws of logical form (as he had
thought in the Tractatus) but is something that is always linked with a
custom, a practice. Thus, different customs or practices would
presuppose different concepts from the ones we find useful. And this in
turn would involve the acceptance of different rules (to determine what
does and does not make sense) to the ones we, in fact, have adopted.</p>
<p>The concern with grammatical propositions was central to
Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics because he wanted to show that
the ‘inexorability’ of mathematics does not consist in certain knowledge
of mathematical truths, but rather in the fact that mathematical
propositions are grammatical. The certainty of ‘2 + 2 = 4’ consists in
the fact that we do not use it as a description but as a rule.</p>
<p>In his last writings on the philosophy of mathematics – as in his
conversation with Rhees – Wittgenstein was increasingly concerned with
the connection between rule-following and customs:</p>
<p>The application of the concept of ‘following a rule’ presupposes a
custom.21 Hence it would be nonsense to say: just once in the world
someone followed a rule (or a signpost; played a game, uttered a
sentence, or understood one; and so on).</p>
<p>This is such a general point that in the notebook from which the
remark comes – written in 1944 – it is not obvious that Wittgenstein has
mathematics in mind at all. And the connection between this point and
Wittgenstein’s argument against the possibility of a private language is
obvious:</p>
<p>I may give a new rule today, which has never been applied, and yet is
understood. But would it be possible, if no rule had ever actually been
applied?22</p>
<p>And if it is now said: ‘Isn’t it enough for there to be an imaginary
application?’ the answer is: No.</p>
<p>In this way it seemed perfectly natural to restructure the book so
that the section on following a rule led not into the philosophy of
mathematics but into the argument against the possibility of a private
language. In the work that he did during this summer Wittgenstein
extended Part I of the 1938 version of Investigations to about double
its previous length, adding to it what are now considered to be the
central parts of the book: the section on rule-following (paragraphs
189–242 of the published version), and the section on the ‘privacy of
experience’ (the so-called ‘Private Language Argument’ in paragraphs
243–421).</p>
<p>In August he began to make what looks like an attempt at a final
arrangement of the book, which he intended to have finished before he
left Swansea in the autumn. Then, he told Hutt, ‘I’ll probably take on a
war-job again.’23 In a later letter, of 3 September, he writes: ‘What
‘I’ll do when I have to leave at the beginning of Oct.24 I don’t yet
know andandandand I hope events will take the decision out of my hands.’
With the Allies making swift progress through France, and the Russians
advancing on Poland, it was by now clear that the war would end soon
with a defeat for Germany. In this Wittgenstein saw no grounds for
rejoicing. ‘I’m pretty sure’, he told Hutt, ‘that the peace after this
war will be more horrible than the war itself.’</p>
<p>Whether because he could not find a suitable war job, or because his
leave of absence could not be extended, when the time came to leave
Swansea, Wittgenstein was forced to return to Cambridge. He did so
grudgingly, not least because his book remained unfinished. Before he
left Swansea he had a typescript prepared of the parts he regarded as
publishable. (This more or less corresponds to the final version up to
paragraph 421.) Having given up hope of arranging to his satisfaction
the section of the book he had previously considered the most important
(that on the philosophy of mathematics), his one remaining hope was to
complete his ‘first volume’: his analysis of psychological concepts.</p>
