<h4 id="acknowledgements">ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h4>
<p>MY FIRST THANKS must go to Monica Furlong, without whose support this
book would never have been started. It was she who persuaded David
Godwin (then Editorial Director of Heinemann) to consider the
possibility of financing the project. No less essential has been the
undying enthusiasm and kind encouragement of David Godwin himself and
the equally unstinting support given me by my American publisher, Erwin
Glikes of the Free Press.</p>
<p>It was initially feared that the project would founder for lack of
co-operation from Wittgenstein’s literary heirs. I am happy to report
that the exact opposite has been the case. Wittgenstein’s three literary
executors, Professor Georg Henrik von Wright, Professor G. E. M.
Anscombe and the late Mr Rush Rhees have all been exceptionally kind,
co-operative and helpful. In addition to granting me permission to quote
from Wittgenstein’s unpublished manuscripts, they have been assiduous in
replying to my many questions and very generous in providing me with
information that I would not otherwise have found out.</p>
<p>To Professor von Wright I am particularly grateful for his very
patient and detailed replies to my (initially rather primitive)
speculations concerning the composition of Philosophical Investigations.
His articles on the origins of Wittgenstein’s two great works and his
meticulous cataloguing of Wittgenstein’s papers have been indispensable.
Professor Anscombe agreed to meet me on a number of occasions to speak
to me about her own memories of Wittgenstein and to answer my enquiries.
To her I am especially grateful, for allowing me access to Francis
Skinner’s letters to Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>The kindness shown to me by Mr Rhees was far above and beyond the
call of duty. Despite his advancing years and frail health he devoted
many hours to discussions with me; during which he revealed his
incomparable knowledge of Wittgenstein’s work and his many insights into
both Wittgenstein’s personality and his philosophy. He further showed me
many documents, the existence of which I would not otherwise have known.
So concerned was he to impart to me as much of what he knew as possible
that on one occasion he insisted on paying for me to stay in a hotel in
Swansea, so that our discussions would not have to be curtailed by my
having to return to London. News of his death came just as I finished
work on the book. He will be sorely missed.</p>
<p>Sadly, a number of other friends of Wittgenstein’s died while I was
researching this book. Roy Fouracre had been ill for a long time, but
his wife was kind enough to see me and to supply me with copies of the
letters from Wittgenstein to her husband. Similarly kind was Katherine
Thomson, whose late husband, Professor George Thomson, expressed a wish
to meet me shortly before he died, in order to discuss Wittgenstein’s
visit to the Soviet Union. Mrs Thomson also showed me some letters and
discussed with me her own memories of Wittgenstein. Dr Edward Bevan I
met a year or so before his death. His recollections, and those of his
widow, Joan Bevan, form the basis of Chapter 27. Tommy Mulkerrins, who
provided Wittgenstein with indispensable help during his stay on the
west coast of Ireland, was an invalided but exceptionally alert
octogenarian when I met him in his cottage in the spring of 1986. His
reminiscences have been incorporated into Chapter 25. He too, alas, is
no longer with us.</p>
<p>Other friends, happily, are alive and well. Mr Gilbert Pattisson, a
close friend of Wittgenstein’s from 1929 to 1940, met with me a number
of times and provided me with the letters quoted in Chapter 11. Mr
Rowland Hutt, a friend of both Wittgenstein and Francis Skinner, took a
lively and helpful interest in my work and provided me with the letters
quoted in Chapter 23. I am grateful also to Mr William Barrington Pink,
Sir Desmond Lee, Professor Basil Reeve, Dr Ben Richards, Dr Casimir
Lewy, Mr Keith Kirk, Mrs A. Clement, Mrs Polly Smythies, Professor Wolfe
Mays, Mrs Frances Partridge and Madame Marguerite de Chambrier, all of
whom took the trouble to speak to me – in some cases over the course of
several meetings – about their recollections of Wittgenstein. To
Professor Georg Kreisel, Professor F. A. von Hayek, Mr John King,
Professor Wasif A. Hijab, Professor John Wisdom, the late Professor Sir
Alfred Ayer and Father Conrad Pepler, I am grateful for replies by
letter to my enquiries.</p>
<p>The account of Wittgenstein’s work at Guy’s Hospital and the Royal
Infirmary at Newcastle could not have been written without the help of
Wittgenstein’s colleagues: Mr T. Lewis, Dr Humphrey Osmond, Dr R. T.
Grant, Miss Helen Andrews, Dr W. Tillman, Miss Naomi Wilkinson, Dr R. L.
Waterfeld, Dr Erasmus Barlow and Professor Basil Reeve. To Dr John
Henderson I am grateful for help in contacting many of these colleagues.
Dr Anthony Ryle kindly showed me the letter from his father quoted in
Chapter 21, and allowed me to quote from the diary he kept as a child.
To him and to Professor Reeve I am also grateful for reading and
commenting on an earlier draft of this chapter.</p>
<p>To Mr Oscar Wood, Sir Isaiah Berlin and Dame Mary Warnock I am
grateful for their recollections of the meeting of the Jowett Society
described in Chapter 24, the only occasion on which Wittgenstein took
part in a philosophical meeting at Oxford.</p>
<p>Many people who did not meet Wittgenstein also provided me with
valuable help, and in this context I am pleased to acknowledge my
gratitude to Professor W. W. Bartley III, Professor Quentin Bell, Mrs
Margaret Sloan, Mr Michael Straight, Mr Colin Wilson and Professor
Konrad Wünsche, who all replied helpfully to my letters, and to Mrs Anne
Keynes, Dr Andrew Hodges and Professor George Steiner, who were kind
enough to arrange to meet me to discuss matters arising from my
research. Mrs Keynes also kindly provided me with a dissertation on
philosophy written by her uncle, David Pinsent.</p>
<p>My research took me far and wide, but two trips in particular should
be mentioned; those to Ireland and to Austria. In Ireland I was
chauffeured around Dublin, County Wicklow and County Galway by my friend
Jonathan Culley, who showed inexhaustible patience and supplied a
much-needed (but otherwise missing) sense of urgency and punctuality. In
Dublin I was helped by Mr Paul Drury, in Wicklow by the Kingston family
and in Connemara by Tommy Mulkerrins. Mr and Mrs Hugh Price, Mrs R.
Willoughby, Mr J. Mahon and Mr Sean Kent gave much appreciated
assistance along the way. My trip to Austria was made pleasant and
comfortable by the kindness shown to me by my friend Wolfgang Grüber and
by the hospitality of his brother, Heimo. In Vienna I had the pleasure
of meeting Mrs Katrina Eisenburger, a granddaughter of Helene
Wittgenstein, and another member of the family, Dr Elizabeth Wieser. I
also received the kind help of Professor Hermann Hänsel. On my visit to
the Wechsel mountains, where Wittgenstein taught at the schools of
Trattenbach and Otterthal, I was helped enormously by Dr Adolf Hübner,
who not only escorted me around the area and supplied me with copies of
the fascinating material he has collected for the Documentation Centre
in Kirchberg, but also – with quite extraordinary kindness – took the
trouble to re-shoot a series of photographs that I had taken after it
had been discovered that my own pictures had been ruined.</p>
<p>To Dr T. Hobbs of the Wren Library, Trinity College, Cambridge; Dr A.
Baster of the Wills Library, Guy’s Hospital; Miss M. Nicholson of the
Medical Research Council Archives; and the staff of the British Library,
the Bodleian Library, Oxford, and the Cambridge University Library, I
extend my gratitude for their undying courtesy and helpful assistance.
To my friend Mr Wolf Salinger I am grateful for the trouble he took on
my behalf to uncover whatever records exist at the Technical University
of Berlin of the time that Wittgenstein spent as a student of
engineering there (when it was the Technische Hochschule). I am grateful
also to the staff of the university library for the help they gave Mr
Salinger.</p>
<p>One of the most important collections of letters used in the book is
that held by the Brenner Archive at the University of Innsbruck. This is
a collection of several hundred letters to Wittgenstein (including those
from Bertrand Russell and Gottlob Frege used in chapters 6, 7, 8 and 9)
that has only recently been made available. I am grateful to Dr P. M. S.
Hacker of St John’s College, Oxford, for drawing my attention to the
existence of this collection, and to Dr Walter Methlagl and Professor
Allan Janik of the Brenner Archive for their kindness in allowing me
access to it, and for giving up their time to discuss the contents of
the letters with me. For permission to quote these and other letters
from Bertrand Russell my thanks go to Kenneth Blackwell of the Russell
Archive, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario.</p>
<p>I owe a special debt of gratitude to Dr Michael Nedo of Trinity
College, Cambridge, whose knowledge of Wittgenstein’s manuscripts is
unrivalled, and who has, over the years, collected photographs,
documents and copies of documents connected with Wittgenstein that
constitute an immensely useful archive. He not only gave me completely
free access to this material, but also devoted much of his time to the
discussion of many and various aspects of my research. I am also greatly
indebted to him for providing me with copies of his careful
transcriptions of the coded remarks in Wittgenstein’s manuscripts.</p>
<p>Dr Paul Wijdeveld has been enormously helpful in a similarly varied
fashion. He has given me the benefit of the meticulous research he has
conducted in connection with his book on the house that Wittgenstein
designed, alerted me to the existence of published sources that I would
not otherwise have known about, and provided me with copies of drafts of
his own work and of the many documents he has discovered relating to
Wittgenstein’s relationship with Paul Engelmann.</p>
<p>For reading and passing comments on earlier drafts of parts of this
book, I am grateful to Dr G. P. Baker of St John’s College, Oxford, and
Professor Sir Peter Strawson of Magdalen College, Oxford. Dr Baker and
his colleague Dr P. M. S. Hacker were also kind enough to make available
to me work that they are currently engaged upon. Professor Stephen
Toulmin kindly read through the whole manuscript, and made a number of
helpful suggestions and constructive criticisms. My editors, David
Godwin and Erwin Glikes, have read many earlier drafts, and have also
made a great number of useful suggestions. In preparing the manuscript
for publication, Alison Mansbridge pointed out many errors that I would
not otherwise have noticed, and I am greatly indebted to her for the
enthusiasm and meticulousness with which she undertook her difficult
task. Dr David McLintock kindly checked the accuracy of my translations
of Frege’s letters and Wittgenstein’s diary entries. He made many
important corrections and drew my attention to a number of interesting
nuances and allusions I would otherwise have missed. Any errors that
remain are, of course, entirely my responsibility.</p>
<p>Without the help of my agent, Mrs Gill Coleridge, I could not have
survived the last four years. To Jenny, I owe my most heartfelt thanks
for having survived them with me.</p>
