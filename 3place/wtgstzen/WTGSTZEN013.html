<h4 id="out-of-the-wilderness">10 OUT OF THE WILDERNESS</h4>
<p>THE MOST NATURAL thing for Wittgenstein to have done in 1926, after
things had come to a head in Otterthal, might have been to avail himself
of Keynes’s hospitality and return to England. In fact, it was over a
year before he once more got in touch with Keynes. He had, he then
explained, postponed writing until he had got over the great troubles he
had experienced.</p>
<p>Although he had expected to leave Otterthal, and to abandon his
career as a teacher, the manner in which he did so left Wittgenstein
completely devastated. The trial had been a great humiliation, the more
so because, in defending himself against charges of brutality, he had
felt the need to lie about the extent of corporal punishment he had
administered in the classroom. The sense of moral failure this left him
with haunted him for over a decade, and led eventually, as we shall see,
to his taking drastic steps to purge himself of the burden of guilt.</p>
<p>In this state he could not contemplate returning to England. Nor, for
the moment, did he feel able to return to Vienna. He considered,
instead, a complete retreat from worldly troubles. Shortly after his
retirement from teaching, he called at a monastery to enquire about the
possibility of his becoming a monk. It was an idea that occurred to him
at various times in his life, often during periods of great despair. On
this occasion he was told by an obviously perceptive Father Superior
that he would not find what he expected, and that he was, in any case,
led by motives which the order could not welcome. As an alternative, he
found work as a gardener with the monk-hospitallers in Hütteldorf, just
outside Vienna, camping for three months in the tool-shed of their
garden. As it had six years earlier, gardening proved an effective
therapy, and at the end of the summer he felt able to return to Vienna
to face society.</p>
<p>On 3 June 1926, while he was still working as a gardener, his mother,
who had been ill for some time, died at the family home in the
Alleegasse, leaving Hermine as the acknowledged head of the family.
Whether or not this made it easier for Wittgenstein to return to Vienna,
or whether his mother’s death influenced him in any way, is impossible
to say. But it is striking that from this time on there is a profound
change in his attitude to his family. The family Christmas celebrations,
which in 1914 had filled him with such dread and produced in him such
confusion, were now looked forward to by him with delight. Every
Christmas from now until the Anschluss of 1938 made it impossible for
him to leave England, we find him taking part in the proceedings with
enthusiasm – distributing gifts to his nieces and nephews, and joining
in with the festive singing and dining with no hint that this
compromised his integrity.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s return to Vienna in the summer of 1926, then, appears
to mark the end of an estrangement from his family that goes back at
least to 1913, when his father died. On his return, he was offered a
kind of work-therapy which, unlike his work as a gardener, would impose
upon him the obligation to work with others, and help to bring him back
into society. It would, furthermore, allow him an opportunity to put
into practice his strongly held views on architectural aesthetics. He
was asked by his sister Gretl and by Paul Engelmann to become
Engelmann’s partner in the design and construction of Gretl’s new
house.</p>
<p>Engelmann had already carried out some work for the Wittgenstein
family. He had worked on the renovation of the family house in
Neuwaldeggergasse, and had built for Paul Wittgenstein a room in the
Alleegasse for the exhibition of his collection of porcelain. Towards
the end of 1925 he was approached by Gretl to be the architect for a new
town-house to be built on a plot of land she had bought in one of
Vienna’s least fashionable areas, on Kundmanngasse, in Vienna’s Third
District (next to the teacher training college Wittgenstein had
attended). Wittgenstein’s interest in the project was quickly aroused,
and during his last year at Otterthal, whenever he returned to Vienna,
he would discuss it with Gretl and Engelmann with great intensity and
concern, so that it seemed to Engelmann that Wittgenstein understood
Gretl’s wishes better than he did himself.</p>
<p>The early plans were drawn up by Engelmann during Wittgenstein’s last
term of teaching, but after he had left Otterthal, it seemed natural to
invite him to join him as a partner in the project. From then on, says
Engelmann: ‘he and not I was the architect, and although the ground
plans were ready before he joined the project, I consider the result to
be his and not my achievement’.1</p>
<p>The final plan is dated 13 November 1926 and is stamped: ‘P.
Engelmann andandandand L. Wittgenstein Architects’. Though he never had
any architectural training, and was involved only in this one
architectural job, there are signs that Wittgenstein began to take this
designation seriously, and to see in architecture a new vocation, a new
way of re-creating himself. For years he was listed in the Vienna city
directory as a professional architect, and his letters of the time are
written on notepaper headed: ‘Paul Engelmann andandandand Ludwig
Wittgenstein Architects, Wien III. Parkgasse 18’. Perhaps, though, this
is no more than another statement of his personal independence – an
insistence on his status as a freelance professional and a denial that
his architectural work for his sister was a mere sinecure.</p>
<p>His role in the design of the house was concerned chiefly with the
design of the windows, doors, window-locks and radiators. This is not as
marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details
that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly, house its
distinctive beauty. The complete lack of any external decoration gives a
stark appearance, which is alleviated only by the graceful proportion
and meticulous execution of the features designed by Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>The details are thus everything, and Wittgenstein supervised their
construction with an almost fanatical exactitude. When a locksmith
asked: ‘Tell me, Herr Ingenieur, does a millimetre here or there really
matter so much to you?’ Wittgenstein roared ‘Yes!’ before the man had
finished speaking.2 During discussions with the engineering firm
responsible for the high glass doors which Wittgenstein had designed,
the engineer handling the negotiations broke down in tears, despairing
of ever executing the commission in accordance with Wittgenstein’s
standards. The apparently simple radiators took a year to deliver
because no one in Austria could build the sort of thing Wittgenstein had
in mind. Castings of individual parts were obtained from abroad, and
even then whole batches were rejected as unusable. But, as Hermine
Wittgenstein recalls:</p>
<p>Perhaps the most telling proof of Ludwig’s relentlessness when it
came to getting the proportions exactly right is the fact that he had
the ceiling of one of the rooms, which was almost big enough to be a
hall, raised by three centimetres, just when it was almost time to start
cleaning the complete house.3</p>
<p>Gretl was able to move into the house at the end of 1928. According
to Hermine, it fitted her like a glove; the house was an extension of
Gretl’s personality, ‘just as from childhood onwards everything
surrounding her had to be original and grand’. For herself, however,
Hermine had reservations:</p>
<p>… even though I admired the house very much, I always knew that I
neither wanted to, nor could, live in it myself.4 It seemed indeed to be
much more a dwelling for the gods than for a small mortal like me, and
at first I even had to overcome a faint inner opposition to this ‘house
embodied logic’ as I called it, to this perfection and
monumentality.</p>
<p>It is easy to understand this slight abhorrence. The house was
designed with little regard to the comforts of ordinary mortals. The
qualities of clarity, rigour and precision which characterize it are
indeed those one looks for in a system of logic rather than in a
dwelling place. In designing the interior Wittgenstein made
extraordinarily few concessions to domestic comfort. Carpets,
chandeliers and curtains were strictly rejected. The floors were of dark
polished stone, the walls and ceilings painted a light ochre, the metal
of the windows, the door handles and the radiators was left unpainted,
and the rooms were lit with naked light-bulbs.</p>
<p>In part because of this stark monumentality, and also in part because
of the sad fate of Austria itself, the house – which had taken so much
time, energy and money to build – has had an unfortunate history. Less
then a year after Gretl moved in, the Great Crash of 1929 (though it did
not by any means leave her destitute) forced her to lay off many of the
staff she needed to run the house as it had been intended to be run, and
she took to entertaining, not in the hall, but in the kitchen. Nine
years later, after the Anschluss, she fled from the Nazis to live in New
York, leaving the house empty and in the care of the sole remaining
servant. In 1945, after the Russians occupied Vienna, the house was used
as a barracks for Russian soldiers and as a stable for their horses.
Gretl moved back in 1947 and lived there until her death in 1958, when
the house became the property of her son, Thomas Stonborough. Sharing
Hermine’s reservations about its suitability as a home, Stonborough left
it empty for many years before finally, in 1971, selling it to a
developer for demolition. It was saved from this fate only by a campaign
to have it declared a national monument by the Vienna Landmark
Commission, and now survives as a home for the Cultural Department of
the Bulgarian Embassy in Vienna, though its interior has been
extensively altered to suit its new purpose. Were Wittgenstein to see it
in its present state – room dividers removed to form L-shaped rooms,
walls and radiators painted white, the hall carpeted and wood-panelled,
and so on – it is quite possible he would have preferred it to have been
demolished.</p>
<p>Through working for Gretl, Wittgenstein was brought back into
Viennese society and, eventually, back into philosophy. While the
Kundmanngasse house was being built, Gretl and her family continued to
occupy the first floor of the Schönborn Palace. Her eldest son, Thomas,
had recently returned from Cambridge and was now reading for a Ph.D. at
the University of Vienna. At Cambridge he had met a Swiss girl by the
name of Marguerite Respinger and had invited her to Vienna. With her,
Wittgenstein began a relationship which he at least came to regard as a
preliminary to marriage, and which was to last until 1931. She was, as
far as anybody knows, the only woman with whom he fell in love.</p>
<p>Marguerite was a lively, artistic young lady from a wealthy
background, with no interest in philosophy and little of the devout
seriousness that Wittgenstein usually made a prerequisite for
friendship. Her relationship with Wittgenstein was, presumably,
encouraged by Gretl, although some of his other friends and relations
were bemused and rather less than pleased by it. She first met
Wittgenstein when, after an accident at the building site, he had hurt
his foot and was staying with Gretl’s family to convalesce. She was part
of a group of young people – which included Thomas Stonborough and the
Sjögren brothers, Talle and Arvid – which gathered round his bed to
listen to him read. He read something from the Swiss writer Johann Peter
Hebel, and, she reports: ‘I felt again at home and moved by hearing it
read with such deep understanding.’5 Much to the displeasure – and,
perhaps, jealousy – of Arvid Sjögren, Wittgenstein’s attention was drawn
to her. On a similar occasion he asked his audience what they would like
him to read, directing his question in particular to Marguerite. ‘It
doesn’t matter what you read’, Arvid commented sourly, ’she won’t
understand it.’6</p>
<p>Despite Sjögren’s disapproval, Wittgenstein and Marguerite began to
see each other almost daily. While she was in Vienna, Marguerite
attended the art school, and after her lessons would go to the
Kundmanngasse building site to meet Wittgenstein. They would then go
together to the cinema to see a Western, and eat together at a café a
simple meal consisting of eggs, bread and butter and a glass of milk. It
was not quite the style to which she was accustomed. And it required a
certain degree of courage for a respectable and fashionable young lady
like herself to be seen out with a man dressed, as Wittgenstein
invariably was, in a jacket worn at the elbows, an open-neck shirt,
baggy trousers and heavy boots. He was, moreover, nearly twice her age.
She would on occasion prefer the company of younger, more fashionable,
men like Thomas Stonborough and Talle Sjögren. This both puzzled and
angered Wittgenstein. ‘Why’, he would demand, ’do you want to go out
with a young thing like Thomas Stonborough?’7</p>
<p>To their respective friends a much more puzzling question was why
Wittgenstein and Marguerite would want to go out with one another. Arvid
Sjögren was not the only close friend of Wittgenstein’s who could not
get on with her. Another was Paul Engelmann, whom Marguerite disliked in
her turn. He was, she says, ‘the sort of Jew one didn’t like’.8 ‘One’
could presumably put up with the Wittgensteins because of their immense
wealth, their integration into Viennese society and because they were
neither religiously nor fully ‘racially’ Jewish. But Engelmann was
simply too Jewish. It may or may not be a coincidence that
Wittgenstein’s friendship with Engelmann deteriorated at the time that
his relationship with Marguerite developed, and that during the time he
was in love with her Wittgenstein’s attitude to his own Jewishness
underwent a profound change.</p>
<p>The relationship was apparently encouraged by Gretl because she
considered that Marguerite’s company would have a calming and
‘normalizing’ influence on her brother. This may have been true, and
indeed it may have been Marguerite’s very lack of intellectual depth
that enabled her to exert this influence. Wittgenstein explicitly asked
her not to try and penetrate his inner world of thought – a request with
which she was more than happy to oblige.</p>
<p>Marguerite was used as the model for a bust which Wittgenstein
sculpted at this time. The bust, executed in the studios of Michael
Drobil, is not exactly a portrait of Marguerite, for although
Wittgenstein’s interest was primarily in the attitude and expression of
the face, it was not her actual expression that he was attempting to
capture, but one that he himself was interested in creating. One is
reminded – as so often when describing Wittgenstein in love – of what
Weininger says in Sex and Character:</p>
<p>Love of a woman is possible only when it does not consider her real
qualities, and so is able to replace the actual physical reality by a
different and quite imaginary reality.9</p>
<p>When the bust was finished it was given to Gretl and displayed in the
Kundmanngasse house – an appropriate home for it, for aesthetically it
is of a piece with the house. Wittgenstein said of his excursion into
architecture:</p>
<p>… the house I built for Gretl is the product of a decidedly sensitive
ear and good manners, an expression of great understanding (of a
culture, etc.).10 But primordial life, wild life striving to erupt into
the open – that is lacking. And so you could say it isn’t healthy.</p>
<p>One could say of his sculpture, too, that it lacks ‘primordial life’.
It thus falls short, on Wittgenstein’s own terms, of being a great work
of art. For: ’Within all great art there is a WILD animal: tamed.’11
Wittgenstein himself considered the bust as no more than a clarification
of Drobil’s work.</p>
<p>Even in music, the art for which Wittgenstein had the greatest
feeling, he showed above all a great understanding, rather than
manifesting ‘wild life striving to erupt into the open’. When he played
music with others, as he did frequently during this time in Vienna, his
interest was in getting it right, in using his acutely sensitive ear to
impose upon his fellow musicians an extraordinary exactitude of
expression. One could even say that he was not interested in creating
music, but in re-creating it. When he played, he was not expressing
himself, his own primordial life, but the thoughts, the life, of others.
To this extent, he was probably right to regard himself not as creative,
but as reproductive.</p>
<p>Despite Wittgenstein’s interest in, and sensitivity to, the other
arts, it was only in philosophy that his creativity could really be
awakened. Only then, as Russell had long ago noticed, does one see in
him ‘wild life striving to erupt into the open’.</p>
<p>It was while he was working on Gretl’s house that Wittgenstein was
brought back to the activity in which he could best express his peculiar
genius. Again, Gretl acted as social catalyst, when she brought
Wittgenstein into contact with Moritz Schlick, Professor of Philosophy
at the University of Vienna.</p>
<p>In bringing these two together Gretl succeeded where Schlick himself
had, on more than one occasion over a number of years, failed. He had
arrived in Vienna in 1922, the year that the Tractatus was published,
and was one of the first people in Vienna to read it and to understand
its value. In the summer of 1924, after meeting Frank Ramsey at Gretl’s
house, he wrote to Wittgenstein, addressing his letter to Puchberg:</p>
<p>As an admirer of your Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus I have long
intended to get in touch with you.12 My professorial and other duties
are responsible for the fact that I have again and again put off
carrying out my intention, though nearly five semesters have passed
since I was called to Vienna. Every winter semester I have regular
meetings with colleagues and gifted students who are interested in the
foundations of logic and mathematics and your name has often been
mentioned in this group, particularly since my mathematical colleague
Professor Reidemaster reported on your work in a lecture which made a
great impression on us all. So there are a number of people here – I am
one myself – who are convinced of the importance and correctness of your
fundamental ideas and who feel a strong desire to play some part in
making your views more widely known.</p>
<p>In the letter Schlick suggested that he should like to visit
Wittgenstein in Puchberg. Wittgenstein had, in fact, by this time moved
to Otterthal, but the letter eventually found him there, and in his
reply he welcomed the possibility of a visit from Schlick. Schlick wrote
back quickly, announcing again his intention of coming, but it was not
until April 1926, fifteen months later, that he, accompanied by a few
chosen pupils, finally made the trip to Otterthal. Schlick’s wife has
described the spirit in which her husband undertook the journey: ’It was
as if he were preparing to go on holy pilgrimage, while he explained to
me, almost with awesome reverence, that W. was one of the greatest
geniuses on earth.’13 On arriving in Otterthal the pilgrims were deeply
disappointed to be told that Wittgenstein had resigned his post and had
left teaching.</p>
<p>Thus Schlick was overjoyed when, in February 1927, he received
Gretl’s letter inviting him to dinner to meet Wittgenstein. ‘Again’,
says Mrs Schlick, ’I observed with interest the reverential attitude of
the pilgrim.’14 Schlick had, in the meantime, sent Wittgenstein some of
his work and had proposed that Wittgenstein join him and some others in
discussions on logical problems. In her letter of invitation Gretl
responded to this proposal on Wittgenstein’s behalf. She told
Schlick:</p>
<p>He asks me to give you his warmest regards and to make his excuses to
you, since he feels quite unable to concentrate on logical problems as
well as doing his present work, which demands all his energies.15 He
could certainly not have a meeting with a number of people. He feels
that if it were with you alone, dear Professor Schlick, he might be able
to discuss such matters. It would then become apparent, he thinks,
whether he is at present at all capable of being of use to you in this
connection.</p>
<p>After meeting Wittgenstein, his wife recalls, Schlick ‘returned in an
ecstatic state, saying little, and I felt I should not ask questions’.16
The next day Wittgenstein told Engelmann: ‘Each of us thought the other
must be mad.’ Soon after this, Wittgenstein and Schlick began to meet
regularly for discussions. According to Engelmann: ‘Wittgenstein found
Schlick a distinguished and understanding partner in discussion, all the
more so because he appreciated Schlick’s highly cultured personality.’17
But Wittgenstein could not be persuaded to attend meetings of Schlick’s
‘Circle’, a group of philosophers and mathematicians, united in their
positivist approach to philosophical problems and their scientific
Weltanschauung, who met on Thursday evenings to discuss the foundations
of mathematics and science, and who later evolved into the Vienna
Circle. Wittgenstein told Schlick that he could talk only with somebody
who ‘holds his hand’.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by the summer of 1927 Wittgenstein was meeting
regularly with a group which met on Monday evenings and which included,
in addition to himself and Schlick, a few carefully chosen members of
Schlick’s Circle. These included Friedrich Waismann, Rudolf Carnap and
Herbert Feigl. The success of these meetings depended upon Schlick’s
sensitive handling of the situation. Carnap recalls that:</p>
<p>Before the first meeting Schlick admonished us urgently not to start
a discussion of the kind to which we were accustomed in the Circle,
because Wittgenstein did not want such a thing under any
circumstances.18 We should even be cautious in asking questions, because
Wittgenstein was very sensitive and easily disturbed by a direct
question. The best approach, Schlick said, would be to let Wittgenstein
talk and then ask only very cautiously for the necessary
elucidations.</p>
<p>To persuade Wittgenstein to attend these meetings Schlick had to
assure him that the discussion would not have to be philosophical; he
could discuss whatever he liked. Sometimes, to the surprise of his
audience, Wittgenstein would turn his back on them and read poetry. In
particular – as if to emphasize to them, as he had earlier explained to
von Ficker, that what he had not said in the Tractatus was more
important than what he had – he read them the poems of Rabindranath
Tagore, an Indian poet much in vogue in Vienna at that time, whose poems
express a mystical outlook diametrically opposed to that of the members
of Schlick’s Circle. It soon became apparent to Carnap, Feigl and
Waismann that the author of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus was not the
positivist they had expected. ‘Earlier’, writes Carnap:</p>
<p>when we were reading Wittgenstein’s book in the Circle, I had
erroneously believed that his attitude toward metaphysics was similar to
ours. I had not paid sufficient attention to the statements in his book
about the mystical, because his feelings and thoughts in this area were
too divergent from mine. Only personal contact with him helped me to see
more clearly his attitude at this point.</p>
<p>To the positivists, clarity went hand in hand with the scientific
method, and, to Carnap in particular, it was a shock to realize that the
author of the book they regarded as the very paradigm of philosophical
precision and clarity was so determinedly unscientific in both
temperament and method:</p>
<p>His point of view and his attitude toward people and problems, even
theoretical problems, were much more similar to those of a creative
artist than to those of a scientist; one might almost say, similar to
those of a religious prophet or a seer.19 When he started to formulate
his view on some specific philosophical problem, we often felt the
internal struggle that occurred in him at that very moment, a struggle
by which he tried to penetrate from darkness to light under an intense
and painful strain, which was even visible on his most expressive face.
When finally, sometimes after a prolonged arduous effort, his answer
came forth, his statement stood before us like a newly created piece of
art or a divine revelation. Not that he asserted his views dogmatically
… But the impression he made on us was as if insight came to him as
through a divine inspiration, so that we could not help feeling that any
sober rational comment or analysis of it would be a profanation.</p>
<p>In contrast to the members of the Circle, who considered the
discussions of doubts and objections the best way of testing an idea,
Wittgenstein, Carnap recalls, ‘tolerated no critical examination by
others, once the insight had been gained by an act of inspiration’:</p>
<p>I sometimes had the impression that the deliberately rational and
unemotional attitude of the scientist and likewise any ideas which had
the flavour of ‘enlightenment’ were repugnant to Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>Despite these differences in temperament and concerns, Wittgenstein
and the members of Schlick’s Circle were able to have a number of
profitable discussions on philosophical issues, one focus of interest
being provided by a recent paper of Frank Ramsey’s, ‘The Foundations of
Mathematics’, which Ramsey had delivered as a lecture to the London
Mathematical Society in November 1925, and which had been published in
the Society’s Proceedings.</p>
<p>This marked the beginning of Ramsey’s campaign to use the work of
Wittgenstein on logic to restore the credibility of Frege and Russell’s
logicist approach to the foundations of mathematics. Until his untimely
death in 1930, at the age of twenty-six, it was Ramsey’s overriding and
abiding aim to repair the theoretical holes in Russell’s Principia and
thus to re-establish the dominance of the logicist school of thought and
to nip in the bud the more radical alternative proposed by the
increasingly influential intuitionist school led by the Dutch
mathematician L. E. J. Brouwer. Broadly speaking, the difference is
that, whereas Russell wanted to show that all mathematics could be
reduced to logic and thus provide a rigorous logical foundation for all
the theorems accepted by pure mathematicians, Brouwer – starting from a
fundamentally different conception of both mathematics and logic –
wanted to reconstruct mathematics in such a way that only those theorems
provable from within his system were to be accepted. The rest, which
included a good number of well-established theorems, would have to be
abandoned as unproven.</p>
<p>Ramsey wanted to use the Tractatus theory of propositions to show
that mathematics consists of tautologies (in Wittgenstein’s sense), and
thus that the propositions of mathematics are simply logical
propositions. This is not Wittgenstein’s own view. In the Tractatus he
distinguishes between logical and mathematical propositions: only the
former are tautologies; the latter are ‘equations’ (TLP 6.22).</p>
<p>Ramsey’s aim was thus to show that equations are tautologies. At the
centre of this attempt was a Definition of Identity which, using a
specially defined logical function Q(x, y) as a substitute for the
expression x = y, tries, in effect, to assert that x = y is either a
tautology (if x and y have the same value) or a contradiction (if x and
y have different values). Upon this definition was built a Theory of
Functions which Ramsey hoped to use to demonstrate the tautologous
nature of mathematics. ‘Only so’, he thought, ’can we preserve it
[mathematics] from the Bolshevik menace of Brouwer and Weyl.’20</p>
<p>The paper came to Wittgenstein’s attention through Schlick, who had
been sent a copy by Ramsey. (Ramsey had not sent it to Wittgenstein
himself, because of their quarrel in the summer of 1925. ) Wittgenstein
evidently read the paper very thoroughly. On 2 July 1927 he wrote to
Ramsey criticizing his Definition of Identity at length, and expressing
the view that all such theories (those that claim expressions of
identity to be either tautologous or contradictory) would not do.
Wittgenstein himself – as Russell had discovered to his consternation in
1919 – had no stake at all in the enterprise of founding mathematics on
logic. Indeed, he considered the enterprise misguided. ‘The way out of
all these troubles’, he told Ramsey, ’is to see that neither “Q(x, y)”,
although it is a very interesting function, nor any propositional
function whatever, can be substituted for “x = y”.’21</p>
<p>Ramsey replied to Wittgenstein’s objections twice – once through
Schlick, and again directly to Wittgenstein. The gist of his defence was
that he had not intended to provide a Definition of Identity, but merely
a substitute function which was defined in such a way that it did the
job of identity statements within his theory and gave him the logical
result he wanted.</p>
<p>The exchange is interesting as an illustration of the differences
between Wittgenstein and Ramsey, and of what Wittgenstein may have meant
when he described Ramsey as a ‘bourgeois’ thinker. For whereas
Wittgenstein’s objection attempts to go straight to the heart of the
matter, and to demonstrate that Ramsey’s whole enterprise of
reconstructing Russellian foundations of mathematics was philosophically
misguided, Ramsey’s reply is concerned only with the logical and
mathematical question of whether his function will do the task for which
it was designed. Thus, according to Wittgenstein, Ramsey was ‘bourgeois’
in the sense that:</p>
<p>… he thought with the aim of clearing up the affairs of some
particular community.22 He did not reflect on the essence of the state –
or at least he did not like doing so – but on how this state might
reasonably be organized. The idea that this state might not be the only
possible one in part disquieted him and in part bored him. He wanted to
get down as quickly as possible to reflecting on the foundations – of
this state. This was what he was good at and what really interested him;
whereas real philosophical reflection disturbed him until he put its
result (if it had one) to one side and declared it trivial.</p>
<p>The political metaphor, of course, alludes to Ramsey’s remark about
the ‘Bolshevik menace’ of Brouwer, and it might be thought that, in his
use of this metaphor, Wittgenstein is equating ‘real philosophical
reflection’ with Bolshevism. This is not so. Wittgenstein was not
interested in organizing the affairs of this state (Russellian
logicism), but neither was he interested in replacing it with another
(Brouwer’s intuitionism). ‘The philosopher is not a citizen of any
community of ideas’, he wrote.23 ‘That is what makes him into a
philosopher.’</p>
<p>It was possibly this exchange with Ramsey that prompted Wittgenstein,
at last, to write to Keynes. It was the first time he had written since
he left teaching (‘I couldn’t stand the hot-water bottle any longer’, he
explained).24 He wrote to thank Keynes for his book, A Short View of
Russia, and to tell him that he expected the house on which he was
working to be finished in November of that year (1927), and that he
would then like to visit England, ‘if anybody there should care to see
me’.</p>
<p>‘About your book’, Wittgenstein wrote, ‘I forgot to say that I liked
it. It shows that you know that there are more things between heaven and
earth etc.’</p>
<p>This strange reason for liking a survey of Soviet Russia is explained
by the fact that in it Keynes emphasizes that it is as a new religion,
not as an economic innovation, that Soviet Marxism is to be admired. The
economic aspects of Leninism he dismisses as: ‘a doctrine which sets up
as its bible, above and beyond criticism, an obsolete economic textbook,
which I know to be not only scientifically erroneous but without
interest or application for the modern world’.25 But the religious
fervour accompanying this doctrine he found impressive:</p>
<p>… many, in this age without religion, are bound to feel a strong
emotional curiosity towards any religion which is really new and not
merely a recrudescence of the old ones and has proved its motive force;
and all the more when this new thing comes out of Russia, the beautiful
and foolish youngest son of the European family, with hair on his head,
nearer both to the earth and to heaven than his bald brothers in the
West – who, having been born two centuries later, has been able to pick
up the middle-aged disillusionment of the rest of the family before he
had lost the genius of youth or become addicted to comfort and to
habits.26 I sympathise with those who seek for something good in Soviet
Russia.</p>
<p>The Soviet faith is characterized by Keynes as having in common with
Christianity an exalted attitude towards the common man. But, in
contrast to Christianity, there is something in it:</p>
<p>… which may, in a changed form and a new setting, contribute
something to the true religion of the future, if there be any true
religion – Leninism is absolutely, defiantly non-supernatural, and its
emotional and ethical essence centres about the individual’s and the
community’s attitude towards the Love of Money.27</p>
<p>It is not difficult to see how such passages would have earned
Wittgenstein’s approval, nor how the faith which Keynes describes would
have earned his respect and, potentially, his allegiance. Keynes’s book,
which was written after a brief visit to the Soviet Union, contrasts
sharply with Russell’s The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism, which was
published after his own visit in 1920. Russell’s book expressed nothing
but loathing for the Soviet régime. He, too, draws a parallel with
Christianity, but uses precisely that parallel to express his
contempt:</p>
<p>One who believes as I do, that free intellect is the chief engine of
human progress, cannot but be fundamentally opposed to Bolshevism as
much as to the Church of Rome.28 The hopes which inspire communism are,
in the main, as admirable as those instilled by the Sermon on the Mount,
but they are held as fanatically and are as likely to do as much
harm.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s own interest in Soviet Russia dates from soon after
the publication of Russell’s book – almost as though he thought that if
Russell hated it so much there must be something good about it. Since
1922 (when he wrote to Paul Engelmann about ‘the idea of a possible
flight to Russia which we talked about’), Wittgenstein had been one of
those who, in Keynes’s words, ‘seek for something good in Soviet
Russia’, and he continued to be attracted to the idea of living and
working in the Soviet Union until 1937, when political circumstances
made it impossible for him to do so.</p>
<p>Although Keynes proclaims himself a non-believer, in presenting
Soviet Marxism as a faith in which there are fervently held religious
attitudes (towards, for example, the value of the common man and the
evils of money-love) but no supernatural beliefs, he has, I think,
provided an important clue as to what Wittgenstein hoped to find in
Soviet Russia.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s suggestion to Keynes that the Kundmanngasse house
would be finished by November 1927 was, for reasons already explained,
hopelessly optimistic, and it was not until a year later that he was
able to consider the proposed trip to England.</p>
<p>In the meantime he had an opportunity to see and hear for himself the
‘Bolshevik menace’ that had so disturbed Ramsey. In March 1928 Brouwer
came to Vienna to deliver a lecture entitled ‘Mathematics, Science and
Language’, which Wittgenstein attended, together with Waismann and
Feigl. After it the three spent a few hours together in a café, and,
reports Feigl:</p>
<p>… it was fascinating to behold the change that had come over
Wittgenstein that evening …29 he became extremely voluble and began
sketching ideas that were the beginnings of his later writings … that
evening marked the return of Wittgenstein to strong philosophical
interest and activities.30</p>
<p>It would be wrong to infer from Feigl’s report that Wittgenstein
underwent a sudden conversion to Brouwerian intuitionism – although
there can be no doubt that hearing Brouwer was a tremendous stimulus to
him and may well have planted a seed that developed during the following
years. There is no evidence in Wittgenstein’s earlier work that he was
at all aware of Brouwer’s ideas, and it may be that Ramsey’s reference
to him in his 1925 paper was the first he had heard of Brouwer. But
references to Brouwer do crop up from 1929 onwards – so much so, that
when Russell was called upon to report on Wittgenstein’s work in 1930 he
detected what he obviously considered to be an unhealthy influence:</p>
<p>… he has a lot of stuff about infinity, which is always in danger of
becoming what Brouwer has said, and has to be pulled up short whenever
this danger becomes apparent.</p>
<p>It is likely, however, that Wittgenstein’s excitement after the
lecture had as much to do with his disagreements with Brouwer as with
his agreement. There is much in the lecture that conflicts with
Wittgenstein’s own views, both in his early and in his later work. In
particular, the Kantian notion of a ‘basic mathematical intuition’,
which forms the philosophical foundation of intuitionism, was something
with which Wittgenstein never had any sympathy, at any time in his life.
In fact, if anything, his opposition to it strengthened as time went on,
until in his 1939 lectures on the foundations of mathematics he told his
audience bluntly: ’Intuitionism is all bosh – entirely.’31</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are in Brouwer’s outlook certain elements that
would have chimed with Wittgenstein’s own, especially in his
disagreements with the view propounded by Russell and Ramsey. These go
deeper than the particular point noted by Russell – that Wittgenstein
appeared to accept Brouwer’s rejection of the notion of an infinite
series in extension – and constitute a philosophical attitude that is
fundamentally at variance with the ‘bourgeois’ mentality of Russell and
Ramsey. On a general level one could say that Brouwer’s philosophical
position belongs to the tradition of continental anti-rationalist
thought which one associates, for example, with Schopenhauer, and for
which Wittgenstein – as Carnap discovered to his surprise – had a great
deal of sympathy. (During this period Wittgenstein surprised Carnap by
defending Schopenhauer against the criticism of Schlick.) The Vienna
Circle, like Russell and Ramsey, placed themselves in a position that
would have nothing to do with this anti-rationalist tradition.</p>
<p>More particularly, there are elements in Brouwer’s disagreements with
Russell’s logicism that would have struck a sympathetic chord in
Wittgenstein. Brouwer rejected the idea that mathematics either could or
needed to be grounded in logic. He further rejected the notion that
consistency proofs were essential in mathematics. He also rejected the
‘objectivity’ of mathematics in the sense that it is usually understood
– i.e. for Brouwer, there is no mind-independent mathematical reality
about which mathematicians make discoveries. The mathematician, on
Brouwer’s view, is not a discoverer but a creator: mathematics is not a
body of facts but a construction of the human mind.</p>
<p>With all these points Wittgenstein was in agreement, and his later
work can be seen as a development of these thoughts into an area that
took him far away from the logical atomism of the Tractatus. If this
development brought him no nearer to intuitionism, it perhaps helped to
crystallize his many disagreements, in general and in detail, with the
logicist approach to mathematics propounded by Russell and Ramsey – an
approach which had guided, even if it had not dictated, the view he had
expounded in the Tractatus.</p>
<p>Brouwer’s lecture may not have persuaded Wittgenstein that the
Tractatus was mistaken, but it may have convinced him that his book was
not, after all, the final word on the subject. There might, indeed, be
more to be said.</p>
<p>Thus, in the autumn of 1928, when the house was finished and his
thoughts turned once more to visiting England, he could, after all,
contemplate returning to philosophical work. Not that such an intention
is evident from the letters he wrote Keynes. In November he sent Keynes
photographs of the house – ‘à la Corbusier’, as Keynes inaccurately
described it in a letter to his wife, Lydia Lopokova – and announced his
desire to visit England in December, implying a short, holiday, visit.32
He ‘wants to stay with me here in about a fortnight’, Keynes wrote. ‘Am
I strong enough? Perhaps if I do not work between now and then, I shall
be.’</p>
<p>In the event, illness kept Wittgenstein in Vienna throughout
December, and when, at the beginning of January, he was finally able to
come to England, it was (as Keynes discovered with no apparent great
surprise) not to enjoy a holiday in Lewes, nor to look for work sweeping
the streets, but to return to Cambridge and work with Ramsey on
philosophy.</p>
