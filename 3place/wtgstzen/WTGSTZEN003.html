<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>THE FIGURE OF Ludwig Wittgenstein exerts a very special fascination
that is not wholly explained by the enormous influence he has had on the
development of philosophy this century. Even those quite unconcerned
with analytical philosophy find him compelling. Poems have been written
about him, paintings inspired by him, his work has been set to music,
and he has been made the central character in a successful novel that is
little more than a fictionalized biography (The World as I Found It, by
Bruce Duffy). In addition, there have been at least five television
programmes made about him and countless memoirs of him written, often by
people who knew him only very slightly. (F. R. Leavis, for example, who
met him on perhaps four or five occasions, has made his ‘Memories of
Wittgenstein’ the subject of a sixteen-page article.) Recollections of
Wittgenstein have been published by the lady who taught him Russian, the
man who delivered peat to his cottage in Ireland and the man who, though
he did not know him very well, happened to take the last photographs of
him.</p>
<p>All this is, in a way, quite separate from the ongoing industry of
producing commentaries on Wittgenstein’s philosophy. This industry too,
however, continues apace. A recent bibliography of secondary sources
lists no fewer than 5,868 articles and books about his work. Very few of
these would be of interest (or even intelligible) to anyone outside
academia, and equally few of them would concern themselves with the
aspects of Wittgenstein’s life and personality that have inspired the
work mentioned in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that interest in Wittgenstein, great though it is,
suffers from an unfortunate polarity between those who study his work in
isolation from his life and those who find his life fascinating but his
work unintelligible. It is a common experience, I think, for someone to
read, say, Norman Malcolm’s Memoir, to find themselves captivated by the
figure described therein, and then be inspired to read Wittgenstein’s
work for themselves, only to find that they cannot understand a word of
it. There are, it has to be said, many excellent introductory books on
Wittgenstein’s work that would explain what his main philosophical
themes are, and how he deals with them. What they do not explain is what
his work has to do with him – what the connections are between the
spiritual and ethical preoccupations that dominate his life, and the
seemingly rather remote philosophical questions that dominate his
work.</p>
<p>The aim of this book is to bridge that gap. By describing the life
and the work in the one narrative, I hope to make it clear how this work
came from this man, to show – what many who read Wittgenstein’s work
instinctively feel – the unity of his philosophical concerns with his
emotional and spiritual life.</p>
