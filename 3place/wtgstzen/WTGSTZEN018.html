<h4 id="francis">15 FRANCIS</h4>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN’S QUIXOTIC ASSAULT on the status of pure mathematics
reached a peak during the academic year of 1932–3. During this year he
gave two sets of lectures, one entitled ‘Philosophy’, and the other
‘Philosophy for Mathematicians’. In the second of these he attempted to
combat what he regarded as the baleful influence on undergraduate
mathematicians of the textbooks that were used to teach them. He would
read out extracts from Hardy’s Pure Mathematics (the standard university
text at that time) and use them to illustrate the philosophical fog that
he believed surrounded the whole discipline of pure mathematics – a fog
he thought could be dispelled only by uprooting the many commonly held
assumptions about mathematics that are so deeply embedded as to be very
rarely examined.</p>
<p>The first of these is that mathematics stands upon the logical
foundations given to it by Cantor, Frege and Russell, among others. He
began his lectures with a straightforward statement of his position on
this question. ‘Is there a substratum on which mathematics rests?’ he
asked rhetorically:1</p>
<p>Is logic the foundation of mathematics? In my view mathematical logic
is simply part of mathematics. Russell’s calculus is not fundamental; it
is just another calculus. There is nothing wrong with a science before
the foundations are laid.</p>
<p>Another of these assumptions is the idea that mathematics is
concerned with the discovery of facts that are in some way objectively
true (about something or other). What they are true of, and in what this
objectivity consists, has, of course, been the subject-matter of the
philosophy of mathematics since the time of Plato, and philosophers have
traditionally been divided between those who say that mathematical
statements are true about the physical world (empiricists) and those
who, feeling this view does not do justice to the inexorability of
mathematics, claim that they are true of the mathematical world –
Plato’s eternal world of ideas or forms (hence, Platonists). To this
division Kant added a third view, which is that mathematical statements
are true of the ‘form of our intuition’, and this was roughly the view
of Brouwer and the intuitionist school. But, for Wittgenstein, the whole
idea that mathematics is concerned with the discovery of truths is a
mistake that has arisen with the growth of pure mathematics and the
separation of mathematics from physical science (the unused broom being
mistaken for part of the furniture). If, says Wittgenstein, we looked on
mathematics as a series of techniques (for calculating, measuring etc.),
then the question of what it was about simply would not arise.</p>
<p>The view of mathematics that Wittgenstein is attacking is stated very
succinctly in a lecture given by Hardy, which was published in Mind in
1929 under the title ‘Mathematical Proof’. Hardy – who appears to have
regarded his excursion into philosophy as a kind of light relief from
the serious business of his work as a mathematician – states
unequivocably:</p>
<p>… no philosophy can possibly be sympathetic to a mathematician which
does not admit, in one manner or another, the immutable and
unconditional validity of mathematical truth.2 Mathematical theorems are
true or false; their truth or falsity is absolute and independent of our
knowledge of them. In some sense, mathematical truth is part of
objective reality … [mathematical propositions] are in one sense or
another, however elusive and sophisticated that sense may be, theorems
concerning reality … They are not creations of our minds.</p>
<p>Both the tone and the content of this lecture infuriated
Wittgenstein. He told his class:</p>
<p>The talk of mathematicians becomes absurd when they leave
mathematics, for example, Hardy’s description of mathematics as not
being a creation of our minds.3 He conceived philosophy as a decoration,
an atmosphere, around the hard realities of mathematics and science.
These disciplines, on the one hand, and philosophy on the other, are
thought of as being like the necessities and decoration of a room. Hardy
is thinking of philosophical opinions. I conceive of philosophy as an
activity of clearing up thought.</p>
<p>In relation to mathematics, Wittgenstein had, at this time, a fairly
clear idea of the way in which he wanted to present this activity of
clarification; it was in the presentation of his more general
philosophical position that he was still feeling his way towards a
satisfactory formulation. Philosophy was, for him, like mathematics, a
series of techniques. But whereas the mathematical techniques already
existed, and his role consisted in persuading his audience to see them
as techniques (and not as true or false propositions), the philosophical
techniques he wished to advance were of his own creation, and were still
in their infancy.</p>
<p>In the series of lectures entitled ‘Philosophy’, Wittgenstein
introduced a technique that was to become increasingly central to his
philosophical method: the technique of inventing what he called
‘language-games’. This is the method of inventing imaginary situations
in which language is used for some tightly defined practical purpose. It
may be a few words or phrases from our own language or an entirely
fictitious language, but what is essential is that, in picturing the
situation, the language cannot be described without mentioning the use
to which it is put. The technique is a kind of therapy, the purpose of
which is to free ourselves from the philosophical confusions that result
from considering language in isolation from its place in the ‘stream of
life’.</p>
<p>As examples of the sort of thinking he was attempting to liberate his
audience from, Wittgenstein mentioned his own earlier work and that of
Russell. Both, he said, had been misled, by concentrating on one type of
language, the assertoric sentence, into trying to analyse the whole of
language as though it consisted of nothing but that type, or as though
the other uses of language could be analysed as variations on that basic
theme. Thus, they had arrived at an unworkable notion – the ‘atomic
proposition’:</p>
<p>Russell and I both expected to find the first elements, or
‘individuals’, and thus the possible atomic propositions, by logical
analysis … And we were both at fault for giving no examples of atomic
propositions or of individuals.4 We both in different ways pushed the
question of examples aside. We should not have said ‘We can’t give them
because analysis has not gone far enough, but we’ll get there in
time.’</p>
<p>He and Russell had had too rigid a notion of proposition, and the
purpose of the language-game method was, so to speak, to loosen such
notions. For example, he asked his audience to consider the
language-game of teaching a child language by pointing to things and
pronouncing the words for them. Where in this game, he asked, does the
use of a proposition start? If we say to a child: ‘Book’, and he brings
us a book, has he learnt a proposition? Or has he learnt propositions
only when there is a question of truth and falsity? But then, still, one
word – for example, the word: ‘Six’ in answer to the question: ‘How many
chairs?’ – might be true or false. And is it, therefore, a proposition?
It does not matter, Wittgenstein implies, how we answer these questions;
what matters is that we see how arbitrary any answers to them would be,
and thus how ‘fluid’ our concepts are – too fluid to be forced into the
kind of analysis once advocated by Russell and himself:</p>
<p>I have wanted to show by means of language-games the vague way in
which we use ‘language’, ‘proposition’, ‘sentence’.5 There are many
things, such as orders, which we may or may not call propositions and
not only one game can be called language. Language-games are a clue to
the understanding of logic. Since what we call a proposition is more or
less arbitrary, what we call logic plays a different role from that
which Russell and Frege supposed.</p>
<p>Among those attending these lectures was a twenty-year-old
undergraduate student of mathematics, then in his third year at Trinity,
who was soon to become the most important person in Wittgenstein’s life
– his constant companion, his trusted confidant, and, even, his most
valued collaborator in philosophical work.</p>
<p>Francis Skinner had come up to Cambridge from St Paul’s in 1930, and
was recognized as one of the most promising mathematicians of his year.
By his second year at Cambridge, however, his mathematical work had
begun to take second place to his interest in Wittgenstein. He became
utterly, uncritically and almost obsessively devoted to Wittgenstein.
What it was about him that attracted Wittgenstein, we can only guess. He
is remembered by all who knew him as shy, unassuming, good-looking and,
above all, extraordinarily gentle. But attracted Wittgenstein certainly
was. As with Pinsent and Marguerite, Skinner’s mere presence seemed to
provide Wittgenstein with the peace he needed to conduct his work. In
1932 Wittgenstein left a note concerning the work he was then
endeavouring to finish which suggests that he himself regarded Skinner’s
relation to that work as parallel to Pinsent’s to the Tractatus:</p>
<p>In the event of my death before the completion or publication of this
book my notes should be published as fragments under the title
‘Philosophical Remarks’ and with the dedication: ‘To Francis
Skinner’.6</p>
<p>Skinner’s letters were kept by Wittgenstein, and were found among his
possessions after his death, and from them we can reconstruct something
of how the relationship developed. (Wittgenstein’s letters to Skinner
were retrieved by Wittgenstein after Skinner’s death and were,
presumably, burnt.) The first letter to survive is dated 26 December
1932, and is written to thank Wittgenstein for a Christmas tree he had
given. Two days later Skinner writes: ‘I am glad to read that you think
about me.7 I think about you a lot.’</p>
<p>But it was not until the Easter break of 1933 that they became
‘Francis’ and ‘Ludwig’ to each other, and that Skinner began to express
himself in terms that suggest he was writing – albeit nervously and
self-consciously – to a beloved. On 25 March, while on holiday in
Guernsey, he wrote:</p>
<p>Dear Ludwig,8</p>
<p>I have thought about you a lot since we left last Saturday. I hope I
think about you in the right way. When we were talking about the case
which your sister gave you, I smiled several times, and you said you
could see it wasn’t a kind smile. Sometimes when I am thinking about
you, I have smiled in the same sort of way. I always knew it was wrong
to smile, because immediately afterwards I tried to put it out of my
mind, but I didn’t know how unkind it was.</p>
<p>… I am staying for a few days on an island in the Channel, where some
of the people speak French. I remember when I once asked if you could
speak French, you told me you were taught when you were young by a lady
who stayed in your house who was very nice indeed. When I thought about
this this morning, I hoped that you would be pleased if you knew how
much I enjoyed remembering things like this you have told me.</p>
<p>Francis</p>
<p>We must assume that Wittgenstein found the childlike simplicity – one
might almost say simple-mindedness – revealed in this letter endearing.
Certainly Skinner’s letters show nothing of the ‘cleverness’ that
Wittgenstein so disliked in many of the students and dons at Cambridge.
He was not the type to be overheard saying ‘Oh, really!’ Neither do his
letters show any trace of egotism. In his devotion to Wittgenstein
(which he maintained for the rest of his tragically short life), Skinner
surrendered his own will almost entirely. Everything else took second
place. His sister has recalled that when she and her mother came to
Trinity to meet Francis, they would be met by him rushing down the
stairs and hushing them with: ‘I’m busy. I’ve got Dr Wittgenstein here.9
We’re working. Come back later.’</p>
<p>Skinner is the most perfect example of the childlike innocence and
first-class brains that Fania Pascal has described as the prerequisites
of Wittgensteinian disciplehood. He came from a family steeped in the
value of academic achievement. His father was a physicist at Chelsea
Polytechnic, and his two elder sisters had both been at Cambridge before
him, the first to study classics, the second, mathematics. It was
expected – indeed, regarded as inevitable – that Francis would pursue an
academic career. Had it not been for Wittgenstein’s intervention, he
would almost certainly have done so.</p>
<p>So complete was Skinner’s absorption in Wittgenstein during his final
year as an undergraduate that when, in the summer of 1933, he graduated
with a first-class degree in mathematics and was awarded a postgraduate
scholarship, his family had the impression that this was to allow him to
continue working with Wittgenstein. In fact, the award was given by
Trinity with the intention that he should use it to pursue mathematical
research.</p>
<p>It had by this time become difficult for Skinner to endure the long
summer vacations that Wittgenstein spent away from Cambridge. At the end
of the summer he wrote: ‘I feel much further away from you, and am
longing to be nearer you again.’ He sent Wittgenstein a series of
picture postcards depicting scenes of his home town of Letchworth in
Hertfordshire.10 On the front of the cards he scribbled remarks which
were ostensibly designed to explain a little about the town, but which
in fact are much more revealing of Skinner’s own frame of mind, showing
that, with Wittgenstein hundreds of miles away, Letchworth was the very
last place on earth he wished to be.</p>
<p>On a card showing Howard Corner, he explained that the ‘Garden City’
of Letchworth had been founded by Sir Ebenezer Howard, who had wanted
everyone to have the chance of living in the country. ‘The result’, he
wrote, ‘is something incredibly depressing and bloody (for me, at any
rate).’ On a card showing the Broadway: ‘This is the road to the town
andandandand station. There is a row of houses one side. They always
make me feel very miserable.’ On a photograph of the Spirella Works:
‘This is the largest factory in Letchworth … the garden looks to me
quite uninteresting and dead always.’ The last two cards show Leys
Avenue – ‘a very dull and depressing street. All the people are
disagreeably dressed and have such mean expressions on their faces’ –
and East Cheap – ‘an absurd name … When I’m in these streets I feel
surrounded by gossip.’</p>
<p>His relationship with Wittgenstein was to provide him with some sort
of escape from this ‘dead’ and ‘dull’ existence, and eventually – much
to the consternation of his family – a release from their expectations.
It was also to provide him with a new set of expectations, to which he
zealously conformed. For the three years of his postgraduate scholarship
he worked assiduously with Wittgenstein on the preparation of his work
for publication, and when the time came he abandoned academic life
altogether for a job that Wittgenstein considered more suitable for
him.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s advice to his friends and students to leave academia
was based on his conviction that its atmosphere was too rarefied to
sustain proper life. There is no oxygen in Cambridge, he told Drury. It
didn’t matter for him – he manufactured his own. But for people
dependent on the air around them, it was important to get away, into a
healthier environment. His ideal was a job in the medical profession. He
had already nudged Marguerite in this direction, and she was at this
time training to become a nurse in Berne, a project in which
Wittgenstein took a great personal interest. Their relationship had lost
any trace of romantic involvement, and Marguerite had fallen in love
with Talle Sjögren, but Wittgenstein would still occasionally travel to
Berne to see how Marguerite was getting on in her training.</p>
<p>Now, in the summer of 1933, after the completion of his project
working with unemployed miners in South Wales, Drury decided he, too,
wanted to train as a nurse. He was told, however, that with his
education he would be more useful if he trained as a doctor. Upon being
told of this, Wittgenstein immediately took the matter into his own
hands. He arranged for Keynes and Gilbert Pattisson to lend Drury the
necessary funds, and sent a telegram to Drury urging him: ‘Come to
Cambridge at once.’ Drury was hardly out of the train before
Wittgenstein announced: ’Now there is to be no more argument about this:
it has all been settled already, you are to start work as a medical
student at once.’11 He was later to say that, of all his students, it
was in his influence on Drury’s career that he could take most pride and
satisfaction.</p>
<p>On more than one occasion Wittgenstein himself thought seriously of
training to be a doctor, and of escaping the ‘deadness’ of academic
philosophy. He might be able to generate oxygen – but what was the point
of providing lungs for a corpse? He knew, of course, that a great many
philosophers wanted to know his latest thoughts, for by 1933 it was
widely known, particularly in Cambridge and Vienna, that he had
radically changed his position since the publication of the Tractatus.
He resolutely refused to accept that it was for them – for the
‘philosophic journalists’ – that he was preparing his new work, but
still he could not bear to see his oxygen being recycled by them. In
March 1933, he had been pained to see an article by Richard Braithwaite
in a collection entitled Cambridge University Studies, in which
Braithwaite outlined the impression that various philosophers, including
Wittgenstein, had made upon him. The fact that Braithwaite might have
been regarded as presenting Wittgenstein’s present views prompted
Wittgenstein to write a letter to Mind disclaiming all responsibility
for the views that had been attributed to him: ‘Part of [Braithwaite’s]
statements can be taken to be inaccurate representations of my views’,
he wrote; ’others again clearly contradict them.’12 He ended:</p>
<p>That which is retarding the publication of my work, the difficulty of
presenting it in a clear and coherent form, a fortiori prevents me from
stating my views within the space of a letter. So the reader must
suspend his judgement about them.</p>
<p>The same edition of Mind carries a contrite apology from Braithwaite,
which ends, however, with a sting in its tail: ’The extent to which I
have misrepresented Dr Wittgenstein cannot be judged until the
appearance of the book which we are all eagerly awaiting.’13</p>
