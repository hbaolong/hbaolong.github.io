<h4 id="norway">5 NORWAY</h4>
<p>AS MIGHT BE expected, Russell thought Wittgenstein’s plan to live
alone in Norway for two years a wild and lunatic one. He tried to talk
him out of it by presenting various objections, all of which were
brushed aside:</p>
<p>I said it would be dark, andandandand he said he hated daylight.1 I
said it would be lonely, andandandand he said he prostituted his mind
talking to intelligent people. I said he was mad andandandand he said
God preserve him from sanity. (God certainly will.)</p>
<p>Before Wittgenstein embarked again for Bergen, it was important for
both him and Russell that a written record of his work should be made:
for Wittgenstein, because of his conviction that he had only a few more
years (or even months) to live; and for Russell, because he hoped to use
Wittgenstein’s ideas for his forthcoming series of lectures in America –
and because he, too, thought it was now or never (he strongly suspected
that Wittgenstein would go completely mad and/ or commit suicide during
his solitary sojourn in Norway).</p>
<p>The difficulty was that Wittgenstein’s ‘artistic conscience’ (as
Russell called it) made him extremely reluctant to write his ideas out
in an imperfect form, and – as he had not yet reached a perfect
formulation of them – therefore loathe to write anything at all. He
wanted simply to explain his ideas to Russell, orally. Russell, who
considered Wittgenstein’s work ‘as good as anything that has ever been
done on logic’, did his best to follow Wittgenstein’s explanations, but
in the end, finding the ideas so subtle that he kept forgetting them,
begged him to write them out:</p>
<p>After much groaning he said he couldn’t.2 I abused him roundly and we
had a fine row. Then he said he wd. talk andandandand write down any of
his remarks that I thought worth it, so we did that, andandandand it
answered fairly well. But we both got utterly exhausted, andandandand it
was slow.</p>
<p>He was prevented from giving up only by his resolute determination to
‘drag W’s thoughts out of him with pincers, however he may scream with
the pain’.</p>
<p>Eventually he managed to get some written record of Wittgenstein’s
thoughts by asking the secretary of Philip Jourdain (who had come into
Russell’s room to borrow a book) to take shorthand notes while
Wittgenstein talked and Russell asked questions. These notes were
supplemented by a typescript which Wittgenstein dictated a few days
later while he was in Birmingham saying his goodbyes to Pinsent.
Together, the dictation and typescript constitute Notes on Logic –
Wittgenstein’s first philosophical work.</p>
<p>The work might be seen as an expansion of his remark to Russell
earlier in the summer, that the Theory of Types ‘must be rendered
superfluous by a proper theory of symbolism’, and as a preliminary
attempt to provide such a theory. In its details, and in its criticisms
of Russell, it is indeed very subtle. But its fundamental thought is
quite staggeringly simple. It is that: ‘“A” is the same letter as “A”’
(a remark which prompted the shorthand writer to comment, ‘Well, that’s
true anyway’). This apparently trivial truism was to lead to the
distinction between showing and saying which lies at the heart of the
Tractatus. The thought – here in an embryonic form – is that what the
Theory of Types says cannot be said, and must be shown by the symbolism
(by our seeing that ‘A’ is the same letter as ‘A’, the same type of
letter as ‘B’, and a different type from ‘x’, ‘y’ and ‘z’).</p>
<p>In addition to this embryonic Theory of Symbolism, Notes on Logic
contains a series of remarks on philosophy which state unequivocally
Wittgenstein’s conception of the subject, a conception that remained –
in most of these respects at least – unchanged for the rest of his
life:</p>
<p>In philosophy there are no deductions: it is purely descriptive.3</p>
<p>Philosophy gives no pictures of reality.</p>
<p>Philosophy can neither confirm nor confute scientific
investigation.</p>
<p>Philosophy consists of logic and metaphysics: logic is its basis.</p>
<p>Epistemology is the philosophy of psychology.</p>
<p>Distrust of grammar is the first requisite for philosophizing.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to Pinsent, Wittgenstein left Birmingham on 8
October. ‘It was sad parting from him’, wrote Pinsent:4</p>
<p>… but it is possible he may pay a short visit to England next summer
(remaining in Norway till then andandandand going back thither
afterwards) when I may see him again. Our acquaintance has been chaotic
but I have been very thankful for it: I am sure he has also.</p>
<p>The outbreak of war the following summer meant that this was the last
time the two saw each other.</p>
<p>What Wittgenstein needed (or felt he needed) in 1913 was solitude. He
found the ideal place: a village called Skjolden, by the side of the
Sogne fjord, north of Bergen. There he lodged with the local postmaster,
Hans Klingenberg. ‘As I hardly meet a soul in this place’, he wrote to
Russell, ‘the progress of my Norwegian is exceedingly slow.’5 Neither
statement is entirely true. In fact, he made friends with a number of
the villagers. As well as the Klingenbergs, there was Halvard Draegni,
the owner of a local crate-factory, Anna Rebni, a farmer, and Arne
Bolstad, then a thirteen-year-old schoolboy. And his progress in
Norwegian was so swift that within a year he was able to exchange
letters with these friends in their native language. Admittedly, the
language in these letters was not excessively complicated or
sophisticated. But this was due less to the limitations of his Norwegian
than to the nature of the friendships. They were, in fact, the kind of
simple, direct and brief letters he liked best: ‘Dear Ludwig, how are
you? We often think of you’ might be a typical example.</p>
<p>He was not, then, entirely divorced from human contact. But he was –
and perhaps this is most important – away from society, free from the
kind of obligations and expectations imposed by bourgeois life, whether
that of Cambridge or that of Vienna. His horror of the bourgeois life
was based in part on the superficial nature of the relationships it
imposed on people, but partly also on the fact that his own nature
imposed upon him an almost insufferable conflict when faced with it –
the conflict between needing to withstand it, and needing to conform to
it.</p>
<p>In Skjolden he could be free from such conflicts; he could be himself
without the strain of upsetting or offending people. It was a tremendous
liberation. He could devote himself entirely to himself – or, rather, to
what he felt to be practically the same thing, to his logic. That, and
the beauty of the countryside – ideal for the long, solitary walks he
needed as both a relaxation and a meditation – produced in him a kind of
euphoria. Together they created the perfect conditions in which to
think. It was perhaps the only time in his life when he had no doubts
that he was in the right place, doing the right thing, and the year he
spent in Skjolden was possibly the most productive of his life. Years
later he used to look back on it as the one time that he had had some
thoughts that were entirely his own, when he had even ‘brought to life
new movements in thinking’. ‘Then my mind was on fire!’ he used to
say.6</p>
<p>Within just a few weeks he was able to write to Russell with an
announcement of important new ideas, the apparently startling
consequence of which would be ’that the whole of Logic follows from one
P.P. [primitive proposition] only!!’7</p>
<p>Russell, meanwhile, was doing his utmost to digest the Notes on Logic
in readiness for his Harvard lectures. In the preface to the published
version of those lectures, he states:</p>
<p>In pure logic, which, however, will be very briefly discussed in
these lectures, I have had the benefit of vitally important discoveries,
not yet published, by my friend Mr Ludwig Wittgenstein.8</p>
<p>But there were points about which he was still unclear, and he sent
Wittgenstein a series of questions hoping for elucidation.
Wittgenstein’s answers were brief and, for the most part, helpful. But
he was too full of new ideas to find the process of going over old
ground congenial: ’An account of general indefinables? Oh Lord! It is
too boring!!! Some other time!’9</p>
<p>Honestly – I will write to you about it some time, if by that time
you have not found out all about it. (Because it is all quite clear in
the manuscript, I think.) But just now I am SO troubled with Identity
that I really cannot write any long jaw. All sorts of new logical stuff
seems to be growing in me, but I can’t yet write about it.</p>
<p>In the excitement of this peak of intellectual creativity he found it
particularly irksome to give explanations of points he felt were already
clear and well established. In a letter of November he tried to explain
why he thought the whole of logic had to follow from a single primitive
proposition. But when Russell still did not get it, his patience was
exhausted:</p>
<p>I beg you to think about these matters for yourself, it is
INTOLERABLE for me, to repeat a written explanation which even the first
time I gave only with the utmost repugnance.10</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he did make an effort to clarify the point. It hinged
on his conviction that, given the correct method of displaying the truth
possibilities of a proposition, a logical proposition can be shown to be
either true or false without knowing the truth or falsity of its
constituent parts. Thus: ‘It is either raining or not raining’ will be
true whether ‘It is raining’ is true or false. Similarly, we need know
nothing about the weather to know that the statement: ‘It is both
raining and not raining’ is certainly false. Such statements are logical
propositions: the first is a tautology (which is always true), and the
second a contradiction (always false). Now, if we had a method for
determining whether or not any given proposition is a tautology, a
contradiction or neither, then we would have a single rule for
determining all the propositions of logic. Express this rule in a
proposition, and the whole of logic has been shown to follow from a
single (primitive) proposition.</p>
<p>This argument works only if we accept that all true logical
propositions are tautologies. That is why Wittgenstein begins his letter
to Russell with the following oracular pronouncement:</p>
<p>All the propositions of logic are generalizations of tautologies and
all generalizations of tautologies are propositions of logic.11 There
are no other logical propositions. (I regard this as definitive.)</p>
<p>‘The big question now’, he told Russell, is: ‘how must a system of
signs be constituted in order to make every tautology recognizable as
such IN ONE AND THE SAME WAY? This is the fundamental problem of
logic!’</p>
<p>He was later to tackle this problem using the so-called Truth-Table
Method (familiar to all present-day undergraduate students of logic).
But, for the moment, the peak of the crescendo had passed. As Christmas
approached, exhilaration gave way to gloom and Wittgenstein returned to
the morbid conviction that he had not long to live, and that he would
therefore never publish anything in his lifetime. ‘After my death’, he
insisted to Russell, ‘you must see to the printing of the volume of my
journal with the whole story in it.’</p>
<p>The letter ends: ‘I often think I am going mad.’ The insanity was
two-edged, the mania of the previous few months turning into depression
as Christmas approached. For, at Christmas: ‘I must UNFORTUNATELY go to
Vienna.’ There was no way out of it:</p>
<p>The fact is, my mother very much wants me to, so much so that she
would be grievously offended if I did not come; and she has such bad
memories of just this time last year that I have not the heart to stay
away.</p>
<p>And yet: ‘the thought of going home appals me’. The one consolation
was that his visit would be brief and he would be back in Skjolden
before long: ‘Being alone here does me no end of good and I do not think
I could now bear life among people.’</p>
<p>The week before he left, he wrote: ‘My day passes between logic,
whistling, going for walks, and being depressed’:12</p>
<p>I wish to God that I were more intelligent and everything would
finally become clear to me – or else that I needn’t live much
longer!</p>
<p>Complete clarity, or death – there was no middle way. If he could not
solve: ‘the question [that] is fundamental to the whole of logic’, he
had no right – or, at any rate, no desire – to live. There was to be no
compromise.</p>
<p>In agreeing to join his family for Christmas, Wittgenstein was
compromising – going against his own impulses – in order to satisfy the
duty he felt to his mother. Once there, further compromise would be
inevitable. The energy he had successfully channelled into his logic
would have once more to be dissipated in the strain of personal
relationships. His real preoccupations would have to be driven
underground, while, for the sake of his mother and the rest of his
family, he adopted the persona of the dutiful son. And, worst of all, he
did not have the strength or clarity of purpose to do anything
different: he could not bring himself to do anything that would risk
grievously offending his mother. The experience threw him into a state
of paralysing confusion. He was forced to realize that, however close he
might be to complete, uncompromising clarity in the field of logic, he
was as far away from it as ever in his personal life – in himself. He
alternated between resistance and resignation, between ferment and
apathy. ‘But’, he told Russell:</p>
<p>… deep inside me there’s a perpetual seething, like the bottom of a
geyser, and I keep hoping that things will come to an eruption once and
for all, so that I can turn into a different person.13</p>
<p>In this state he was, of course, unable to do any work on logic. But,
in his torment, was he not squaring up to an equally important, even
related, set of problems? ‘Logic and ethics’, Weininger had written,
‘are fundamentally the same, they are no more than duty to oneself.’ It
was a view Wittgenstein echoed in his letter to Russell, who, as
Wittgenstein knew from their discussions in Cambridge, was hardly likely
to see it in the same light:</p>
<p>Perhaps you regard this thinking about myself as a waste of time –
but how can I be a logician before I’m a human being! Far the most
important thing is to settle accounts with myself!</p>
<p>Like his logic, this work on himself could best be done in solitude,
and he returned to Norway as soon as possible. ‘It’s VERY sad’, he wrote
to Russell, ‘but I’ve once again no logical news for you’:14</p>
<p>The reason is that things have gone terribly badly for me in the last
weeks. (A result of my ‘holidays’ in Vienna.) Every day I was tormented
by a frightful Angst and by depression in turns and even in the
intervals I was so exhausted that I wasn’t able to think of doing a bit
of work. It’s terrifying beyond all description the kinds of mental
torment that there can be! It wasn’t until two days ago that I could
hear the voice of reason over the howls of the damned and I began to
work again. And perhaps I’ll get better now and be able to produce
something decent. But I never knew what it meant to feel only one step
away from madness. – Let’s hope for the best!</p>
<p>He had returned with a determination to rid himself once and for all
of the sordid compromises in his life. And – though it was a bit like
kicking the dog to get even with the boss – he began with his
relationship with Russell. The opening salvo was mild enough – a gentle,
and disguised, ticking off about Russell’s own tendency to
compromise:</p>
<p>All best wishes for your lecture-course in America! Perhaps it will
give you at any rate a more favourable opportunity than usual to tell
them your thoughts and not just cut and dried results. THAT is what
would be of the greatest imaginable value for your audience – to get to
know the value of thought and not that of a cut and dried result.</p>
<p>This can hardly have prepared Russell for what was to follow. He
replied, as he told Ottoline, in ‘too sharp’ a manner. What he actually
said, we do not know, though it is a reasonable conjecture that he
showed some impatience with Wittgenstein’s pointed remarks about his
forthcoming lectures, that he criticized Wittgenstein’s perfectionism
(as he had done in the past), and that he justified his own willingness
to publish imperfect work.</p>
<p>Whatever it was, it was sufficient – in Wittgenstein’s present mood –
to convince him that the time had come to break off all relations with
Russell. In what was clearly intended to be the last letter he ever
wrote to Russell, he explained that he had thought a lot about their
relationship, and had ‘come to the conclusion that we really don’t suit
one another’:15</p>
<p>This is NOT MEANT AS A REPROACH! either for you or for me. But it is
a fact. We’ve often had uncomfortable conversations with one another
when certain subjects came up. And the uncomfortableness was not a
consequence of ill humour on one side or the other but of enormous
differences in our natures. I beg you most earnestly not to think I want
to reproach you in any way or to preach you a sermon. I only want to put
our relationship in clear terms in order to draw a conclusion. – Our
latest quarrel, too, was certainly not simply a result of your
sensitiveness or my inconsiderateness. It came from deeper – from the
fact that my letter must have shown you how totally different our ideas
are, E.G. of the value of a scientific work. It was, of course, stupid
of me to have written to you at such length about this matter: I ought
to have told myself that such fundamental differences cannot be resolved
by a letter. And this is just ONE instance out of many.</p>
<p>Russell’s value-judgements, he conceded, were just as good and as
deep-seated as his own, but – for that very reason – there could not be
any real relation of friendship between them:</p>
<p>I shall be grateful to you and devoted to you WITH ALL MY HEART for
the whole of my life, but I shall not write to you again and you will
not see me again either. Now that I am once again reconciled with you I
want to part from you in peace so that we shan’t sometime get annoyed
with one another again and then perhaps part as enemies. I wish you
everything of the best and I beg you not to forget me and to think of me
often with friendly feelings. Goodbye!</p>
<p>Yours ever</p>
<p>LUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN</p>
<p>‘I dare say his mood will change after a while’, Russell told
Ottoline after showing her the letter; ‘I find I don’t care on his
account, but only for the sake of logic.’16 And yet: ‘I do really care
too much to look at it. It is my fault – I have been too sharp with
him.’</p>
<p>He managed to reply in a way that melted Wittgenstein’s resolve never
to write to him again. On 3 March Wittgenstein wrote saying Russell’s
letter had been: ‘so full of kindness and friendship that I don’t think
I have the right to leave it unanswered’.17 Wittgenstein remained,
however, resolute on the central point: ‘our quarrels don’t arise just
from external reasons such as nervousness or over-tiredness but are – at
any rate on my side – very deep-rooted’:</p>
<p>You may be right in saying that we ourselves are not so very
different, but our ideals could not be more so. And that’s why we
haven’t been able and we shan’t ever be able to talk about anything
involving our value-judgements without either becoming hypocritical or
falling out. I think this is incontestable; I had noticed it a long time
ago; and it was frightful for me, because it tainted our relations with
one another; we seemed to be side by side in a marsh.</p>
<p>If they were to continue with any sort of relationship at all, it
would have to be on a different basis, one in which, ‘each can be
completely frank without hurting the other’. And, as their ideals were
fundamentally irreconcilable, these would have to be excluded. They
could avoid hypocrisy or strife only by ‘restricting our relationship to
the communication of facts capable of being established objectively,
with perhaps also some mention of our friendly feelings for one
another’:</p>
<p>Now perhaps you’ll say, ‘Things have more or less worked, up to the
present. Why not go on in the same way?’ But I’m too tired of this
constant sordid compromise. My life has been one nasty mess so far – but
need that go on indefinitely?</p>
<p>He therefore presented a proposal that would, he thought, allow their
relationship to continue on a ‘more genuine basis’:</p>
<p>Let’s write to each other about our work, our health, and the like,
but let’s avoid in our communications any kind of value-judgement.</p>
<p>It was a plan to which he adhered for the remainder of his
correspondence with Russell. He continued to sign himself ‘your devoted
friend’; he wrote of his work and he described his health. But the
intimacy which had previously enabled them to talk of ‘music, morals and
a host of things besides logic’ was lost. And what intellectual sympathy
survived this break was to disappear entirely as a result of the changes
brought about in both of them by the First World War – changes that
emphasized and heightened the differences in their natures.</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein repeatedly emphasized in his letters, his friendship
with Russell had been strained by their differences for over a year –
despite Russell’s delusion that it was their similarity that caused the
trouble. Even their philosophical discussions had, long before
Wittgenstein left for Norway, lost their co-operative character. In
fact, during his last year at Cambridge he had not really discussed his
ideas with Russell at all; he had simply reported them – given him, as
it were, logical bulletins. As early as the previous November, when he
had written to Moore urging him to come to Norway to discuss his work,
he had expressed the view that there was no one at Cambridge with whom
this was possible – no one ‘who is not yet stale and is really
interested in the subject’:18</p>
<p>Even Russell – who is of course most extraordinarily fresh for his
age – is no more pliable for this purpose.</p>
<p>As his relationship with Russell was first severed, and then placed
on a less intimate footing, Wittgenstein’s overtures to Moore became
ever more insistent. Moore was dragging his feet somewhat about the
proposed visit, and was probably regretting ever having promised to
undertake it. But Wittgenstein’s demands would brook no refusal: ‘You
must come as soon as Term ends’, he wrote on 18 February:19</p>
<p>I am looking forward to your coming more than I can say! I am bored
to death with Logik and other things. But I hope I shan’t die before you
come for in that case we couldn’t discuss much.</p>
<p>‘Logik’ is probably a reference to a work which Wittgenstein was then
in the process of writing, and which he planned to show Moore with the
intention of its being submitted for the BA degree. In March he wrote:
’I think, now, that Logic must be very nearly done if it is not
already.’20 And although Moore, meanwhile, had come up with a new excuse
– he needed to stay at Cambridge to work on a paper – Wittgenstein would
have none of it:</p>
<p>Why on earth won’t you do your paper here? You shall have a
sittingroom with a splendid view ALL BY YOURSELF and I shall leave you
alone as much as you like (in fact the whole day, if necessary). On the
other hand we could see one another whenever both of us should like to.
And we could even talk over your business (which might be fun). Or do
you want so many books? You see – I’ve PLENTY to do myself, so I shan’t
disturb you a bit. Do take the Boat that leaves Newcastle on the 17th
arriving in Bergen on the 19th and do your work here (I might even have
a good influence upon it by preventing too many repetitions).</p>
<p>Finally, Moore overcame his reluctance to face the rigours of the
journey – and the even more daunting prospect of being alone with
Wittgenstein – and agreed to come. He left for Bergen on 24 March and
was met there by Wittgenstein two days later. His visit lasted a
fortnight, every evening of which was taken up with ‘discussions’, which
consisted of Wittgenstein talking and Moore listening (‘he discusses’,
Moore complained in his diary).</p>
<p>On 1 April Wittgenstein began to dictate to Moore a series of notes
on logic. Whether these constitute the whole of the work referred to
above as ‘Logik’, or simply a selection, we can at least assume they
contain the most important parts of it. Their central point is the
emphatic insistence on the distinction between saying and showing, which
was only implicit in the notes dictated to Russell the previous year.
The notes begin:</p>
<p>Logical so-called propositions show the logical properties of
language and therefore of the Universe, but say nothing.21</p>
<p>The notes outline how this distinction allows us to achieve what he
had earlier told Russell must be achieved: a Theory of Symbolism which
shows the Theory of Types to be superfluous. That there are different
types of things (objects, facts, relations etc.) cannot be said, but is
shown by there being different types of symbols, the difference being
one which can immediately be seen.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein regarded the work as a considerable advance on the notes
he had earlier dictated to Russell, and it was, for the moment at least,
his last word on the subject. He wrote to Russell urging him to read
Moore’s notes. ‘I have now relapsed into a state of exhaustion and can
neither do any work nor explain what I did earlier’:22</p>
<p>However, I explained it in detail to Moore when he was with me and he
made various notes. So you can best find it all out from him. Many
things in it are new. – The best way to understand it all would be if
you read Moore’s notes for yourself. It will probably be some time
before I produce anything further.</p>
<p>On his return to Cambridge, Moore – as he had been instructed by
Wittgenstein – made enquiries as to whether ‘Logik’ might serve as a BA
thesis. In this, he sought the advice of W. M. Fletcher (Wittgenstein’s
tutor at Trinity), and was told that, according to the regulations
governing such theses, Wittgenstein’s work would not be eligible as it
stood. It was required that the dissertation should contain a preface
and notes indicating the sources from which information had been derived
and specifying which parts of the dissertation were claimed to be
original and which parts were based on the work of others.</p>
<p>Moore, accordingly, wrote to Wittgenstein to explain the situation.
Wittgenstein was outraged. His work – ‘the next big advance in
philosophy’ – not entitled to receive a BA!? And just because it was not
surrounded with the usual paraphernalia of undergraduate scholarship!
This was the limit. It was bad enough to have to offer pearls to swine;
to have them rejected was intolerable. On 7 May he gave vent to his
feelings in a fiercely sarcastic letter to Moore, which, for the time
being, put an end both to his friendship with Moore and to his hopes of
obtaining a Cambridge degree:</p>
<p>Dear Moore,</p>
<p>Your letter annoyed me.23 When I wrote Logik I didn’t consult the
Regulations, and therefore I think it would only be fair if you gave me
my degree without consulting them so much either! As to a Preface and
Notes; I think my examiners will easily see how much I have cribbed from
Bosanquet. – If I am not worth your making an exception for me even in
some STUPID details then I may as well go to HELL directly; and if I am
worth it and you don’t do it then – by God – you might go there.</p>
<p>The whole business is too stupid and too beastly to go on writing
about it so –</p>
<p>L.W.</p>
<p>The attack on Moore was unjustifiable: he had not made the
regulations, nor was it his job to enforce them – he was simply letting
Wittgenstein know where he stood with regard to them. He was, moreover,
not used to being addressed in such a manner, and was profoundly
disturbed by the tone of the letter. The unjustness shocked him deeply,
and the fierceness of it made him feel physically sick. His diary for
11–15 May shows him to be still reeling from the blow days after
receiving it. He did not reply.</p>
<p>Nor did he reply when, nearly two months later, on 3 July, he
received a somewhat friendlier, almost contrite letter, written after
Wittgenstein had left Norway to spend the summer in Vienna.</p>
<p>Dear Moore,</p>
<p>Upon clearing up some papers before leaving Skjolden I popped upon
your letter which had made me so wild.24 And upon reading it over again
I found that I had probably no sufficient reason to write to you as I
did. (Not that I like your letter a bit now.) But at any rate my wrath
has cooled down and I’d rather be friends with you again than otherwise.
I consider I have strained myself enough now for I would not have
written this to many people and if you don’t answer this I shan’t write
to you again.</p>
<p>‘Think I won’t answer it’, Moore wrote in his diary, ‘because I
really don’t want to see him again.’25 His resolve almost weakened
several times during the next few years. Wittgenstein’s name would come
up in conversation with Russell or with Desmond MacCarthy, and whenever
it did he would wonder whether he was right not to have replied. Even
though Wittgenstein (indirectly, through Pinsent) pleaded with him to
get in touch, however, he did not do so, and the breach in their
friendship was not healed until, when Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge
in 1929, they happened to meet each other on the train. But throughout
these years, thoughts of Wittgenstein haunted him so much that he
contemplated writing a diary devoted to: ‘what I feel about
Wittgenstein’.</p>
<p>After Moore’s visit Wittgenstein relapsed, as we have seen, into a
state of exhaustion. Incapable, for the moment, of doing further work in
logic, he devoted himself instead to building a small house on the side
of the Sogne fjord, about a mile away from the village. It was intended
to be a more or less permanent residence – or at least a place to live
until he had finally solved all the fundamental problems in logic. But
work on it was not finished when, in July, he returned to Vienna to
escape the tourist season in Norway. He intended to spend only the
summer away, partly in Austria with his family and partly on holiday
with Pinsent. But he was not to return to Norway until the summer of
1921, by which time the fundamental problems of logic had – temporarily
at least – been solved.</p>
