<h4 id="the-darkness-of-this-time">23 THE DARKNESS OF THIS TIME</h4>
<p>IN OCTOBER 1944 Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, frustrated at not
having finished his book and not at all enthusiastic at the prospect of
resuming his lecturing responsibilities.</p>
<p>Russell was also back in Cambridge, having spent the last six years
living and working in America. There his life had become unbearable,
owing to the hysteria and outrage whipped up against him by the more
conservative elements in American society in response to his
widely-publicized views on marriage, morals and religion, and he had
gratefully accepted the invitation to a five-year lectureship in the
quieter and calmer environment of Trinity College. He arrived, however,
to find himself out of fashion with English academic philosophers, among
whom Moore and Wittgenstein were now far more influential than Russell
himself. He brought back with him the manuscript of his History of
Western Philosophy, which, although it enjoyed a huge commercial success
(it was for many years the main source of Russell’s income), did not
improve his reputation as a philosopher.</p>
<p>Although he maintained his admiration for the keenness of Russell’s
intellect, Wittgenstein detested the popular work that Russell had
published since the 1920s. ‘Russell’s books should be bound in two
colours’, he once said to Drury:1</p>
<p>… those dealing with mathematical logic in red – and all students of
philosophy should read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in
blue – and no one should be allowed to read them.</p>
<p>Russell, Wittgenstein thought, had achieved all he was ever likely to
achieve. ‘Russell isn’t going to kill himself doing philosophy now’, he
told Malcolm, with a smile.2 And yet Malcolm recalls that, during the
1940s, on the rare occasions that Russell and Wittgenstein both attended
the Moral Science Club, ‘Wittgenstein was deferential to Russell in the
discussion as I never knew him to be with anyone else.’</p>
<p>Russell, for his part, could see no merit whatever in Wittgenstein’s
later work. ‘The earlier Wittgenstein’, he said, ‘was a man addicted to
passionately intense thinking, profoundly aware of difficult problems of
which I, like him, felt the importance, and possessed (or at least so I
thought) of true philosophical genius’:3</p>
<p>The later Wittgenstein, on the contrary, seems to have grown tired of
serious thinking and to have invented a doctrine which would make such
an activity unnecessary.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, therefore, when the two remet in the autumn of 1944
(after a break of about fourteen years), there was little warmth between
them. ‘I’ve seen Russell’, Wittgenstein wrote to Rhees after being back
about a week; he ‘somehow gave me a bad impression’.4 And after that he
had little or nothing to do with his former teacher.</p>
<p>Russell’s contempt for Wittgenstein’s later work was undoubtedly
heightened by (but not entirely attributable to) his personal pique at
being left philosophically isolated. The philosophical problems with
which he was chiefly concerned were no longer regarded as fundamental.
Partly under Wittgenstein’s influence, the Theory of Knowledge had been
subordinated to the analysis of meaning. Thus, when Human Knowledge: Its
Scope and Limits – a work which Russell conceived as a major statement
of his philosophical position – was published in 1948, it was greeted
with cool indifference. Russell’s greatest contempt, therefore, was
reserved for Wittgenstein’s disciples:</p>
<p>It is not an altogether pleasant experience to find oneself regarded
as antiquated after having been, for a time, in the fashion.5 It is
difficult to accept this experience gracefully. When Leibniz, in old
age, heard the praises of Berkeley, he remarked: ‘The young man in
Ireland who disputes the reality of bodies seems neither to explain
himself sufficiently nor to produce adequate arguments. I suspect him of
wishing to be known for his paradoxes.’ I could not say quite the same
of Wittgenstein, by whom I was superseded in the opinion of many British
philosophers. It was not by paradoxes that he wished to be known, but by
a suave evasion of paradoxes. He was a very singular man, and I doubt
whether his disciples knew what manner of man he was.</p>
<p>Moore had not suffered in the same way, but although relations
between him and Wittgenstein were still friendly, by 1944 he was too old
and infirm wholeheartedly to welcome the arduous prospect of frequent
and prolonged philosophical discussions with Wittgenstein. His wife
therefore limited Wittgenstein’s visits to one and a half hours, much to
Wittgenstein’s displeasure. ‘Moore is as nice as always’, he told
Rhees:6</p>
<p>I couldn’t see him for long as we were interrupted by Mrs Moore. She
told me later that Moore wasn’t really as well as he seemed andandandand
that he mustn’t have long conversations. I have good reason for
believing that this, on the whole, is baloney. Moore has queer blackouts
at times but then he’s an oldish man. For his age he is obviously fit.
Mrs Moore, however, doesn’t like the idea of his seeing me. Perhaps
she’s afraid that I might criticise the book which was written about him
andandandand, generally, have a bad effect on his morale.</p>
<p>The book Wittgenstein mentions is The Philosophy of G. E. Moore, a
collection of articles by a number of distinguished philosophers on
various aspects of Moore’s philosophy, edited by P. A. Schilpp and
published in 1942. Moore agreed to the book’s production, and wrote a
short autobiographical piece specially for it. Wittgenstein strongly
disapproved. ‘I fear’, he wrote to Moore after hearing about the book,
’that you may now be walking at the edge of that cliff at the bottom of
which I see lots of scientists and philosophers lying dead, Russell
amongst others.’7 When the book came out Moore was in the USA, and their
meeting in the autumn of 1944 was thus the first opportunity
Wittgenstein would have had since the book’s publication to renew his
criticism of it. Dorothy Moore’s anxieties, therefore, were probably
entirely justified.</p>
<p>In fact, Wittgenstein was wrong to blame her solely for the time
regulation imposed on his meetings with Moore. Moore had suffered a
stroke while in America, and his wife was acting on instructions from
his doctor to forbid any kind of excitement or fatigue. She therefore
limited his discussions with all his philosophical friends to one and a
half hours. Wittgenstein, she says, was the only one of them who
resented this: ’He did not realise how exhausting he could be, so much
so that at least on one occasion Moore said to me beforehand “Don’t let
him stay too long.”’8</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, however, continued in his belief that Moore was being
forced by his wife to cut short his conversations with him. Two years
later he told Malcolm that he considered it unseemly that Moore, ‘with
his great love for truth’, should be forced to break off a discussion
before it had reached its proper end. He should discuss as long as he
liked, and if he became very excited or tired and had a stroke and died
– well, that would be a decent way to die: ‘with his boots on’.9</p>
<p>Nothing should come between a philosopher and his search for the
truth. ‘Thinking is sometimes easy, often difficult but at the same time
thrilling’, he wrote to Rhees:10</p>
<p>But when it’s most important it’s just disagreeable, that is when it
threatens to rob one of one’s pet notions andandandand to leave one all
bewildered andandandand with a feeling of worthlessness. In these cases
I andandandand others shrink from thinking or can only get ourselves to
think after a long sort of struggle. I believe that you too know this
situation andandandand I wish you lots of courage! though I haven’t got
it myself. We are all sick people.</p>
<p>His mind turned to the argument he had had with Malcolm at the
beginning of the war, when Malcolm had talked about the British
‘national character’. This was a case in point – an example of when,
precisely because it is disagreeable, thinking clearly is most
important. ‘I then thought’, he wrote to Malcolm:11</p>
<p>… what is the use of studying philosophy if all that it does for you
is enable you to talk with some plausibility about some abstruse
questions of logic, etc., andandandand if it does not improve your
thinking about the important questions of everyday life, if it does not
make you more conscientious than any … journalist in the use of
DANGEROUS phrases such people use for their own ends.</p>
<p>You see, I know that it’s difficult to think well about ‘certainty’,
‘probability’, ‘perception’, etc. But it is, if possible, still more
difficult to think, or try to think, really honestly about your life
andandandand other people’s lives. And the trouble is that thinking
about these things is not thrilling, but often downright nasty. And when
it’s nasty then it’s most important.</p>
<p>Malcolm had not written for some time, and – perhaps thinking of his
break with Russell in 1914 – Wittgenstein began to think that this was
because Malcolm feared they would clash if they talked on serious
non-philosophical subjects. ‘Perhaps I was quite wrong’, he wrote:</p>
<p>But anyway, if we live to see each other again let’s not shirk
digging. You can’t think decently if you don’t want to hurt yourself. I
know all about it because I am a shirker.</p>
<p>In fact, the lapse in Malcolm’s correspondence had nothing to do with
the quarrel recalled by Wittgenstein, nor with his supposed feeling that
they would not ‘see eye to eye in very serious matters’. It had more to
do with the demands of his job as an officer with the US Navy, which
prevented his replying to Wittgenstein’s letter until May 1945, when he
wrote acknowledging that his remark about ‘national character’ had been
foolish. Unfortunately for him, he arrived in Britain before his reply
reached Wittgenstein. When his ship came into Southampton, Malcolm
obtained leave to visit Wittgenstein in Cambridge. Wittgenstein had
evidently interpreted his failure to reply as a sign that he was indeed
a ‘shirker’, unwilling to dig deep. When Malcolm arrived at Whewell’s
Court Wittgenstein did not even greet him, but nodded grimly and invited
him to sit down to a supper of powdered eggs. ‘We sat in silence for a
long time’, recalls Malcolm.12 ‘He was cold and severe the whole time.
We were not in touch with one another at all.’</p>
<p>The day after this meeting Wittgenstein received Malcolm’s letter and
immediately wrote him a warm, conciliatory reply: ‘Had I had it before I
saw you it would have made getting into contact with you rather
easier.’13 He suggested that they should, from now on, call each other
by their Christian names. But it seems perfectly possible that, had
Wittgenstein not received this acknowledgement from Malcolm of the
foolishness of his remarks on ‘national character’, and of the need to
‘dig deep’, their friendship would have come to a close.</p>
<p>During the last year of the war, both in his attempts to finish his
book and in his efforts to present his thoughts to an uncomprehending
audience in his lectures, Wittgenstein felt himself to be struggling
against superficiality and stupidity – his own as well as other people’s
– and everything else in his life was subordinated to that struggle.
‘This war’, he wrote to Hutt, ‘I believe, has a bad effect on all of
us.14 (It also seems to be gradually killing me, although I’m in good
health.)’</p>
<p>One of the few people he regarded as an ally in this struggle was
Rhees. When Rhees wrote to Wittgenstein about his own frustrations with
teaching logic to uninterested students in Swansea, Wittgenstein
responded with empathy and encouragement:</p>
<p>I’m sorry to hear about the depressing circumstances under which you
are working.15 Please don’t give in or despair! I know how immensely
depressing things can look; andandandand, of course, I’m the first man
to think of running away, but I hope you’ll pull yourself together. I
wonder what lines for a logic course I recommended. Anyhow, there is
nothing more difficult than to teach logic with any success when your
students are all half asleep. (I’ve heard Braithwaite snore in my
lectures.) Please go the bloody rough way! – I wish you one moderately
intelligent andandandand awake pupil to sweeten your labour!</p>
<p>… I repeat; Please go the bloody rough way! Complain, swear but go
on. The students are stupid but they get something out of it.</p>
<p>He was dissatisfied with his own students. ‘My class is exceedingly
poor’, he wrote to Rhees. ‘I have so far 6 people, none of whom is
really good.’</p>
<p>But a much bigger source of dissatisfaction was the fact that his
book was still so far from completion. He told Rhees: ‘I have no hope
whatever to finish my book in the near future.’ This engendered in him a
feeling of worthlessness, exacerbated by the reading of other people’s
books:</p>
<p>I have recently been reading a fair amount; a history of the Mormons
andandandand two books of Newman’s. The chief effect of this reading is
to make me feel a little more my worthlessness. Though I’m aware of it
only as a slumbering man is aware of certain noises going on around him
which, however, don’t wake him up.</p>
<p>His lectures dealt with the problems in the philosophy of psychology
that he had concentrated on in Swansea the previous summer. He had
thought of using as a text William James’s Principles of Psychology –
primarily to illustrate the conceptual confusions that he was concerned
to combat – but, as he told Rhees, ‘you were right; I didn’t take James
as my text but just talked out of my own head (or through my own
hat)’.16 In fact, what he was doing in these lectures was thinking
through the problems that he was concerned with in the section of the
Investigations that he was then writing.</p>
<p>Those problems centred on the issue between those who assert and
those who deny the existence of mental processes. Wittgenstein wanted to
do neither; he wanted to show that both sides of the issue rest on a
mistaken analogy:</p>
<p>How does the philosophical problem about mental processes and states
and about behaviourism arise? – The first step is the one that
altogether escapes notice.17 We talk of processes and states and leave
their nature undecided. Sometime perhaps we shall know more about them –
we think. But that is just what commits us to a particular way of
looking at the matter. For we have a definite concept of what it means
to learn to know a process better. (The decisive movement in the
conjuring trick has been made, and it was the very one that we thought
quite innocent.) – And now the analogy which was to make us understand
our thoughts falls to pieces. So we have to deny the yet uncomprehended
process in the yet unexplored medium. And now it looks as if we had
denied mental processes. And naturally we don’t want to deny them.</p>
<p>‘What is your aim in philosophy?’ he asks himself immediately after
this passage, and answers: ‘To show the fly the way out of the
fly-bottle.’ William James’s textbook was used to provide examples of
the sort of things that people are led to say when they are caught in
this particular fly-bottle.</p>
<p>For example, when discussing the concept of ‘the Self’ James
describes what happens when he tries to glance introspectively at his
own ‘Self of selves’. He records that what he is mostly conscious of
during these attempts at introspection are motions of the head. So he
concludes:</p>
<p>… The ‘Self of selves’, when carefully examined, is found to consist
mainly of the collection of these peculiar motions of the head or
between the head and throat.18</p>
<p>What this shows, according to Wittgenstein, is: ‘not the meaning of
the word “self” (so far as it means something like “person”, “human
being”, “he himself”, “I myself”), nor any analysis of such a thing, but
the state of a philosopher’s attention when he says the word “self” to
himself and tries to analyse its meaning.’19 And, he adds, ‘a good deal
could be learned from this’.</p>
<p>Like his use of St Augustine to illustrate the confused picture of
language that he wanted to combat, and his use of Russell to illustrate
confusions in the philosophy of mathematics, Wittgenstein’s use of James
to provide examples of confusion in the philosophy of psychology implies
no lack of respect. Just as he told Malcolm that he used the quotation
from Augustine to begin the Investigations because: ‘the conception must
be important if so great a mind held it’, so he cited James in his
remarks on psychology precisely because he held him in high regard. One
of the few books that he insisted Drury should read was James’s
Varieties of Religious Experience. Drury told him that he had already
read it: ‘I always enjoy reading anything of William James. He is such a
human person.’20 Yes, Wittgenstein replied: ‘That is what makes him a
good philosopher; he was a real human being.’</p>
<p>During the Christmas vacation in Swansea, the prospect of finishing
the book soon appeared brighter, and Wittgenstein returned to Trinity
confident that the time for publication was near. The final version of
the preface to the book is dated ‘Cambridge, January 1945’.</p>
<p>In the preface he describes the book as ‘the precipitate of
philosophical investigations which have occupied me for the last sixteen
years’ (i.e. since his return to Cambridge in 1929), and says about his
remarks:</p>
<p>I make them public with doubtful misgivings. It is not impossible
that it should fall to the lot of this work, in its poverty and in the
darkness of this time, to bring light into one brain or another – but,
of course, it is not likely.</p>
<p>Evidently the ‘doubtful misgivings’ triumphed over the inclination to
publish. Wittgenstein did not deliver his typescript to the publishers,
but instead spent the rest of the year working on an extension to it
that considerably expands his investigations into psychological
concepts.</p>
<p>For this extension he selected remarks from the manuscript volumes he
had written since 1931. He worked on this throughout the Lent and Easter
terms of 1945, and by the summer he was ready to dictate the selection
to a typist. On 13 June he wrote to Rhees:</p>
<p>The Term’s over andandandand my thoughts travel in the direction of
Swansea.21 I’ve been working fairly well since Easter. I am now
dictating some stuff, remarks, some of which I want to embody in my
first volume (if there’ll ever be one). This business of dictating will
take roughly another month or 6 weeks. After that I could leave
Cambridge.</p>
<p>Two weeks later he was in more frustrated mood. His work, he told
Malcolm, was ‘going damn slowly.22 I wish I could get a volume ready for
publishing by next autumn; but I probably shan’t. I’m a bloody bad
worker!’</p>
<p>In fact the work of dictating his remarks kept him in Cambridge until
August. The typescript he had produced was not conceived by him as a
final version of the book, but rather as something from which – together
with the typescript he had produced in Swansea the previous year – a
final version could be compiled. Nevertheless, he was now confident that
a publishable version was in sight. ‘I might publish by Christmas’, he
told Malcolm:23</p>
<p>Not that what I’ve produced is good, but it is now about as good as I
can make it. I think when it’ll be finished I ought to come into the
open with it.</p>
<p>During the months of preparing this typescript, he became
increasingly oppressed by the ‘darkness of this time’. The final stages
of the Second World War were accompanied by scenes of savagery and
inhumanity on a scale previously unimaginable. In February the
bombardment of Dresden by British and American air forces left the city
almost completely devastated, and killed 130,000 civilians. In April
Berlin fell to the Allies and Vienna to the Russians, with appalling
casualties on both sides. Shortly before the German surrender of 7 May,
pictures were released of the heaps of rotting corpses discovered by the
Allies at the concentration camps at Belsen and Buchenwald. On 14 May
Wittgenstein wrote to Hutt: ‘The last 6 months have been more nauseating
than what went before.24 I wish I could leave this country for a while
andandandand be alone somewhere as I was in Norway.’ Cambridge, he said,
‘gets on my nerves!’</p>
<p>In the British elections of July he voted for the Labour Party, and
strongly urged his friends to do the same. It was important, he felt, to
get rid of Churchill. He was convinced, as he put it to Malcolm, ‘that
this peace is only a truce’:25</p>
<p>And the pretence that the complete stamping out of the ‘aggressors’
of this war will make this world a better place to live in, as a future
war could, of course, only be started by them, stinks to high heaven
andandandand, in fact, promises a horrid future.</p>
<p>Thus, when the Japanese finally surrendered in August, the
celebrations in the streets of Swansea did nothing to lift his spirits.
‘We’ve had two VJ days’, he wrote to Malcolm, ‘andandandand I think
there was much more noise than real joy.’ In the aftermath of the war he
could see only gloom. When Hutt was demobbed, Wittgenstein wrote to him
wishing him ‘lots of luck’ – ‘I really mean: strength to bear whatever
comes.’26 He had, he told Hutt, been feeling unwell lately: ‘partly
because I’m having trouble with one of my kidneys, partly because
whatever I read of the beastliness of the Allies in Germany andandandand
Japan makes me feel sick’.</p>
<p>In the context of reports of the chronic food shortages in Germany
and Austria, and of the policy of the British army not to ‘fraternize’
with their conquered enemy, and – in the midst of this – of calls in the
Press to punish the German people for the war, Wittgenstein was
gratified to read in the News Chronicle an article by Victor Gollancz,
calling for an end to ‘self-righteousness in international affairs’ and
a determination to feed the German people: ‘not because if we don’t we
ourselves may suffer, but simply because it is right to feed our
starving neighbours’.27 After remarking on Gollancz’s article to Rhees,
he was lent Gollancz’s earlier pamphlet, What Buchenwald Really Means.
Writing as ‘a Jew who believes in Christian ethics’, Gollancz attacked
the British Press for their reaction to the horrors of Buchenwald, and
pointed out that it was wrong to hold all Germans responsible. He
further attacked the whole concept of ‘collective guilt’ as a throwback
to the Old Testament, from which the example of Christ ought to have
liberated us.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was powerfully struck by both the strengths and the
weaknesses revealed by Gollancz in his call for a humane attitude
towards the Germans. On 4 September he wrote to him praising him for his
News Chronicle article. He was, he wrote, ‘glad to see that someone,
publicly and in a conspicuous place, called a devilry a devilry’.28
About the Buchenwald pamphlet, he told Gollancz:</p>
<p>I am deeply in sympathy with your severe criticism (and it cannot be
too severe) of the cruelty, meanness and vulgarity of the daily press
and of the BBC. (Our cinema news reels are, if possible, more poisonous
still.) It is because I strongly sympathise with your attitude to these
evils that I think I ought to make what seems to me a serious criticism
of your polemic against them.</p>
<p>Gollancz, he said, had weakened the impact of his criticism by
embellishing it with subsidiary points, ‘which, even if they are not
weak and dubious, draw the reader’s attention from the main issue, and
make the polemic ineffectual’. If Gollancz wanted to be heard ‘above the
shouting of the daily press and the radio’, he would do well to stick to
the point:</p>
<p>If you really want people to remove the dirt, don’t talk to them
about the philosophical issues of the value of life and happiness. This,
if it does anything, will start academic chat.</p>
<p>In writing about the wrong attitude of people towards the Buchenwald
horrors, e.g., did you wish to convince only those who agree with you
about the Old and New Testament? Even if they do, your lengthy
quotations serve to sidetrack their attention from the one main point.
If they don’t – and an enormous number who might be seriously shaken by
your argument do not – they will feel that all this rigmarole makes the
whole article smell fishy. All the more so as they will not gladly give
up their former views.</p>
<p>I will stop now. – If you ask me why, instead of criticising you, I
don’t write articles myself, I should answer that I lack the knowledge,
the facility of expression and the time necessary for any decent and
effective journalism. In fact, writing this letter of criticism to a man
of your views and of your ability is the nearest approach to what is
denied me, i.e., to write a good article myself.</p>
<p>The letter reveals Wittgenstein’s sound appreciation of the art of
polemic. The general outlines of his advice to Gollancz were repeated
about a year later to Rush Rhees. Rhees had written an article in which
he attacked Gilbert Ryle for the latter’s enthusiastic review of Karl
Popper’s The Open Society and its Enemies, in which Popper tars Plato,
Hegel and Marx with the same brush, accusing them all of being advocates
of totalitarianism. Wittgenstein told Rhees he agreed with the tendency
of his article, but criticized him for making too many gestures and not
landing enough square blows:</p>
<p>Polemic, or the art of throwing eggs, is, as you well know, as highly
skilled a job as, say, boxing … I’d love you to throw eggs at Ryle – but
keep your face straight and throw them well! The difficulty is: not to
make superfluous noises or gestures, which don’t harm the other man but
only yourself.29</p>
<p>Gollancz, however, received Wittgenstein’s advice with disdainful
indifference. His reply (addressed to ‘L. Wiltgenstein, Esq.’) is brief
and dismissive: ‘Thank you for your letter, which I’m sure was very well
meant.’30 Wittgenstein took the rebuff good-humouredly. ‘Well, that’s
rich!’ he said to Rhees with a smile, and threw Gollancz’s note in the
fire.</p>
<p>Despite his fears for the future of Europe, and his conviction that
there would soon be another, even more horrible, war, Wittgenstein was
able to spend the late summer of 1945 enjoying a holiday in Swansea. Or,
at least, as he put it to Malcolm, ‘enjoying my absence from
Cambridge’.31</p>
<p>‘My book is gradually nearing its final form’, he told Malcolm at the
end of the summer:32</p>
<p>… andandandand if you’re a good boy andandandand come to Cambridge
I’ll let you read it. It’ll probably disappoint you. And the truth is:
it’s pretty lousy. (Not that I could improve on it essentially if I
tried for another 100 years.) This, however, doesn’t worry me.</p>
<p>These last two sentences were not true; it did worry him that his
book was not as good as he thought it ought to be, and he did think he
could improve it. And it is for precisely these two reasons that it
remained unpublished at the time of his death.</p>
<p>He dreaded going back to Cambridge to resume his professorial duties,
and implored Malcolm to come to England soon, ‘before I make up my mind
to resign the absurd job of a prof. of philosophy. It is a kind of
living death.’</p>
<p>The final version of what is now Philosophical Investigations, Part
I, was prepared during the Michaelmas and Lent terms of 1945–6. From the
typescript he had dictated during the summer he selected about 400
remarks to add to the work he had done in Swansea in 1944, and, after
some rearrangement and renumbering, this produced the 693 numbered
paragraphs of which the work now consists.</p>
<p>Thus, roughly speaking, the development of the book falls into three
identifiable stages: paragraphs 1–188 constitute Part I of the 1938
version; paragraphs 189–421 were added in 1944; and paragraphs 421–693
form the extension added in 1945–6, which was in turn compiled from
manuscripts dating from 1931–45.</p>
<p>This complicated patchwork is well described by Wittgenstein in his
preface:</p>
<p>After several unsuccessful attempts to weld my results together into
a whole, I realised that I should never succeed. The best that I could
write would never be more than philosophical remarks; my thoughts were
soon crippled if I tried to force them on in any single direction
against their natural inclination. – And this was, of course, connected
with the very nature of the investigation. For this compels us to travel
over a wide field of thought criss-cross in every direction. – The
philosophical remarks in this book are, as it were, a number of sketches
of landscapes which were made in the course of these long and involved
journeyings.</p>
<p>The same or almost the same points were always being approached
afresh from different directions, and new sketches made. Very many of
these were badly drawn or uncharacteristic, marked by all the defects of
a weak draughtsman. And when they were rejected a number of tolerable
ones were left, which now had to be arranged and sometimes cut down, so
that if you looked at them you could get a picture of the landscape.
Thus this book is really only an album.</p>
<p>Even now, there were sketches in this album that he was dissatisfied
with, and he made no attempt to publish this final rearrangement.
However, for the rest of his life he spoke of this typescript as ‘my
book’, and went through it paragraph by paragraph with a number of his
most trusted friends and students, so that when he died there would be
at least a few people to whom his book was not totally
unintelligible.</p>
<p>He was convinced his book would be fundamentally misunderstood –
especially by academic philosophers – and this was undoubtedly another
reason why the book remained unpublished in his lifetime. In a rewritten
version of the preface he states: ‘It is not without reluctance that I
deliver this book to the public’:33</p>
<p>It will fall into hands which are not for the most part those in
which I like to imagine it. May it soon – this is what I wish for it –
be completely forgotten by the philosophical journalists, and so be
preserved for a better sort of reader.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s hostility towards professional philosophy and his
dislike of Cambridge remained constant throughout his academic career,
but in the years of ‘reconstruction in Europe’ that followed the Second
World War, they seemed to become fused with a kind of apocalyptic vision
of the end of humanity. During the Easter vacation of 1946, he renewed
the acquaintance of Karl Britton, previously a student of his, and now a
lecturer in philosophy at Swansea University. One afternoon, during a
long walk along the coast, Wittgenstein told Britton that he had become
convinced that a new war was being planned, and that atomic weapons
would put an end to everything: ’They mean to do it, they mean to do
it.’34</p>
<p>What links this apocalyptic anxiety with his hostility to academic
philosophy is his detestation of the power of science in our age, which
on the one hand encouraged the philosopher’s ‘craving for generality’,
and on the other produced the atomic bomb. In a curious sense, he even
welcomed the bomb, if only the fear of it could do something to diminish
the reverence with which society regarded scientific progress. At about
the same time as his conversation with Britton, he wrote:</p>
<p>The hysterical fear over the atom bomb now being experienced, or at
any rate expressed, by the public almost suggests that at last something
really salutary has been invented.35 The fright at least gives the
impression of a really effective bitter medicine. I can’t help thinking:
if this didn’t have something good about it the philistines wouldn’t be
making an outcry. But perhaps this too is a childish idea. Because
really all I can mean is that the bomb offers a prospect of the end, the
destruction, of an evil, – our disgusting soapy water science. And
certainly that’s not an unpleasant thought.</p>
<p>‘The truly apocalyptic view of the world’, he wrote, ’is that things
do not repeat themselves.’36 The end might indeed come:</p>
<p>It isn’t absurd, e.g., to believe that the age of science and
technology is the beginning of the end for humanity; that the idea of
great progress is a delusion, along with the idea that the truth will
ultimately be known; that there is nothing good or desirable about
scientific knowledge and that mankind, in seeking it, is falling into a
trap. It is by no means obvious that this is not how things are.</p>
<p>In either case, scientific progress would come to an end. But the
most pessimistic view, for him, was one which foresaw the triumph of
science and technology:</p>
<p>Science and industry, and their progress, might turn out to be the
most enduring thing in the modern world.37 Perhaps any speculation about
a coming collapse of science and industry is, for the present and for a
long time to come, nothing but a dream; perhaps science and industry,
having caused infinite misery in the process, will unite the world – I
mean condense it into a single unit, though one in which peace is the
last thing that will find a home.</p>
<p>Because science and industry do decide wars, or so it seems.</p>
<p>‘The darkness of this time’, therefore, is directly attributable to
the worship of the false idol of science against which his own work had
been directed since the early 1930s. Thus, his ‘dream’ of the coming
collapse of science and industry was an anticipation of an age in which
his type of thinking would be more generally accepted and understood. It
is linked with his remark to Drury: ‘My type of thinking is not wanted
in this present age, I have to swim so strongly against the tide.
Perhaps in a hundred years people will really want what I am writing.’38
And yet, if ‘they’ mean to do it, and the apocalyptic view is not
absurd, then that time might never come. There never would be an age in
which his type of thinking was wanted.</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein’s political forebodings drew him closer to the Left,
his identification of the worship of science as the greatest evil kept
him at some distance from Marxism. Looking through Max Eastman’s
Marxism: Is it Science? (which he took from Rhees’s bookshelves), he
commented on Eastman’s view that Marxism has to be made more scientific
if it is to help revolution:</p>
<p>In fact, nothing is more conservative than science.39 Science lays
down railway tracks. And for scientists it is important that their work
should move along those tracks.</p>
<p>He shared with the Communists a fierce dislike of the complacency of
the British establishment, and he wanted to see some sort of revolution.
But he wanted that revolution to be a rejection of the scientific
Weltanschauung of our age, not an endorsement of it.</p>
<p>In any case, the extent to which he could identify himself with a
party was limited by his conception of himself as a philosopher – one
who in the ruthless search for truth would willingly abandon whatever
‘pet notions’ he had formed. At this time Rhees felt he ought to join
the (Trotskyist) Revolutionary Communist Party, because, as he put it to
Wittgenstein, ’I find more and more that I am in agreement with the
chief points in their analysis and criticism of present society and with
their objectives.’40 Wittgenstein was sympathetic, but tried to dissuade
him on the grounds that his duties as a loyal party member would be
incompatible with his duties as a philosopher. In doing philosophy, he
insisted, you have got to be ready constantly to change the direction in
which you are moving, and if you are thinking as a philosopher you
cannot treat the ideas of Communism differently from others.</p>
<p>Ironically, at a time when his interest in political affairs was at
its strongest, and his sympathies with the Left at their peak, he lost
the opportunity to have discussions with the Marxist intellectual for
whom he had the greatest respect. In May 1946 Piero Sraffa decided he no
longer wished to have conversations with Wittgenstein, saying that he
could no longer give his time and attention to the matters Wittgenstein
wished to discuss. This came as a great blow to Wittgenstein. He pleaded
with Sraffa to continue their weekly conversations, even if it meant
staying away from philosophical subjects. ‘I’ll talk about anything’, he
told him. ‘Yes’, Sraffa replied, ’but in your way.’41</p>
<p>Whether this was a contributory factor or not, throughout the summer
term of 1946 Wittgenstein thought increasingly often of resigning his
Chair and of leaving Cambridge. When he returned to Swansea for the
summer vacation his dislike of both Cambridge and academic philosophy
was at its peak. In Rhees’s absence, Karl Britton had to face the fury
of this distaste:</p>
<p>One day in July … Wittgenstein rang me up and explained that his
friend was away and that he wished me to take him out.42 However, he
seemed, on the whole, very hostile. The journal Mind had just published
two papers on ‘Therapeutic Positivism’ and (as I afterwards found out)
this had much annoyed and upset him. With me he was angry too for going
to the Joint Session of the Mind Association and the Aristotelian
Society, the annual jamboree of philosophers: he took it as a sign of
frivolity and of ulterior interests. He railed against professional
philosophers, mourned the state of philosophy in England and asked:
‘What can one man do alone?’ When I told him that the next jamboree was
to be held at Cambridge in 1947 and that I was to read a paper, he said:
‘Very well, to me it is just as if you had told me that there will be
bubonic plague in Cambridge next summer. I am very glad to know and I
shall make sure to be in London.’ (And so he was.)</p>
<p>Later that day Wittgenstein had tea at Britton’s home. He was in a
more genial mood, talking (in contrast to his dislike of London and
Cambridge) of his liking for Swansea. He told Britton that he liked the
North of England, too, recalling an occasion in Newcastle when he had
asked the bus conductor where to get off for a certain cinema. The
conductor at once told him that that particular cinema was showing a bad
film, and he ought to go to another. This prompted a heated argument in
the bus as to which film Wittgenstein ought to see and why. He liked
that, he told Britton; it was the sort of thing that would have happened
in Austria.</p>
<p>The final comparison is revealing, and perhaps partly accounts for
the vehemence with which he, at this time, attacked what he called ‘the
disintegrating and putrefying English civilization’.43 Put simply: he
was missing Vienna. He had not been there since before the Anschluss,
and had had very little contact since then with his family and friends
in Austria.</p>
<p>To be a professor was bad enough, but to be an English professor
became, in the end, unbearable.</p>
