<h4 id="the-fog-clears">13 THE FOG CLEARS</h4>
<p>BY THE TIME he returned to Cambridge in the autumn of 1930,
Wittgenstein had reached the resting place he had mentioned to Drury. He
had, that is, arrived at a clear conception of the correct method in
philosophy. His lectures for the Michaelmas term began on an apocalyptic
note: ‘The nimbus of philosophy has been lost’, he announced:1</p>
<p>For we now have a method of doing philosophy, and can speak of
skilful philosophers. Compare the difference between alchemy and
chemistry: chemistry has a method and we can speak of skilful
chemists.</p>
<p>The analogy of the transition from alchemy to chemistry is, in part,
misleading. It is not that Wittgenstein thought he had replaced a
mystical pseudo-science with a genuine science, but rather that he had
penetrated beyond the cloudiness and the mystique of philosophy (its
‘nimbus’) and discovered that behind it lies nothing. Philosophy cannot
be transformed into a science, because it has nothing to find out. Its
puzzles are the consequence of a misuse, a misunderstanding, of grammar,
and require, not solution, but dissolution. And the method of dissolving
these problems consists not in constructing new theories, but in
assembling reminders of things we already know:</p>
<p>What we find out in philosophy is trivial; it does not teach us new
facts, only science does that. But the proper synopsis of these
trivialities is enormously difficult, and has immense importance.
Philosophy is in fact the synopsis of trivialities.2</p>
<p>In philosophy we are not, like the scientist, building a house. Nor
are we even laying the foundations of a house. We are merely ‘tidying up
a room’.</p>
<p>This humbling of the ‘Queen of the Sciences’ is an occasion for both
triumph and despair; it signals the loss of innocence that is a symptom
of a more general cultural decay:</p>
<p>… once a method has been found the opportunities for the expression
of personality are correspondingly restricted.3 The tendency of our age
is to restrict such opportunities; this is characteristic of an age of
declining culture or without culture. A great man need be no less great
in such periods, but philosophy is now being reduced to a matter of
skill and the philosopher’s nimbus is disappearing.</p>
<p>This remark, like much else that Wittgenstein said and wrote at this
time, shows the influence of Oswald Spengler’s Decline of the West
(1918; English edition 1926). Spengler believed that a civilization was
an atrophied culture. When a culture declines, what was a living
organism rigidifies into a dead, mechanical, structure. Thus a period in
which the arts flourish is overtaken by one in which physics,
mathematics and mechanics dominate. This general view, especially as
applied to the decline of Western European culture during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, chimed perfectly with
Wittgenstein’s own cultural pessimism. One day, arriving at Drury’s
rooms looking terribly distressed, he explained that he had seen what
amounts to a pictorial representation of Spengler’s theory:</p>
<p>I was walking about in Cambridge and passed a bookshop, and in the
window were portraits of Russell, Freud and Einstein.4 A little further
on, in a music shop, I saw portraits of Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin.
Comparing these portraits I felt intensely the terrible degeneration
that had come over the human spirit in the course of only a hundred
years.</p>
<p>In an age in which the scientists have taken over, the great
personality – Weininger’s ‘Genius’ – can have no place in the mainstream
of life; he is forced into solitude. He can only potter about tidying up
his room, and distance himself from all the house-building going on
around him.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>During the Michaelmas term of 1930 Wittgenstein wrote several drafts
of a foreword for a book – not the book he was working on with Waismann,
but the typescript he had shown Russell earlier in the year. In each
draft he tried to make explicit the spirit in which he was writing, and
to distance his work from that of scientists and scientific
philosophers: to make clear, as it were, that he was working from within
the confines of his own tidy little room.</p>
<p>But here he came up against a familiar dilemma: to whom was he thus
explaining his attitude? Those who understood it would surely see it
reflected in his work, while those who did not would not understand his
explanation of it either. It was a dilemma he discussed with himself in
his notebooks: ‘Telling someone something he does not understand is
pointless, even if you add that he will not understand it.5 (That so
often happens with someone you love.)’:</p>
<p>If you have a room which you do not want certain people to get into,
put a lock on it for which they do not have the key. But there is no
point in talking to them about it, unless of course you want them to
admire the room from outside!</p>
<p>The honourable thing to do is to put a lock on the door which will be
noticed only by those who can open it, not by the rest.</p>
<p>‘But’, he added, ‘it’s proper to say that I think the book has
nothing to do with the progressive civilization of Europe and America.
And that while its spirit may be possible only in the surroundings of
this civilization, they have different objectives.’ In an early draft of
the foreword he talks explicitly about his own work in relation to that
of Western scientists:</p>
<p>It is all one to me whether or not the typical western scientist
understands or appreciates my work, since he will not in any case
understand the spirit in which I write.6 Our civilization is
characterised by the word ‘progress’. Progress is its form rather than
making progress one of its features. Typically it constructs. It is
occupied with building an ever more complicated structure. And even
clarity is sought only as a means to this end, not as an end in itself.
For me on the contrary clarity, perspicuity are valuable in
themselves.</p>
<p>I am not interested in constructing a building, so much as in having
a perspicuous view of the foundations of possible buildings.</p>
<p>So I am not aiming at the same target as the scientists and my way of
thinking is different from theirs.</p>
<p>In the final draft there is no mention of science or scientists.
Wittgenstein talks instead of the spirit ‘which informs the vast stream
of European and American civilization in which all of us stand’, and
insists that the spirit of his work is different. But the same effect is
achieved by striking a religious note:</p>
<p>I would like to say ‘This book is written to the glory of God’, but
nowadays that would be chicanery, that is, it would not be rightly
understood.7 It means the book is written in good will, and in so far as
it is not so written, but out of vanity, etc., the author would wish to
see it condemned. He cannot free it of these impurities further than he
himself is free of them.</p>
<p>Again and again in his lectures Wittgenstein tried to explain that he
was not offering any philosophical theory; he was offering only the
means to escape any need of such a theory. The syntax, the grammar, of
our thought could not be, as he had earlier thought, delineated or
revealed by analysis – phenomenological or otherwise. ‘Philosophical
analysis’, he said, ‘does not tell us anything new about thought (and if
it did it would not interest us).’8 The rules of grammar could not be
justified, nor even described, by philosophy. Philosophy could not
consist, for example, of a list of ‘fundamental’ rules of the sort that
determine the ‘depth-grammar’ (to use Chomsky’s term) of our
language:</p>
<p>We never arrive at fundamental propositions in the course of our
investigation; we get to the boundary of language which stops us from
asking further questions.9 We don’t get to the bottom of things, but
reach a point where we can go no further, where we cannot ask further
questions.</p>
<p>The ‘internal relations’ which are established by grammar cannot be
further examined or justified; we can only give examples of where rules
are used correctly and where they are used incorrectly, and say: ‘Look –
don’t you see the rule?’ For example, the relation between a musical
score and a performance cannot be grasped causally (as though we find,
mysteriously, that a certain score causes us to play in a certain way),
nor can the rules that connect the two be exhaustively described – for,
given a certain interpretation, any playing can be made to accord with a
score. Eventually, we just have to ‘see the rule in the relations
between playing and score’. If we cannot see it, no amount of
explanation is going to make it comprehensible; if we can, then there
comes a point at which explanations are superfluous – we do not need any
kind of ‘fundamental’ explanation.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s insistence on this point marks the turning point
between his ‘transitional’ phase and his mature later philosophy. The
later developments of his method, for example his use of
‘language-games’, are of less decisive importance. These developments
are of an heuristic nature: they reflect the different ways in which
Wittgenstein tried to make people see certain connections and
differences – to see their way out of philosophical dilemmas. But the
really decisive moment came when he began to take literally the idea of
the Tractatus that the philosopher has nothing to say, but only
something to show, and applied that idea with complete rigour,
abandoning altogether the attempt to say something with
‘pseudo-propositions’.</p>
<p>This emphasis on seeing connections links Wittgenstein’s later
philosophy with Spengler’s Decline of the West, and at the same time
provides the key to understanding the connection between his cultural
pessimism and the themes of his later work. In The Decline of the West
Spengler distinguishes between the Principle of Form (Gestalt) and the
Principle of Law: with the former went history, poetry and life; with
the latter went physics, mathematics and death. And on the basis of this
distinction he announces a general methodological principle: ‘The means
whereby to identify dead forms is Mathematical Law. The means whereby to
understand living forms is Analogy.’10 Thus Spengler was concerned to
understand history, not on the basis of a series of laws, but rather
through seeing analogies between different cultural epochs. What he was
concerned above all to combat was a conception of history as ‘natural
science in disguise’ – the ’taking of spiritual-political events, as
they become visible day by day on the surface at their face value, and
arranging them on a scheme of “causes” and “effects’”.11 He argued for a
conception of history that saw the historian’s job, not as gathering
facts and providing explanations, but as perceiving the significance of
events by seeing the morphological (or, as Spengler preferred to say,
physiognomic) relations between them.</p>
<p>Spengler’s notion of a physiognomic method of history was, as he
acknowledges, inspired by Goethe’s notion of a morphological study of
nature, as exemplified in Goethe’s poem Die Metamorphose der Pflanze,
which follows the development of the plant-form from the leaf through a
series of intermediate forms. Just as Goethe studied ‘the Destiny in
Nature and not the Causality’, Spengler says, ‘so here we shall develop
the form-language of human history’.12 Goethe’s morphology had as its
motivation a disgust with the mechanism of Newtonian science; he wanted
to replace this dead, mechanical, study with a discipline that sought to
‘recognize living forms as such, to see in context their visible and
tangible parts, to perceive them as manifestations of something
within’.13</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s philosophical method, which replaces theory with ‘the
synopsis of trivialities’, is in this same tradition. ‘What I give’, he
once said in a lecture, ’is the morphology of the use of an
expression.’14 In Logik, Sprache, Philosophie, the work on which he
collaborated with Waismann, the connection is made explicit:</p>
<p>Our thought here marches with certain views of Goethe’s which he
expressed in the Metamorphosis of Plants.15 We are in the habit,
whenever we perceive similarities, of seeking some common origin for
them. The urge to follow such phenomena back to their origin in the past
expresses itself in a certain style of thinking. This recognizes, so to
speak, only a single scheme for such similarities, namely the
arrangement as a series in time. (And that is presumably bound up with
the uniqueness of the causal schema). But Goethe’s view shows that this
is not the only possible form of conception. His conception of the
original plant implies no hypothesis about the temporal development of
the vegetable kingdom such as that of Darwin. What then is the problem
solved by this idea? It is the problem of synoptic presentation.
Goethe’s aphorism ‘All the organs of plants are leaves transformed’
offers us a plan in which we may group the organs of plants according to
their similarities as if around some natural centre. We see the original
form of the leaf changing into similar and cognate forms, into the
leaves of the calyx, the leaves of the petal, into organs that are half
petals, half stamens, and so on. We follow this sensuous transformation
of the type by linking up the leaf through intermediate forms with the
other organs of the plant.</p>
<p>That is precisely what we are doing here. We are collating one form
of language with its environment, or transforming it in imagination so
as to gain a view of the whole of space in which the structure of our
language has its being.</p>
<p>Explicit statements of what Wittgenstein is trying to accomplish in
his philosophical work are rare, and it is perhaps not surprising that,
as Drury has put it, ‘well-meaning commentators’ have made it appear
that Wittgenstein’s writings ‘were now easily assimilable into the very
intellectual milieu they were largely a warning against’. But, after
all, when we see somebody tidying a room, we do not usually hear them
keeping up a commentary all the while explaining what they are doing and
why they are doing it – they simply get on with the job. And it was, on
the whole, with this strictly ‘business-like’ attitude that Wittgenstein
pursued his own work.</p>
<p>At the end of the Michaelmas term of 1930 Wittgenstein was awarded a
five-year fellowship of Trinity College, the typescript that he had
shown to Russell earlier in the year (published after his death as
Philosophical Remarks) being accepted as a fellowship dissertation, with
Russell and Hardy acting as examiners. The award put an end, for the
time being, to the problem of funding his philosophical work, and gave
him the opportunity of working out the consequences of his new method in
the secure knowledge that there was indeed a demand for the ‘goods’ he
intended to provide. Replying to congratulations sent by Keynes, he
wrote: ‘Yes, this fellowship business is very gratifying.16 Let’s hope
that my brains will be fertile for some time yet. God knows if they
will!’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s attack on theory dominates his discussions with
Schlick and Waismann during the Christmas vacation of 1930. ‘For me’, he
told them, ‘a theory is without value. A theory gives me nothing.’ In
understanding ethics, aesthetics, religion, mathematics and philosophy,
theories were of no use. Schlick had, that year, published a book on
ethics in which, in discussing theological ethics, he had distinguished
two conceptions of the essence of the good: according to the first, the
good is good because it is what God wants; according to the second, God
wants the good because it is good.17 The second, Schlick said, was the
more profound. On the contrary, Wittgenstein insisted, the first is:
‘For it cuts off the way to any explanation “why” it is good, while the
second is the shallow, rationalist one, which proceeds “as if” you could
give reasons for what is good’:18</p>
<p>The first conception says clearly that the essence of the good has
nothing to do with facts and hence cannot be explained by any
proposition. If there is any proposition expressing precisely what I
think, it is the proposition ‘What God commands, that is good’.</p>
<p>Similarly, the way to any explanation of aesthetic value must be cut
off. What is valuable in a Beethoven sonata? The sequence of notes? The
feelings Beethoven had when he was composing it? The state of mind
produced by listening to it? ‘I would reply’, said Wittgenstein, ‘that
whatever I was told, I would reject, and that not because the
explanation was false but because it was an explanation’:19</p>
<p>If I were told anything that was a theory, I would say, No, no! That
does not interest me – it would not be the exact thing I was looking
for.</p>
<p>Likewise the truth, the value, of religion can have nothing to do
with the words used. There need, in fact, be no words at all. ‘Is
talking essential to religion?’ he asked:</p>
<p>I can well imagine a religion in which there are no doctrinal
propositions, in which there is thus no talking.20 Obviously the essence
of religion cannot have anything to do with the fact that there is
talking, or rather: when people talk, then this itself is part of a
religious act and not a theory. Thus it also does not matter at all if
the words used are true or false or nonsense.</p>
<p>In religion talking is not metaphorical either; for otherwise it
would have to be possible to say the same things in prose.</p>
<p>‘If you and I are to live religious lives, it mustn’t be that we talk
a lot about religion’, he had earlier told Drury, ‘but that our manner
of life is different.’21 After he had abandoned any possibility of
constructing a philosophical theory, this remark points to the central
theme of his later work. Goethe’s phrase from Faust, ‘Am Anfang war die
Tat’ (‘In the beginning was the deed’), might, as he suggested, serve as
a motto for the whole of his later philosophy.</p>
<p>The deed, the activity, is primary, and does not receive its
rationale or its justification from any theory we may have of it. This
is as true with regard to language and mathematics as it is with regard
to ethics, aesthetics and religion. ‘As long as I can play the game, I
can play it, and everything is all right’, he told Waismann and
Schlick:22</p>
<p>The following is a question I constantly discuss with Moore: Can only
logical analysis explain what we mean by the propositions of ordinary
language? Moore is inclined to think so. Are people therefore ignorant
of what they mean when they say ‘Today the sky is clearer than
yesterday’? Do we have to wait for logical analysis here? What a hellish
idea!23</p>
<p>Of course we do not have to wait: ‘I must, of course, be able to
understand a proposition without knowing its analysis.’</p>
<p>The greater part of his discussions with Waismann and Schlick that
vacation was taken up with an explanation of how this principle applies
to the philosophy of mathematics. So long as we can use mathematical
symbols correctly – so long as we can apply the rules – no ‘theory’ of
mathematics is necessary; a final, fundamental, justification of those
rules is neither possible nor desirable. This means that the whole
debate about the ‘foundations’ of mathematics rests on a misconception.
It might be wondered why, given his Spenglerian conviction of the
superiority of music and the arts over mathematics and the sciences,
Wittgenstein troubled himself so much over this particular branch of
philosophy. But it should be remembered that it was precisely this
philosophical fog that drew him into philosophy in the first place, and
that to dispel it remained for much of his life the primary aim of his
philosophical work.</p>
<p>It was the contradictions in Frege’s logic discovered by Russell that
had first excited Wittgenstein’s philosophical enthusiasm, and to
resolve those contradictions had seemed, in 1911, the fundamental task
of philosophy. He now wanted to declare such contradictions trivial, to
declare that, once the fog had cleared and these sorts of problems had
lost their nimbus, it could be seen that the real problem was not the
contradictions themselves, but the imperfect vision that made them look
like important and interesting dilemmas. You set up a game and discover
that two rules can, in certain cases, contradict one another. So what?
’What do we do in such a case? Very simple – we introduce a new rule and
the conflict is resolved.’24</p>
<p>They had seemed interesting and important because it had been assumed
that Frege and Russell were not just setting up a game, but revealing
the foundations of mathematics; if their systems of logic were
contradictory, then it looked as if the whole of mathematics were
resting on an insecure base and needed to be steadied. But this,
Wittgenstein insists, is a mistaken view of the matter. We no more need
Frege’s and Russell’s logic to use mathematics with confidence than we
need Moore’s analysis to be able to use our ordinary language.</p>
<p>Thus the ‘metamathematics’ developed by the formalist mathematician
David Hilbert is unnecessary.fn1 Hilbert endeavoured to construct a
‘meta-theory’ of mathematics, seeking to lay a provably consistent
foundation for arithmetic. But the theory he has constructed, said
Wittgenstein, is not metamathematics, but mathematics: ‘It is another
calculus, just like any other one.’ It offers a series of rules and
proofs, when what is needed is a clear view.25 ‘A proof cannot dispel
the fog’:</p>
<p>If I am unclear about the nature of mathematics, no proof can help
me. And if I am clear about the nature of mathematics, then the question
about its consistency cannot arise at all.</p>
<p>The moral here, as always, is: ‘You cannot gain a fundamental
understanding of mathematics by waiting for a theory.’26 The
understanding of one game cannot depend upon the construction of
another. The analogy with games that is invoked so frequently in these
discussions prefigures the later development of the ‘language-game’
technique, and replaces the earlier talk of ‘systems of propositions’.
The point of the analogy is that it is obvious that there can be no
question of a justification for a game: if one can play it, one
understands it. And similarly for grammar, or syntax: ’A rule of syntax
corresponds to a configuration of a game … Syntax cannot be
justified.’27</p>
<p>But, asked Waismann, couldn’t there be a theory of a game? There is,
for example, a theory of chess, which tells us whether a certain series
of moves is possible or not – whether, for instance, one can checkmate
the king in eight moves from a given position. ‘If, then, there is a
theory of chess’, he added, ‘I do not see why there should not be a
theory of the game of arithmetic, either, and why we should not use the
propositions of this theory to learn something substantial about the
possibilities of this game.28 This theory is Hilbert’s
metamathematics.’</p>
<p>No, replies Wittgenstein, the so-called ‘theory of chess’ is itself a
calculus, a game. The fact that it uses words and symbols instead of
actual chess pieces should not mislead us: ‘the demonstration that I can
get there in eight moves consists in my actually getting there in the
symbolism, hence in doing with signs what, on a chess-board, I do with
chessmen … and we agree, don’t we?, that pushing little pieces of wood
across a board is something inessential’.29 The fact that in algebra we
use letters to calculate, rather than actual numbers, does not make
algebra the theory of arithmetic; it is simply another calculus.</p>
<p>After the fog had cleared there could be, for Wittgenstein, no
question of meta-theories, of theories of games. There were only games
and their players, rules and their applications: ‘We cannot lay down a
rule for the application of another rule.’ To connect two things we do
not always need a third: ‘Things must connect directly, without a rope,
i.e. they must already stand in a connection with one another, like the
links of a chain.’30 The connection between a word and its meaning is to
be found, not in a theory, but in a practice, in the use of the word.
And the direct connection between a rule and its application, between
the word and the deed, cannot be elucidated with another rule; it must
be seen: ‘Here seeing matters essentially: as long as you do not see the
new system, you have not got it.’ Wittgenstein’s abandonment of theory
was not, as Russell thought, a rejection of serious thinking, of the
attempt to understand, but the adoption of a different notion of what it
is to understand – a notion that, like that of Spengler and Goethe
before him, stresses the importance and the necessity of ‘the
understanding that consists in seeing connections’.31</p>
<p>fn1 Hilbert’s formalist approach to the foundations of mathematics
was announced in a lecture entitled ‘On the Foundations of Logic and
Arithmetic’, delivered to the Third International Congress of
Mathematicians in Heidelberg in 1904, and developed in a series of
papers published in the 1920s. Two of the most important are reprinted
in English translations in Jean von Heijenoort, ed., From Frege to
Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic (Harvard, 1967).</p>
