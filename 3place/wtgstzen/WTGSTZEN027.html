<h4 id="a-change-of-aspect">24 A CHANGE OF ASPECT</h4>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN’S PESSIMISM ABOUT the fate of humanity was not caused by
the catastrophic events that brought the Second World War to a close –
as we have seen, it has a much longer history; but those events seemed
to reinforce in him the certitude of a long-held conviction that mankind
was headed for disaster. The mechanical means of killing people that had
been employed, and the fearsome displays of technological might that had
been witnessed – the firebombs at Dresden, the gas-ovens of the
concentration camps, the atomic bombs unleashed on Japan – established
powerfully and finally that ‘science and industry do decide wars’. And
this seemed further to convince him in his apocalyptic view that the end
of mankind was the consequence of replacing the spirit with the machine,
of turning away from God and placing our trust in scientific
‘progress’.</p>
<p>His notebooks of the post-war years abound with reflections of this
sort. A picture that intruded upon him, he wrote, was of our
civilization, ‘cheaply wrapped in cellophane, and isolated from
everything great, from God, as it were’.1 The houses, cars and other
trappings of our environment struck him as ‘separating man from his
origins, from what is lofty and eternal, etc’. It was as though life
itself was coming to an end, suffocated by the trappings of our
industrial age. And, of course, it was futile to expect to alter this
course by pointing it out. Is this journey really necessary? One might
ask the question, but it was hardly likely that, in response, mankind
would say: ‘On second thoughts, no.’ Yet Wittgenstein continued in his
work of undermining the way of thinking that, he thought, lay at the
root of the whole disaster. And in his disciples he had people who could
continue this work after his death. Not that he had any wish to found a
school, or anything of that sort. ‘I am by no means sure’, he wrote,
’that I should prefer a continuation of my work by others to a change in
the way people live which would make all these questions
superfluous.’2</p>
<p>The problem could have only an existential, never a theoretical,
solution. What was required was a change of spirit: ’Wisdom is cold and
to that extent stupid. (Faith on the other hand is a passion.)’3 To
breathe again, it was no use merely thinking correctly; one had to act –
to, as it were, rip the cellophane away and reveal the living world
behind it. As he put it: ’“Wisdom is grey”. Life on the other hand and
religion are full of colour.’4 The passion of religious faith was the
only thing capable of overcoming the deadness of theory:</p>
<p>I believe that one of the things Christianity says is that sound
doctrines are all useless.5 That you have to change your life. (Or the
direction of your life.)</p>
<p>It says that wisdom is all cold; and that you can no more use it for
setting your life to rights than you can forge iron when it is cold.</p>
<p>The point is that a sound doctrine need not take hold of you; you can
follow it as you would a doctor’s prescription. – But here you need
something to move you and turn you in a new direction. – (I.e. this is
how I understand it.) Once you have been turned round, you must stay
turned round.</p>
<p>Wisdom is passionless. But faith by contrast is what Kierkegaard
calls a passion.</p>
<p>What Russell had long ago mistakenly identified with his own
theoretical passion was, in fact, the very repudiation of it:
Wittgenstein’s was a devoutly anti-theoretical passion. Russell’s later
remark that Wittgenstein liked mysticism for its power to stop him
thinking, and his jibe that Wittgenstein had adopted a doctrine to make
serious thinking unnecessary, are in fact much nearer the mark, if we
equate ‘serious thinking’ with the attempts to formulate a true
theory.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s ideal of ‘primordial life, wild life striving to erupt
into the open’ – even though he rarely felt himself to live up to it –
is a key to understanding both the purpose of his work and the direction
of his life. In so far as he felt himself to be too theoretical, too
‘wise’, he felt deadened. The need for passion, for religion, was not
just something he saw in the world around him; it was something he felt
in himself. He felt himself to share exactly the faults characteristic
of our age, and to need the same remedy: faith and love. And just as our
age finds belief in God impossible, so he too found that he could not
pray: ’it’s as though my knees were stiff. I am afraid of dissolution
(of my own dissolution), should I become soft.’6</p>
<p>In love, too, though he felt a deep need for it, he often felt
himself incapable, frightened. And, of course, frightened of its being
taken away from him, all too conscious of its possible impermanence and
of its uncertainty. In 1946 – and it probably came as some relief to
find that he was, after all, still capable of loving someone – he fell
in love with Ben Richards, an undergraduate student of medicine at
Cambridge. Richards had what one by now perceives as the qualities that
warmed Wittgenstein’s heart: he was extraordinarily gentle, a little
timid, perhaps even docile, but extremely kind, considerate and
sensitive.</p>
<p>In his mood of deep despair after the Second World War, Wittgenstein
found at least some solace in his love for Ben – even if, at times, it
seemed that it offered this only to provide him with something else to
worry about. ‘I am very sad, very often sad’, he wrote on 8 August
1946.7 ‘I feel as though my life is now coming to an end’:</p>
<p>The only thing that my love for B. has done for me is this: it has
driven the other small worries associated with my position and my work
into the background.</p>
<p>The anxieties of being in love were perhaps the hardest to bear. And
Ben was very young – nearly forty years younger than Wittgenstein.
Wasn’t it easy to imagine, he wrote on 12 August, that Ben would
completely grow out of his love for him, ‘just as a boy no longer
remembers what he had felt as a young child’? And so, a few days later,
when he was waiting impatiently for a letter from Ben, nothing struck
him as more probable, indeed more natural, than that Ben had forsaken
him.8 And yet, every morning, when he again found no letter from Ben, it
seemed strange to him: ’I feel as though there was something I have not
yet realised; as though I had to find some standpoint from which to see
the truth more clearly.’9</p>
<p>These accounts of the almost unbearable anguish Wittgenstein felt
while waiting for a letter from his loved one strike a familiar chord.
It was the same with Pinsent, and with Skinner, and even with Kirk. Yet
in his love for Ben, there is a new note, a break with the solipsism of
the past. On 14 August, he wrote – as though it had struck him for the
first time:</p>
<p>It is the mark of a true love that one thinks of what the other
person suffers.10 For he suffers too, is also a poor devil.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fly had at last found its way out of the fly-bottle. And,
furthermore, discovered that life was not necessarily any better outside
it. To expose oneself to the elements could even be dangerous. ‘I feel’,
he wrote on 18 August, ‘that my mental health is hanging on a thin
thread’:11</p>
<p>It is of course the worry and anxiety about B. that have so worn me
out. And yet that would not be the case if I were not so easily set
aflame, ‘highly inflammable’.</p>
<p>In former times, he reflected, people went into monasteries: ’Were
they stupid or insensitive people? – Well, if people like that found
they needed to take such measures in order to be able to go on living,
the problem cannot have been an easy one!’12</p>
<p>But if love, whether human or divine, was the solution to the
problem, it was not one that could be taken; it had to be bestowed as a
gift. Thus, to combat his anxieties about other philosophers publishing
ideas derived from him, he would remind himself that his work was
worthwhile only ‘if a light shines on it from above’:13</p>
<p>And if that happens – why should I concern myself that the fruits of
my labours should be stolen? If what I am writing really has some value,
how could anyone steal the value from me? And if the light from above is
lacking, I can’t in any case be more than clever.</p>
<p>And in connection with his love for Ben, he wrote:</p>
<p>’For our desires conceal from us even what we desire. Blessings come
from above in their own guises etc.’14 I say that to myself whenever I
receive the love of B. For I well know that it is a great and rare gift;
I know too that it is a rare jewel – and also that it is not entirely of
the sort of which I had dreamed.</p>
<p>Of course, there were other reasons to get out of Cambridge. On the
very day that he arrived back there from Swansea, on 30 September,
Wittgenstein wrote:</p>
<p>Everything about the place repels me.15 The stiffness, the
artificiality, the self-satisfaction of the people. The university
atmosphere nauseates me.</p>
<p>To Fouracre he wrote: ‘What I miss most is someone I can talk
nonsense to by the yard.’16 Fouracre was the only person at Guy’s with
whom he had maintained contact. In 1943, shortly after he had married,
Fouracre had joined the army, and was sent to the Far East. He did not
return home until February 1947. While he was away he was deeply missed
by Wittgenstein, who wrote to him with remarkable frequency, urging him
to: ‘come home from that bl … Sumatra or wherever you are’. Not all
these letters have survived, but the affection which Wittgenstein held
for Fouracre is evident from those that have, including a series of six
written in as many months – from August to December 1946 – every one of
which ends with the exclamation: ‘God bless you!’ and includes a request
for Fouracre to come home quickly.</p>
<p>The first of these six is dated August 1946, and mentions some
heather which Wittgenstein picked for Fouracre and sent to him in the
Far East. It describes the ‘lousy’ situation in Europe and ends: ‘So
when you’ll come back you won’t find anything marvellous.17 But I hope
you’ll come soon nevertheless. It’ll save me a lot of trouble picking
flowers andandandand posting them to Sumatra!’</p>
<p>In their lightness of tone, and the preponderance in them of the kind
of ‘nonsense’ that Wittgenstein enjoyed, these letters are reminiscent
of those to Pattisson. There is hardly one of them that does not contain
a joke or a playful remark:</p>
<p>Sorry you don’t get post regularly, andandandand particularly my
letters which are full of content.18 I mean, paper, ink, andandandand
air. – The mosquitos don’t bite you because you’re so nice – because you
aren’t – but because you’re so bl … awful andandandand its the blood
they want. – I hope that the Dutch will soon take over for food
andandandand send you back! [7.10.46]</p>
<p>Why in hell you don’t get my letters beats me! Do you think the
Censor keeps them as souvenirs because they are so marvellous? I
shouldn’t be surprised! – Well, for God’s sake finish your tours to
South Sumatra andandandand to Central Sumatra andandandand take a plane
(I don’t mean the sort a joiner uses) andandandand get home.19
[21.10.46]</p>
<p>I’m feeling far better now than I did at the beginning of term.20 I
then felt very lousy andandandand had queer attacks of exhaustion.
Finally in despair I went to see a physician here in Cambridge … Well,
he advised me this andandandand that andandandand in the end he
mentioned that I might try a Vitamin B preparation … So, I took Vit. B.
tablets without the slightest hope that they’d help, andandandand to my
great surprise they did help. I’m taking them regularly now andandandand
I haven’t had any more attacks of exhaustion. In fact, when I’m all
tanked up with Vit. B. I get so witty that the jokes get jammed
andandandand can’t come out. Isn’t that terrible? [9.11.46]</p>
<p>The kind of simple, uncomplicated, relationship he had with Fouracre
remained for him a model of what was possible outside academic life. In
his letter of 21 October he wrote:</p>
<p>I’m thinking every day of retiring from my job andandandand taking on
something else which might bring me into a more human contact with my
fellow men.21 But what I’ll do God Knows! for I’m already a pretty old
codger.</p>
<p>The letter ends with the familiar refrain: ‘I hope you’ll come back
from that bl … Sumatra.’</p>
<p>‘Should I carry on teaching?’ he asked himself at the beginning of
November, after a meeting of the Moral Science Club, disgusted by the
vanity and stupidity of his own performance there. The ‘atmosphere’, he
wrote, was ‘wretched’.</p>
<p>His dominance of these meetings was noted with disapproval by other
philosophers at Cambridge (Broad and Russell, in particular), and by
many of the visiting lecturers. On 26 October a clash took place that
has since become famous, when Karl Popper addressed the club on the
question: ‘Are there Philosophical Problems?’ Popper’s chosen subject,
and his manner of addressing it, was deliberately designed to provoke
Wittgenstein (whom Popper thought denied the existence of philosophical
problems). And provoke him it did, although exactly in what way has
become lost in the mists of legend. Stories have been told that have
Popper and Wittgenstein coming to blows with one another, each armed
with a poker. In his autobiography Popper scotches this rumour, only to
replace it with another tale, the details of which have in turn been
challenged by some of those who were present at the time. According to
Popper, he and Wittgenstein engaged in an animated exchange on the
existence or otherwise of philosophical problems, and he gave as an
example the question of the validity of moral rules. Wittgenstein, who
had all the while been playing with a poker, then stood up, poker in
hand, and demanded an example of a moral rule. ‘Not to threaten visiting
lecturers with pokers’, Popper replied, whereupon Wittgenstein stormed
out of the room.22 Russell was present at the meeting, and made it known
that his sympathies were with Popper. An alternative account of the
argument has Popper and Wittgenstein each accusing the other of
confusing the issue, until Wittgenstein exasperatedly stormed out, with
Russell calling after him: ‘Wittgenstein, it is you who are creating all
the confusion.’</p>
<p>Whatever happened, it did nothing to affect the fervent allegiance to
Wittgenstein that was given by most of the young Cambridge philosophers
at this time. Gilbert Ryle writes that on his occasional visits to the
Moral Science Club he was disturbed to find that: ‘veneration for
Wittgenstein was so incontinent that mentions, for example, my mentions,
of any other philosopher were greeted with jeers’:23</p>
<p>This contempt for thoughts other than Wittgenstein’s seemed to me
pedagogically disastrous for the students and unhealthy for Wittgenstein
himself. It made me resolve, not indeed to be a philosophical polyglot,
but to avoid being a monoglot; and most of all to avoid being one
monoglot’s echo, even though he was a genius and a friend.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, Ryle thought, ’not only properly distinguished
philosophical from exegetic problems but also, less properly, gave the
impressions:</p>
<p>… first that he himself was proud not to have studied other
philosophers – which he had done, though not much – and second, that he
thought that people who did study them were academic and therefore
unauthentic philosophers.</p>
<p>To a certain extent Ryle is writing here as an Oxford man (his
criticisms are given in the context of extolling the virtues of the
Oxford tutorial system), but what he says about Wittgenstein’s attitude
towards reading the great works of the past is perfectly true. ‘As
little philosophy as I have read’, Wittgenstein wrote, ‘I have certainly
not read too little, rather too much.24 I see that whenever I read a
philosophical book: it doesn’t improve my thoughts at all, it makes them
worse.’</p>
<p>This attitude would never have been tolerated at Oxford, where
respect for things past is in general much stronger than at Cambridge,
and where a training in philosophy is inseparable from a reading of the
great works in the subject. It is almost inconceivable that a man who
claimed proudly never to have read a word of Aristotle would have been
given any tutorial responsibilities at all at Oxford, let alone be
allowed to preside over the affairs of the department. From
Wittgenstein’s point of view, Oxford was a ‘philosophical desert’.</p>
<p>The only time he is known to have addressed an audience of Oxford
philosophers was in May 1947, when he accepted an invitation to speak to
the Jowett Society. He was to reply to a paper presented by Oscar Wood,
the undergraduate secretary of the society, on Descartes’ ‘Cogito, ergo
sum’. The meeting was held in Magdalen College and was unusually well
attended. Mary Warnock, a contemporary of Wood’s, noted in her diary:
‘Practically every philosopher I’d ever seen was there.’25 Among the
more notable philosophers present were Gilbert Ryle, J. O. Urmson,
Isaiah Berlin and H. A. Prichard. In his reply to Wood’s paper
Wittgenstein ignored altogether the question of whether Descartes’
argument was valid, and concentrated instead on bringing his own
philosophical method to bear on the problem raised. To established
Oxford orthodoxy, in the person of H. A. Prichard, this was an unwelcome
novelty:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein: If a man says to me, looking at the sky, ‘I think it
will rain, therefore I exist,’ I do not understand him.</p>
<p>Prichard: That’s all very fine; what we want to know is: is the
cogito valid or not?</p>
<p>Prichard – described by Mary Warnock in her diary as: ‘extremely old
and deaf with a terrible cough. Totally tactless’ – several times
interrupted Wittgenstein in an effort to get him to address the question
of whether Descartes’ cogito was a valid inference or not. And every
time he did so, Wittgenstein avoided the question, implying that it was
unimportant. What Descartes was concerned with, Prichard retorted, was
far more important than any problem that Wittgenstein had discussed that
evening. He then, in Mary Warnock’s words, ‘shuffled out in disgust’. He
died about a week later.</p>
<p>Though the majority feeling at the meeting was that Pritchard had
been unbearably rude, there was also a certain degree of sympathy with
his objections, and a feeling, too, that Wittgenstein had treated Wood
with unjustifiable disdain in not addressing his reply to the substance
of Wood’s paper. Wittgenstein’s ahistorical, existential method of
philosophizing could, in the context of respect for the great
philosophers engendered at Oxford, readily be taken for arrogance.</p>
<p>The person indirectly responsible, as Wood’s intermediary, for
bringing Wittgenstein to Oxford on this occasion was Elizabeth Anscombe.
Anscombe had been an undergraduate at St Hugh’s, Oxford, and had come to
Cambridge as a postgraduate student in 1942, when she began attending
Wittgenstein’s lectures. When Wittgenstein resumed lecturing in 1944,
she was one of his most enthusiastic students. For her, Wittgenstein’s
therapeutic method was felt as a tremendous liberation, a ‘medicine’
that succeeded, where more theoretical methods had failed, in freeing
her from philosophical confusion. ‘For years’, she writes, ‘I would
spend time, in cafés, for example, staring at objects saying to myself:
“I see a packet.26 But what do I really see? How can I say that I see
here anything more than a yellow expanse?”’:</p>
<p>I always hated phenomenalism and felt trapped by it. I couldn’t see
my way out of it but I didn’t believe it. It was no good pointing to
difficulties about it, things which Russell found wrong with it, for
example. The strength, the central nerve of it remained alive and raged
achingly. It was only in Wittgenstein’s classes in 1944 that I saw the
nerve being extracted, the central thought ‘I have got this, and I
define “yellow” (say) as this’ being effectively attacked.</p>
<p>In 1946–7 she was again in Oxford, having taken up a research
fellowship at Somerville College, but she continued to go to Cambridge
once a week to attend tutorials with Wittgenstein in the company of
another student, W. A. Hijab. These tutorials, at the request of both
Hijab and Anscombe, dealt with issues in the philosophy of religion. By
the end of the year she had become one of Wittgenstein’s closest friends
and one of his most trusted students, an exception to his general
dislike of academic women and especially of female philosophers. She
became, in fact, an honorary male, addressed by him affectionately as
‘old man’. ‘Thank God we’ve got rid of the women!’ he once said to her
at a lecture, on finding, to his delight, that no (other) female
students were in attendance.</p>
<p>Anscombe was, at this time, an enthusiastic admirer of Kafka, and in
an effort to share her enthusiasm she lent Wittgenstein some of his
novels to read. ‘This man’, said Wittgenstein, returning them, ’gives
himself a great deal of trouble not writing about his trouble.’27 He
recommended, by comparison, Weininger’s The Four Last Things and Sex and
Character. Weininger, he said, whatever his faults, was a man who really
did write about his trouble.</p>
<p>This directness – this determination to strip away all inessentials
and all pretence, to ‘extract the root’ – could be unsettling as well as
inspiring, and Anscombe was fairly rare in finding it liberating. Iris
Murdoch, who attended a few of Wittgenstein’s last series of lectures,
found both him and his setting ‘very unnerving’:28</p>
<p>His extraordinary directness of approach and the absence of any sort
of paraphernalia were the things that unnerved people … with most
people, you meet them in a framework, and there are certain conventions
about how you talk to them and so on. There isn’t a naked confrontation
of personalities. But Wittgenstein always imposed this confrontation on
all his relationships. I met him only twice and I didn’t know him well
and perhaps that’s why I always thought of him, as a person, with awe
and alarm.</p>
<p>The student for whom Wittgenstein had the greatest respect during
this period was Georg Kreisel. Originally from Graz, Kreisel came to
Trinity in 1942 as an undergraduate mathematician, and attended the
lectures on the philosophy of mathematics that Wittgenstein gave during
the war. In 1944 – when Kreisel was still only twenty-one – Wittgenstein
shocked Rhees by declaring Kreisel to be the most able philosopher he
had ever met who was also a mathematician. ‘More able than Ramsey?’
Rhees asked. ‘Ramsey?!’ replied Wittgenstein.29 ‘Ramsey was a
mathematician!’</p>
<p>Although he had not written on the philosophy of mathematics for over
two years, during 1946 and 1947 Wittgenstein had regular discussions
with Kreisel on the subject. Unusually, the tenor of these discussions
was set by Kreisel rather than Wittgenstein, and when Wittgenstein’s
remarks on mathematics were published after his death, Kreisel expressed
astonishment at their tendency. After reading Remarks on the Foundations
of Mathematics, Kreisel wrote, he realized that the topics raised in the
discussions he had had with Wittgenstein: ‘were far from the centre of
his interest though he never let me suspect it’.30</p>
<p>Stimulated by his discussions with Kreisel, Wittgenstein, in his last
year at Cambridge, added regular seminars on the philosophy of
mathematics to his weekly classes on the philosophy of psychology.
Kreisel, however, remembers the discussions as being of more value than
the seminars. Wittgenstein’s public performances, he said, he found
‘tense and often incoherent’.31</p>
<p>Kreisel was not the stuff of which disciples are made, and after
leaving Cambridge he studied with Kurt Gödel and became a leading figure
in the very branch of mathematics against which Wittgenstein’s work is
an assault: the ‘cancerous growth’ of mathematical logic.
‘Wittgenstein’s views on mathematical logic are not worth much’, he
later wrote, ‘because he knew very little and what he knew was confined
to the Frege–Russell line of goods.’32 When the Blue and Brown Books
were published, his dismissal was couched in still stronger, perhaps
even bitter, terms. ‘As an introduction to the significant problems of
traditional philosophy’, he wrote in his review, ‘the books are
deplorable’:33</p>
<p>This is largely based on a personal reaction. I believe that early
contact with Wittgenstein’s outlook has hindered rather than helped me
to establish a fruitful perspective on philosophy as a discipline in its
own right.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein himself often felt that he had a bad influence on his
students. ‘The only seed I am likely to sow’, he said, ‘is a certain
jargon.’ People imitated his gestures, adopted his expressions, even
wrote philosophy in a way that made use of his techniques – all, it
seems, without understanding the point of his work.</p>
<p>He tried again and again to make this point clear. His last series of
lectures began with an emphatic and unambiguous statement of their
purpose: that of resolving the confusions to which the notion of
psychology as the ‘science of mental phenomena’ gives rise:</p>
<p>These lectures are on the philosophy of psychology.34 And it may seem
odd that we should be going to discuss matters arising out of, and
occurring in a science, seeing that we are not going to do the science
of Psychology and we have no particular information about the sort of
things that are found when the science is done. But there are questions,
puzzles that naturally suggest themselves when we look at what
psychologists may say, and what non-psychologists (and we) say.</p>
<p>Psychology is often defined as the science of Mental Phenomena. This
is a little queer, as we shall see: contrast it with physics as the
science of physical phenomena. It is the word ‘phenomena’ which may be
troublesome. We get the idea: on the one hand you have phenomena of one
kind which do certain things, on the other, phenomena of another kind
which do other things: so how do the two sorts of things compare? But
perhaps it makes no sense to say that both do the sort of things the
other does. ‘The science of mental phenomena’ – by this we mean what
everybody means, namely, the science that deals with thinking, deciding,
wishing, desiring, wondering … And an old puzzle comes up. The
psychologist when he finds his correlations finds them by watching
people doing things like screwing up their noses, getting rises in blood
pressure, looking anxious, accepting this after S seconds, reflecting
that after S plus 3 seconds, writing down ‘No’ on a piece of paper, and
so on. So where is the science of mental phenomena? Answer: You observe
your own mental happenings. How? By introspection. But if you observe,
i.e., if you go about to observe your own mental happenings you alter
them and create new ones: and the whole point of observing is that you
should not do this – observing is supposed to be just the thing that
avoids this. Then the science of mental phenomena has this puzzle: I
can’t observe the mental phenomena of others and I can’t observe my own,
in the proper sense of ‘observe’. So where are we?</p>
<p>His answer to this last question is: in a fog, a set of confusions
that cannot be resolved by the accumulation of more data – either by
introspection or by behavioural analysis. Nor can they be resolved by a
theory of thinking. The only thing capable of clearing the fog is a
conceptual investigation, an analysis of the use of words like
‘intention’, ‘willing’, ‘hope’ etc., which shows that these words gain
their meaning from a form of life, a ‘language-game’, quite different
from that of describing and explaining physical phenomena.</p>
<p>The lectures for the first two terms covered roughly the same ground
as that covered in the last third of Investigations, Part I: the
question ‘What is thinking?’, the analysis of ‘mental phenomena’ and the
investigation of particular psychological concepts such as ‘intention’,
‘willing’, ‘understanding’ and ‘meaning’.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had by now a good appreciation of the ways in which his
approach to philosophical problems was liable to be misunderstood, and
he devoted much time in these lectures to an attempt to describe his
philosophical method. In addition, he gave a talk to the Moral Science
Club on: ‘what I believe philosophy is, or what the method of philosophy
is’ (as he put it in a letter to Moore asking him to attend). One common
cause of confusion was that, though he began with a question ostensibly
about a phenomenon (‘What is thinking?’), he ended up with an
investigation into the way we use words (like ‘thinking’).</p>
<p>In his second lecture he summed up the unease that many people feel
about this procedure when he summarized what had been said in the
previous session:</p>
<p>Now let us go back to last day.35 You must remember I suggested (i)
we want analysis. This wouldn’t do unless it meant (ii) we want the
definition of thinking. And then I made a fishy step. I suggested:
Perhaps we really want the use of ‘thinking’. ‘But’, you say, ’clearly,
we don’t want to know about the “use of words”. And, in a sense, we
clearly don’t.</p>
<p>This is, we don’t want to know about the use of words for its own
sake. The point of describing the (real and imagined) use of words was
to loosen the hold of the confused way of looking at things that is the
product of the philosopher’s ‘impoverished diet’ of examples:</p>
<p>What I give is the morphology of the use of an expression.36 I show
that it has kinds of uses of which you had not dreamed. In philosophy
one feels forced to look at a concept in a certain way. What I do is
suggest, or even invent, other ways of looking at it. I suggest
possibilities of which you had not previously thought. You thought that
there was one possibility, or only two at most. But I made you think of
others. Furthermore, I made you see that it was absurd to expect the
concept to conform to those narrow possibilities. Thus your mental cramp
is relieved, and you are free to look around the field of use of the
expression and to describe the different kinds of uses of it.</p>
<p>Another problem with this method was that, in providing a richer diet
of examples, Wittgenstein was in danger of leading his students through]
the trees without giving them a glimpse of the wood. As two of these
students, D. A. T. Gasking and A. C. Jackson, recall, the difficulty in
following the lectures: ‘arose from the fact that it was hard to see
where all this rather repetitive concrete detailed talk was leading to –
how the examples were inter-connected and how all this bore on the
problems which one was accustomed to put oneself in abstract
terms’.37</p>
<p>This problem, too, Wittgenstein was aware of. ‘I am showing my pupils
details of an immense landscape’, he wrote, ’which they cannot possibly
know their way around.’38 In his lectures he elaborated on the
analogy:</p>
<p>In teaching you philosophy I’m like a guide showing you how to find
your way round London.39 I have to take you through the city from north
to south, from east to west, from Euston to the embankment and from
Piccadilly to the Marble Arch. After I have taken you many journeys
through the city, in all sorts of directions, we shall have passed
through any given street a number of times – each time traversing the
street as part of a different journey. At the end of this you will know
London; you will be able to find your way about like a born Londoner. Of
course, a good guide will take you through the more important streets
more often than he takes you down side streets; a bad guide will do the
opposite. In philosophy I’m a rather bad guide.</p>
<p>In his writing, too, Wittgenstein was concerned that he might be
spending too much time traversing side streets. He was, he said, a long
way from knowing ‘what I do and don’t need to discuss’ in the book:</p>
<p>I still keep getting entangled in details without knowing whether I
ought to be talking about such things at all; and I have the impression
that I may be inspecting a large area only eventually to exclude it from
consideration.40</p>
<p>Although he referred to the typescript he had prepared the previous
year as ‘my book’, he was deeply dissatisfied with it, particularly with
the last third of it – the analysis of psychological concepts that had
largely been drawn from earlier manuscripts. Nevertheless, one afternoon
a week he met with Norman Malcolm (who was in Cambridge during
Wittgenstein’s last year, on a Guggenheim Fellowship), to discuss the
book. He lent Malcolm a copy of the typescript with the idea that they
should read it through together, paragraph by paragraph. The procedure,
as Malcolm recalls it, was this:</p>
<p>Starting at the beginning of the work, Wittgenstein first read a
sentence aloud in German, then translated it into English, then made
some remarks to me about the meaning of it.41 He then went on to the
next sentence; and so on. At the following meeting he started at the
place where we had last stopped.</p>
<p>‘The reason I am doing this’, Wittgenstein explained, ‘is so there
will be at least one person who will understand my book when it is
published.’ This is slightly odd, in the sense that he had at this time
no intention of publishing this typescript, and was already working on a
reformulation of its final section. Contemporaneous with his discussions
with Malcolm is a series of manuscript volumes from which he hoped to
produce a more satisfactory presentation of his investigations into
psychological concepts. Not that any time was wasted, for the style of
their meetings had changed before they reached the last section of the
book. Wittgenstein’s form of ‘discussion’ proved to be too rigidly
exegetical for Malcolm’s taste; he wanted to discuss philosophical
problems that were currently puzzling him. And so Wittgenstein gradually
relaxed the procedure.</p>
<p>During the Michaelmas term of 1946, Wittgenstein’s love for Ben
Richards provided him with moments of happiness and prolonged periods of
torment. ‘All is happiness’, he wrote on 8 October.42 ‘I could not write
like this now if I had not spent the last 2 weeks with B. And I could
not have spent them as I did if illness or some accident had
intervened.’</p>
<p>But the happiness was fragile – or, at least, he felt it to be so.
‘In love I have too little faith and too little courage’, he wrote on 22
October:43</p>
<p>But I am easily hurt and afraid of being hurt, and to protect oneself
in this way is the death of all love. For real love one needs courage.
But this means one must also have the courage to make the break and
renounce [one’s love], in other words to endure a mortal wound. But I
can only hope to be spared the worst.</p>
<p>‘I do not have the courage or the strength and clarity to look the
facts of my life straight in the face’, he wrote a few days later.44 One
of these facts, he thought, was that: ‘B. has for me a pre-love [in
German there is a pun here: Vorliebe means a liking, a preference],
something that can not last’:</p>
<p>How it will fade I don’t know of course. Nor do I know how some part
of it might be preserved, alive, not pressed between the leaves of a
book as a memento.</p>
<p>He felt sure that he would lose Ben, and that conviction made it
painful to carry on in the affair. It presented a ‘frightful difficulty
of my life’: ‘I do not know whether and how I can bear to continue this
relationship with this prospect.’</p>
<p>Neither, however, could he bear the thought of ending the
relationship: ‘Whenever I imagine myself having made the break, the
loneliness terrifies me.’ And in any case, was it not a great and
wonderful gift from the heavens, which it would be almost blasphemous to
throw away? The pain and suffering of either continuing or ending the
affair seemed more than he could possibly endure.</p>
<p>But, he insisted the following day: ‘love is a joy. Perhaps a joy
mixed with pain, but a joy nevertheless.’45 And if it wasn’t a joy, then
it wasn’t love. ‘In love I have to be able to rest secure.’ As it was,
his doubts would give him no rest. That Ben was warm-hearted, he did not
doubt. ‘But can you reject a warm heart?’ The question immediately
prompted the central doubt: ‘is it a heart that beats warmly for me?’ He
quotes in English (and, therefore, presumably from Ben) the saying:
‘I’ll rather do anything than to hurt the soul of friendship’, and
continues in English (but this time surely in his own words): ‘I must
know: he won’t hurt our friendship.’ Having fallen for Ben, he demanded,
not just friendship, not just fondness, but love:</p>
<p>A person cannot come out of his skin. I cannot give up a demand that
is anchored deep inside me, in my whole life. For love is bound up with
nature; and if I became unnatural, the love would have to end. – Can I
say: ‘I will be reasonable and no longer demand it?’ … I can say: Let
him do as he pleases, – it will be different some day – Love, that is
the pearl of great price that one holds to one’s heart, that one would
exchange for nothing, that one prizes above all else.fn1 In fact it
shows – if one has it – what great value is. One learns what it means to
single out a precious metal from all others.</p>
<p>‘The frightening thing is the uncertainty.’ And in this uncertainty
Wittgenstein’s imagination tormented him with all manner of frightful
possibilities. ‘Trust in God’, he told himself.46 But the whole point
was that he was unable to trust in anything:</p>
<p>From where I am to a trust in God is a long way. Joyous hope and fear
are close cousins. I can’t have the one without its bordering on the
other.</p>
<p>And there was, too, a doubt as to whether he had any right to fall in
love. In doing so, was he not being unfaithful to the memory of Francis?
‘Ask yourself this question’, he wrote on 10 November:47</p>
<p>… when you die who will mourn for you; and how deep will their
mourning be? Who mourns for F., how deeply do I – who have more reason
to mourn than anyone – mourn for him? Did he not deserve that someone
should mourn him their whole life long? If anyone did, it was he.</p>
<p>Francis, however, was in God’s hands: ‘Here one would like to say:
God will take care of him and give him what a bad person denies him.’
His own life, though, was entirely in his own hands. An isolated phrase
two days later simply notes: ‘The fundamental insecurity of life.’48 The
foundations might at any moment give way. ‘Don’t be too cowardly to put
a person’s friendship to the test’, he urged.49 He had to know whether
his relationship with Ben would stand up to the pressure put upon it:
‘The walking-stick that looks pretty so long as one carries it, but
bends as soon as you rest your weight upon it, is worth nothing.’</p>
<p>Better, surely, to walk without a stick than use one that could not
be relied upon:</p>
<p>Can you not be cheerful even without his love? Do you have to sink
into despondency without this love? Can you not live without this prop?
For that is the question: can you not walk upright without leaning on
this staff? Or is it only that you cannot resolve to give it up.50 Or is
it both? – You mustn’t go on expecting letters that don’t arrive.</p>
<p>In so far as it was used as a prop, the relationship was not worthy:
‘It is not love that draws me to this prop, but the fact that I cannot
stand securely on my own two feet alone.’</p>
<p>Without Ben, certainly, his life would be more lonely and miserable.
But why not suffer? After all: ‘Some men are ill their whole lives and
the only happiness they know is that which comes from a few painless
hours following a long period of intense suffering (a blessed sigh of
relief)’:51</p>
<p>Is it so unheard of for a person to suffer, e.g., that an elderly
person is tired and lonely – yes even, that he becomes half-crazy?52</p>
<p>Exhaustion, loneliness, madness – these were his lot, and he had to
accept them: ’Only nothing theatrical. Of that you must guard
against.’53</p>
<p>The hardest feat was to love with hope, and not to despair if those
hopes were not fulfilled: ’The belief in a benevolent father is actually
the expression of just this life.’54</p>
<p>To live like that would be a real solution, an achievement against
which his philosophical work would pale into insignificance: ‘What good
does all my talent do me, if, at heart, I am unhappy? What help is it to
me to solve philosophical problems, if I cannot settle the chief, most
important thing?’ And what real use were his lectures?55</p>
<p>My lectures are going well, they will never go better.56 But what
effect do they leave behind? Am I helping anyone? Certainly no more than
if I were a great actor playing out tragic roles for them. What they
learn is not worth learning; and the personal impression I make does not
serve them with anything. That’s true for all of them, with, perhaps,
one or two exceptions.</p>
<p>During the summer term of 1947 Wittgenstein resolved to give up
lecturing. He told Georg von Wright that he would resign his
professorship, and that, when he did, he would like to see von Wright as
his successor.</p>
<p>The lectures that Wittgenstein gave in his last term are of
particular interest, because they introduce the issues that were to
preoccupy him for the next two years, and which found their final
expression in the typescript that now forms Part II of Philosophical
Investigations. It was in these lectures that he first introduced the
famous ambiguous figure of the duck-rabbit:</p>
<p>Suppose I show it to a child. It says ‘It’s a duck’ and then suddenly
‘Oh, it’s a rabbit.’57 So it recognises it as a rabbit. – This is an
experience of recognition. So if you see me in the street and say ‘Ah,
Wittgenstein.’ But you haven’t an experience of recognition all the
time. – The experience only comes at the moment of change from duck to
rabbit and back. In between, the aspect is as it were dispositional.</p>
<p>The point about the figure is that it can be seen under more than one
aspect: the same drawing can be seen as a duck and as a rabbit. And it
is this phenomenon of seeing-as that interested Wittgenstein. In
describing this sort of phenomenon, there is a great temptation to talk
of psychological states as if they were objects of some kind. For
example, we might say that when we see it now as a duck, now as a
rabbit, the external figure – the drawing – has not changed; what has
changed is our internal picture – our sense-datum. And if this idea were
generalized, it would lead to the very theory of sensory experience that
is the target of Wittgenstein’s philosophy of psychology – the
phenomenalist notion that the objects of our immediate experience are
the private, shadowy entities that empiricists call sense-data. It is
for fear of this kind of generalization that one of the first points
Wittgenstein makes about aspect-seeing – in the lecture quoted above and
in the Investigations – is that it is not typical; we do not see
everything as something:</p>
<p>It would have made as little sense for me to say ‘Now I am seeing it
as …’ as to say at the sight of a knife and fork ’Now I am seeing this
as a knife and fork.’58</p>
<p>But although the experience of seeing-as is not typical of all
perception, it is of particular importance to Wittgenstein, and not only
because of the dangers of phenomenalism. It could be said of his
philosophical method that its aim is to change the aspect under which
certain things are seen – for example, to see a mathematical proof not
as a sequence of propositions but as a picture, to see a mathematical
formula not as a proposition but as a rule, to see first-person reports
of psychological states (‘I am in pain’ etc.) not as descriptions but as
expressions, and so on. The ‘understanding that consists in seeing
connections’, one might say, is the understanding that results from a
change of aspect.</p>
<p>As he acknowledges in the Investigations, Wittgenstein took the
duck–rabbit figure from Joseph Jastrow’s Fact and Fable in Psychology
(1900), but his discussion of aspect-seeing owes far more to Wolfgang
Köhler than it does to Jastrow. It is Köhler’s Gestalt Psychology
(1929), and especially the chapter on ‘Sensory Organization’, that
Wittgenstein has in mind in much of his discussion. Many of the lectures
began with Wittgenstein reading a short passage from the book.</p>
<p>To understand Wittgenstein’s interest in Köhler, we have, I think, to
understand their common inheritance from Goethe. For both Köhler and
Wittgenstein the word ‘Gestalt’ had connotations of a way of
understanding that had its origins in Goethe’s morphological studies (of
colour, plants and animals). And both, in very different ways, used this
Goethean conception as a central plank in their thinking.</p>
<p>The German word ‘Gestalt’ usually means ‘shape’ or ‘form’. Köhler,
however, following Goethe, used it to mean something quite
different:</p>
<p>In the German language – at least since the time of Goethe, and
especially in his own papers on natural science – the noun ‘gestalt’ has
two meanings: besides the connotation of ‘shape’ or ‘form’ as a property
of things, it has the meaning of a concrete individual and
characteristic entity, existing as something detached and having a shape
or form as one of its attributes.59 Following this tradition, in
gestalttheorie the word ‘gestalt’ means any segregated whole.</p>
<p>This notion of a ‘segregated whole’, or, as Köhler often puts it, an
‘organized whole’, forms the basis of Köhler’s anti-behaviourist
psychology. As against the behaviourist’s mechanical model of
stimulus-response, Köhler uses what he calls a ‘dynamic’ model of human
behaviour which emphasizes the active role of organization in
perception. Our perceptions, says Köhler, are not of discrete stimuli
but of organized Gestalten: we do not, for example, see three dots on a
page; we form them into a triangle and see them as a whole, a
Gestalt.</p>
<p>Köhler’s programme for a ‘dynamic’ understanding of human psychology
has a close parallel with Goethe’s programme for a ‘dynamic’
understanding of nature. Just as Köhler is opposed to the mechanism
implicit in behaviourism, so Goethe began his scientific studies in
response to a desire to see an alternative to the mechanistic Newtonian
science of his day.</p>
<p>Goethe’s first venture in the morphological understanding of natural
forms was his study of plants. His idea – developed on his ‘Italian
Journey’ – was that plant-life could be studied systematically (but
non-mechanically) if all plants could be seen under the aspect of a
single Gestalt. For each type of natural phenomenon – for example,
plants and animals – there was to be a single form, the Urphänomen, of
which all instances of that type could be seen as metamorphoses. In the
case of plants, this Urphänomen would be the Urpflanze (the ‘original
plant’).</p>
<p>In Goethe’s work, however, there is some confusion about the nature
of this Urpflanze; at one time he regarded it as an actual plant that
might one day be discovered:</p>
<p>Here [in Italy] where, instead of being grown in pots or under glass
as they are with us, plants are allowed to grow freely in the open fresh
air and fulfil their natural destiny, they become more intelligible.60
Seeing such a variety of new and renewed forms, my old fancy suddenly
came back to mind: Among this multitude might I not discover the
Urpflanze? There certainly must be one. Otherwise, how could I reognize
that this or that form was a plant if all were not built upon the same
basic model?</p>
<p>A month later, however, he conceived it, not as something
discoverable in nature, but as something created by himself and brought
to nature as a measure of possibilities:</p>
<p>The Urpflanze is going to be the strangest creature in the world,
which Nature herself shall envy me. With this model and the key to it,
it will be possible to go on for ever inventing plants and know that
their existence is logical; that is to say, if they do not actually
exist, they could.</p>
<p>The difference between these two conceptions is of fundamental
importance. The first makes Goethe’s morphology look like a spurious
kind of pseudo-evolutionary theory – as though the task were a Darwinian
one of finding a plant from which all others are (causally) derived. The
second makes clear that the Urpflanze cannot be used to make any causal
inferences; the task of morphology is not to discover empirical laws (of
evolution etc.) but to present us with an Übersicht (a ‘synoptic view’)
of the whole field of plant-life. It is this second conception that
forms the connection between Goethe’s work and Wittgenstein’s.</p>
<p>Goethe’s morphology provided Wittgenstein with an example of a study
that seeks to clarify without explaining the phenomena with which it
deals. This type of study consists in seeing analogies. It is crucial,
however, to Wittgenstein’s understanding of this morphological
technique, that the Gestalten that are used as Urphänomene (the
Urpflanze etc.) are not themselves objects, any more than ideas or
concepts are objects. We see or recognize a Gestalt, not in the sense
that we see a physical object, but in the sense that we see or recognize
a likeness. This distinction is centrally important, but because
Gestalt, Urphänomen, Urpflanze etc. are all nouns, and we can talk of
seeing and recognizing them, is easily lost sight of. Thus, in his
discussion of aspect-seeing in the Investigations, Wittgenstein begins
with a masterfully clear statement of the distinction:</p>
<p>Two uses of the word ‘see’.61</p>
<p>The one: ‘What do you see there?’ – ‘I see this’ (and then a
description, a drawing, a copy). The other: ‘I see a likeness between
these two faces’ – let the man I tell this to be seeing the faces as
clearly as I do myself.</p>
<p>The importance of this is the difference of category between the two
‘objects’ of sight.</p>
<p>This ambiguity of the word ‘see’ lies at the root of a disagreement
that Goethe had with Schiller about the Urpflanze when Goethe tried to
explain his conception:62</p>
<p>I explained to him with great vivacity the Metamorphosis of Plants
and, with a few characteristic strokes of the pen, conjured up before
his eyes a symbolical plant.63</p>
<p>Schiller refused to regard this ‘symbolical plant’ as an object of
vision:</p>
<p>… when I had ended, he shook his head saying: This has nothing to do
with experience, it is an idea.</p>
<p>But Goethe was unmoved, and insisted that what he was talking about
was something he had seen:</p>
<p>Well, so much the better; it means that I have ideas without knowing
it, and even see them with my eyes … if he takes for an idea what to me
is an experience then there must, after all, prevail some mediation,
some relationship between the two.64</p>
<p>On Wittgenstein’s view, both Goethe and Schiller could be said to be
right: Schiller is right to insist that the Urpflanze belongs in the
same category as ideas (rather than that of physical objects), and
Goethe is right to insist that, in some sense, he sees it with his own
eyes. The philosophical task is to explain how this can be so – to
describe the phenomenon of seeing-as in such a way that it does not
appear paradoxical that a Gestalt (an ‘aspect’, an ‘organized whole’) is
at one and the same time an idea and an ‘object’ of vision.</p>
<p>The issues raised by Köhler’s Gestalt Psychology, then, were central
to Wittgenstein’s concerns. Köhler’s treatment of them, however, falls
foul of the very conceptual confusions that Wittgenstein had been trying
to dispel in his ‘Private Language Argument’. These confusions begin
with Köhler’s description of a Gestalt as ‘a concrete individual and
characteristic entity, existing as something detached and having a shape
or form as one of its attributes’. This already makes it sound as if
what was being described was an object, a private object. And this is
exactly the sort of object that Köhler needs for his theory of
perception, because he wants to say that the ‘organization’ of an object
of perception is as much a part of it as its colour and shape. This
blurs the distinction between a physical object and a mental construct
(an idea etc.), and results in a rather confused notion of a somewhat
shadowy thing:</p>
<p>If you put the ‘organisation’ of a visual impression on a level with
colours and shapes, you are proceeding from the idea of the visual
impression as an inner object. Of course this makes this object into a
chimera; a queerly shifting construction.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was likewise unhappy about Köhler’s use of the phrase
‘visual reality’ to describe what it is that changes when we ‘organize’
a perception in different ways. For example, we would not ordinarily see
the number 4 in the following figure until it was pointed out to us:</p>
<p>Köhler says about this:</p>
<p>When I tell the reader that the number 4 is before him in the field,
he will undoubtedly find it [see below]; but if he is not influenced by
theoretical prejudices, he will confess that the form of the 4 did not
exist as a visual reality at first and that, if it began to exist later
on, that meant a transformation of visual reality.65</p>
<p>In his lectures Wittgenstein ridiculed this passage as follows:</p>
<p>Now Köhler said: ‘you see two visual realities’.66 As opposed to
what? To interpreting, presumably. How does he do this? [i.e., how is
this established?] It won’t do to ask people. Köhler never says it will;
but he says ‘If you’re not blinded by theory you’ll admit there are two
visual realities.’ But of course, he can’t mean only that those who
don’t hold a certain theory will say ‘There are two visual realities.’
He must intend to say that whether or not you’re (1) blinded by theory,
or (2) whether or not you do say one thing or the other, you must, to be
right, say ‘there are two visual realities’.</p>
<hr />
<p>But in these cases of ambiguous figures (where we first see a duck
and then a rabbit, first see two unknown forms with a horizontal line
and then see the number 4 hidden in the figure), if we are not to say
that our visual reality has changed, or that the organization of the
figure has changed, then what are we to say? What has changed?
Typically, Wittgenstein wants to describe the process in such a way that
this question does not arise. Like all cases of philosophical confusion,
it is the question itself that misleads. ‘It makes no sense to ask:
“What has changed”’, Wittgenstein told his class.67 ‘And the answer:
“the organisation has changed” makes no sense either.’</p>
<p>He did not, however, find it very easy to formulate a felicitous
description of aspect-seeing that removed the confusions inherent in
Köhler’s description of it. Two years after these lectures he showed
Drury the duck–rabbit picture and said to him: ’Now you try and say what
is involved in seeing something as something. It is not easy. These
thoughts I am now working on are as hard as granite.’68</p>
<p>This strain perhaps shows in the paradoxical, and even contradictory,
descriptions that were finally published in the Investigations:</p>
<p>The expression of a change of aspect is the expression of a new
perception and at the same time of the perception’s being
unchanged.69</p>
<p>‘Seeing as …’ is not part of perception. And for that reason it is
like seeing and again not like.</p>
<p>On one thing he was clear: however it is described, it must not be by
recourse to a ‘private object’:</p>
<p>… above all do not say ‘After all my visual impression isn’t the
drawing: it is this which I can’t show to anyone.’ – Of course it is not
the drawing, but neither is it anything of the same category, which I
carry within myself.</p>
<p>He was also emphatic that the question to ask about changes of aspect
was not: ‘What changes?’ but: ‘What difference does the change make?’
Thus in his discussion of Köhler’s example of the hidden 4, Wittgenstein
replaces talk of ‘a transformation of visual reality’ with talk of the
consequences of seeing the figure differently:</p>
<p>Köhler says that very few people would of their own accord see the
figure 4 in the drawing and that is certainly true.70 Now if some man
deviates radically from the norm in his description of flat figures or
when he copies them, what difference does it make between him and normal
humans that he uses different ‘units’ in copying and describing? That is
to say, how will such a one go on to differ from normal humans in yet
other things?</p>
<p>In the case of a drawing, the consequence of seeing it differently
might be that it is copied differently (someone might, for example, with
the drawing above, start with the figure 4); in the case of a piece of
music, hearing it differently might result in its being sung, played or
whistled differently; in the case of a poem, it might be read
differently. From these examples we can perhaps see that Wittgenstein’s
dictum: ‘An “inner process” stands in need of outward criteria’ (PI, I,
580) could have (and did have) a vastly different motivation from the
superficially similar slogans of the behaviourists.</p>
<p>But this is especially clear when we consider that in the case of a
philosophical Weltanschauung the consequence of a ‘change of aspect’
might be a change of life. In Wittgenstein’s case, the consequence – the
‘outward criteria’ – that he earnestly hoped for was a culture which
treated music, poetry, art and religion with the same respect and
seriousness with which our present society treats science.</p>
<p>Was there any point in urging such a change of aspect?</p>
<p>A philosopher says ‘Look at things like this!’ – but in the first
place that doesn’t ensure that people will look at things like that, and
in the second place his admonition may come altogether too late; it’s
possible, moreover, that such an admonition can achieve nothing in any
case and that the impetus for such a change in the way things are
perceived has to originate somewhere else entirely.71</p>
<p>But that this ‘change in the way things are perceived’ should happen
somehow was crucially important to him. It was not true, as he and
Engelmann had earlier insisted, that the discrepancy between how things
are and how they ought to be always pointed to an internal change. It
was impossible not to allow the external to encroach, to have an effect.
And, somehow, one had to try and change things.</p>
<p>Or, at least, to change one’s external surroundings. Wittgenstein was
now convinced he had to get out of England. ‘In this country’, he wrote
on 13 April, ‘there is no more obvious reaction for people like me than
misanthropy.’72 The fact that one could not possibly imagine a
revolution taking place in England made it all the more depressing: ‘It
is as though one could say of this country: it has a damp, cold
spiritual climate.’ Ten days later:</p>
<p>Cambridge grows more and more hateful to me.73 The disintegrating and
putrefying English civilization. A country in which politics alternates
between an evil purpose and no purpose.</p>
<p>‘[I] feel myself to be an alien in the world’, he wrote in July.74
‘If you have no ties to either mankind or to God, then you are an
alien.’</p>
<p>As soon as the term was over he travelled to Swansea, where he was
joined for two weeks by Ben. Though he had not yet formally resigned his
Chair, he had resolved to leave England and to live alone. His thoughts
turned first to Norway, and then to Ireland. In August he went to Dublin
to visit Drury, who had recently been appointed as a psychiatrist at St
Patrick’s Hospital in Dublin. Wittgenstein was intensely interested in
the new post: ‘I wouldn’t be altogether surprised’, he told Drury, ‘if
this work in psychiatry turned out to be the right thing for you.75 You
at least know that “There are more things in heaven and earth” etc.’
Drury lent him the book which was the basis of the treatment given at St
Patrick’s – Sargant and Slater’s Physical Methods of Treatment in
Psychiatry – to which Wittgenstein responded with a characteristic
combination of an enthusiastic appreciation of the value of sound
scientific technique together with an urgent reminder of its
limitations:</p>
<p>This is an excellent book. I like the spirit in which it is
written.76 I am going to get Ben to read this book. I can quite
understand that you would adopt the attitude ‘Let’s see now what these
methods of treatment will accomplish.’</p>
<p>I don’t want for one moment to underestimate the importance of the
work you are doing; but don’t ever let yourself think that all human
problems can be solved in this way.</p>
<p>At the end of August he returned to Cambridge, resolved to resign his
Chair but still undecided whether to go to Norway or to Ireland. His
plan was to spend about a month in Vienna and then, as he put it to von
Wright:</p>
<p>… go somewhere where I can be alone for a longish time and, if
possible, to finish a part of my book … I haven’t told the Cambridge
authorities anything about it so far, as it’s not absolutely certain.77
(Though just now I can’t see how it can be avoided, I mean, my leaving
Cambridge.)</p>
<p>‘My mind just now is in great disorder’, he told von Wright:</p>
<p>It’s partly due to this: that I dread seeing Vienna again after all
that’s happened and, in a way, I also dread chucking my job at
Cambridge. But I’ll get over it.</p>
<p>The thought of returning to a Vienna that he knew would be much
altered for the worse was dreadful. And in this case the reality was
possibly even worse than the expectation. The city was still occupied by
the Russian army, who had for a time used the house Wittgenstein had
built for Gretl as a barracks and stables. The occupying army was
despised by the Austrians, and tales of brutality, rape and pillage were
common. Gretl’s servant, who had loyally done her best to protect the
Kundmanngasse house, had herself received rough treatment from the
Russians. The whole situation would have been bleak and depressing.
Friedrich von Hayek, a distant cousin of Wittgenstein’s, remembers
meeting him on a train on the way back from the visit. According to
Hayek: ‘he was reacting to having encountered the Russians at Vienna (as
an army of occupation) in a manner which suggested that he had met them
in the flesh for the first time and that this had shattered all his
illusions’.78 Though entirely wrong in thinking that this was
Wittgenstein’s first encounter with Russian people, Hayek’s impression
of his anger and disillusionment is no doubt correct. Indeed, it is
difficult to imagine any other reaction.</p>
<p>As soon as he returned from Vienna, Wittgenstein handed in his
resignation. He was told that he could take the Michaelmas term as
sabbatical leave. So, though he did not formally cease to be a professor
until the end of 1947, he was relieved of the burden both of giving
lectures and of living in Cambridge.</p>
<p>Before he left he spent a month preparing a typescript of his recent
work on the philosophy of psychology. This has now been published as
Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology, Volume I. Wittgenstein had it
typed, however, not as a separate, publishable, work, but as material to
use in his attempt to revise the last third of Philosophical
Investigations. ‘It’s mostly bad’, he told von Wright, ‘but I’ve got to
have it in a handy form, i.e. typewritten, because it may possibly give
rise to better thoughts when I read it’.79 He added:</p>
<p>I am in no way optimistic about my future, but as soon as I had
resigned I felt that it was the only natural thing to have done.</p>
<p>It is hard not to see, in his flight to Ireland and solitude, an
attempt to escape, not only Cambridge, lecturing and the English people,
but, even more painful, the torments of being close to his beloved. His
ostensible reason for being alone was to finish his book, but though he
wrote a good deal in the years that he spent in Ireland, it is difficult
to see in this work a concerted effort to bring it to completion. In
this work he was pursuing an entirely new line of thought, and the
strongest impression one gets from it is of Wittgenstein ‘philosophising
for all he is worth’ – of doing the ‘only work that really bucks me
up’.</p>

unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls, who, when he had found one
pearl of great price went and sold all that he had, and bought it.’ I’m
grateful to Dr David McLintock for drawing my attention to this
allusion.</p>
