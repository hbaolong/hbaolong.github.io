<h4 id="the-second-coming">11 THE SECOND COMING</h4>
<p>WELL, GOD HAS arrived. I met him on the 5.15 train.’1</p>
<p>Thus was Wittgenstein’s return to Cambridge announced by Keynes in a
letter to Lydia Lopokova, dated 18 January 1929. Wittgenstein had been
back in England just a few hours, and had already informed Keynes of his
plan ‘to stay in Cambridge permanently’:</p>
<p>Meanwhile we have had tea and now I retire to my study to write to
you. I see that the fatigue is going to be crushing. But I must not let
him talk to me for more than two or three hours a day.</p>
<p>For Wittgenstein, the experience of returning to a university that
had remained largely unchanged throughout the years that had brought
such a fundamental transformation in himself – and, moreover, of being
greeted by some of the very people he had left in 1913 – was strange,
almost eerie. It was, he wrote in his diary, ‘as though time had gone
backwards’.2 ‘I do not know what awaits me’, but whatever it would turn
out to be: ‘It will prove something! If time doesn’t run out’:</p>
<p>At the moment I am wandering about with great restlessness, but
around what point of equilibrium I do not know.</p>
<p>Upon his arrival there was an attempt, orchestrated by Keynes, to
welcome Wittgenstein back into the Apostolic fold. On Wittgenstein’s
second day back in England, Keynes held a special supper meeting of the
Apostles to celebrate his return. Among those attending were Richard
Braithwaite, Frank Ramsey, George Rylands, George Thomson, Alister
Watson, Anthony Blunt and Julian Bell – the cream of the current
generation of Cambridge intelligentsia. At the meeting Wittgenstein was
elected an honorary member (in Apostolic language: an ‘Angel’), a
gesture of forgiveness by the Society for his attitude towards them in
1912. At a subsequent meeting he was formally ‘declared to be absolved
from his excommunication at the appropriate time’.</p>
<p>The reason for this unprecedented humility on the part of the Society
was that, in his absence, Wittgenstein had become an almost legendary
figure among the Cambridge élite, and the Tractatus the centre of
fashionable intellectual discussion.</p>
<p>But if the Apostles had hoped to claim this ‘God’ for their own, they
were to be disappointed. Wittgenstein attended a few of their meetings,
and at dinner parties at Keynes’s house in Gordon Square he came into
contact with a few members of what might be regarded as their London
branch: the Bloomsbury group. But there was little common ground between
the peculiarly English, self-consciously ‘civilized’, aestheticism of
Bloomsbury and the Apostles, and Wittgenstein’s rigorously ascetic
sensibility and occasionally ruthless honesty. There was shock on both
sides. Leonard Woolf recalls that he was once appalled by Wittgenstein’s
‘brutally rude’ treatment of Lydia Keynes at lunch.3 At another lunch,
Wittgenstein walked out, shocked at the frank discussion of sex in the
presence of ladies. Clearly, the atmosphere of Bloomsbury was not one in
which he felt at home. Frances Partridge describes how, in contrast to
the Bells, Stracheys and Stephens with whom she mixed, Wittgenstein
seemed unable or unwilling to discuss serious matters with members of
the opposite sex: ‘in mixed company his conversation was often trivial
in the extreme, and larded with feeble jokes accompanied by a wintry
smile’.4</p>
<p>It is possible that at one of Keynes’s parties Wittgenstein and
Virginia Woolf may have met; if so, neither seems to have made much
impression on the other. After Virginia Woolf’s death Wittgenstein spoke
to Rush Rhees about the effects of her background. She grew up, he said,
in a family in which the measure of a person’s worth was his distinction
in some form of writing or in art, music, science or politics, and she
had consequently never asked herself whether there might be other
‘achievements’. This could be based on personal acquaintance, but it
could equally well be based on hearsay. There are no references to
Wittgenstein in Virginia Woolf’s diaries, and only a few incidental
mentions of him in her letters. In one of these, in a letter to Clive
Bell written a few months after Wittgenstein’s arrival in Cambridge, she
mentions him in connection with Bell’s son, Julian:</p>
<p>… Julian, Maynard says, is undoubtedly the most important
undergraduate at Kings, and may even get a Fellowship, and Maynard seems
highly impressed with him altogether, and his poetry – Julian by the way
says he tackled Maynard about Wittgenstein but was worsted.5</p>
<p>The reference is interesting only for the fact that it was Julian
Bell who was to provide, in a lengthy Drydenesque satire published in
Anthony Blunt’s student magazine, The Venture, a kind of Bloomsbury
riposte to what some began to regard as the uncivilized savagery of
Wittgenstein’s domineering, argumentative style.</p>
<p>In the poem Bell seeks to defend the Bloomsbury creed that ‘Value is
known and found in states of mind’ against the Tractatus view that such
statements are nonsense. Surely, Bell argues, Wittgenstein breaks his
own rules:</p>
<p>For he talks nonsense, numerous statements makes,6</p>
<p>Forever his own vow of silence breaks:</p>
<p>Ethics, aesthetics, talks of day and night,</p>
<p>And calls things good or bad, and wrong or right.</p>
<p>Not only does Wittgenstein talk of these things, about which he
insists one must be silent; he dominates all talk of them:</p>
<p>… who, on any issue, ever saw</p>
<p>Ludwig refrain from laying down the law?</p>
<p>In every company he shouts us down,</p>
<p>And stops our sentence stuttering his own;</p>
<p>Unceasing argues, harsh, irate and loud,</p>
<p>Sure that he’s right, and of his rightness proud,</p>
<p>Such faults are common, shared by all in part,</p>
<p>But Wittgenstein pontificates on Art.</p>
<p>The poem was written as an epistle to a fellow Apostle, Richard
Braithwaite, and expressed the view of many of the young Apostolic
aesthetes – ‘these Julian Bells’, as Wittgenstein contemptuously called
them – among whom it was greatly enjoyed. When it was published, Fania
Pascal says: ’the kindest people enjoyed a laugh; it released
accumulated tension, resentment, even fear. For no one could ever turn
the tables on Wittgenstein and pay him back in kind.’7</p>
<p>If Wittgenstein did not turn his back on the Apostles altogether,
this was chiefly because among its members was Frank Ramsey.</p>
<p>During his first year back at Cambridge, Ramsey was not only
Wittgenstein’s most valued partner in philosophical discussion, but also
his closest friend. For the first two weeks after his arrival he lived
with the Ramseys at their home in Mortimer Road. Ramsey’s wife, Lettice,
soon became a close friend and confidante – a woman who, ‘at last has
succeeded in soothing the fierceness of the savage hunter’, as Keynes
put it.8 She had the kind of robust sense of humour and earthy honesty
that could make him relax, and gain his trust. With her alone he felt
able to discuss his love for Marguerite, although, from a letter by
Frances Partridge to her husband Ralph, it appears the confidence was
not strictly kept:</p>
<p>We have seen a lot of Wittgenstein; he confides in Lettice that he is
in love with a Viennese lady, but he feels marriage to be sacred, and
can’t speak of it lightly.9</p>
<p>What is surprising here is, not that he could not speak lightly of
marriage, but that he could speak of it at all. He was at this time
writing regularly and frequently, sometimes daily, to Marguerite, but it
was not until about two years later that she realized he intended to
make her his wife, and when she did, she beat a hasty retreat. Though
flattered by his attention, and over-awed by the strength of his
personality, Marguerite did not see in Wittgenstein the qualities she
wished for in a husband. He was too austere, too demanding (and, one
suspects, just a little too Jewish). Besides, when he made clear his
intentions, he also made clear that he had a Platonic, childless,
marriage in mind – and that was not for her.</p>
<p>During his first two terms at Cambridge, Wittgenstein’s official
status was that of an ‘Advanced Student’ reading for a Ph.D., with
Ramsey, seventeen years his junior, as his supervisor. In practice, he
and Ramsey met as equals working on similar, or related, problems, and
looking to each other for criticism, guidance and inspiration. Several
times a week they would meet for many hours at a time to discuss the
foundations of mathematics and the nature of logic. These meetings were
described by Wittgenstein in his diary as ‘delightful discussions’:
‘There is something playful about them and they are, I believe, pursued
in a good spirit.’ There was, he wrote, something almost erotic about
them:10</p>
<p>There is nothing more pleasant to me than when someone takes my
thoughts out of my mouth, and then, so to speak, spreads them out in the
open.</p>
<p>‘I don’t like taking walks through the fields of science alone’, he
added.</p>
<p>Ramsey’s role in these discussions was akin to that of any other
supervisor: to raise objections to what Wittgenstein said. In the
preface to the Investigations, Wittgenstein says that he was helped by
Ramsey’s criticism – ‘to a degree which I am hardly able to estimate’ –
to realize the mistakes of the Tractatus. In a diary entry of the time,
however, he took a less generous view:</p>
<p>A good objection helps one forward, a shallow objection, even if it
is valid, is wearisome.11 Ramsey’s objections are of this kind. The
objection does not seize the matter by its root, where the life is, but
so far outside that nothing can be rectified, even if it is wrong. A
good objection helps directly towards a solution, a shallow one must
first be overcome and can, from then on, be left to one side. Just as a
tree bends at a knot in the trunk in order to grow on.</p>
<p>Despite their enormous respect for each other, there were great
differences, intellectual and temperamental, between Ramsey and
Wittgenstein. Ramsey was a mathematician, dissatisfied with the logical
foundations of his subject, who wanted to reconstruct mathematics on
sound principles. Wittgenstein was not interested in reconstructing
mathematics; his interest lay in extracting the philosophical root from
which confusion about mathematics grew. Thus, while Ramsey could look to
Wittgenstein for inspiration and Wittgenstein in Ramsey for criticism,
frustrations between the two were inevitable. Ramsey once told
Wittgenstein bluntly: ‘I don’t like your method of arguing’, while
Wittgenstein wrote of Ramsey, in a remark already quoted, that he was a
‘bourgeois thinker’ who was disturbed by real philosophical reflection
‘until he put its result (if it had one) to one side and declared it
trivial’.12</p>
<p>A ‘non-bourgeois’ thinker whose profound influence on Wittgenstein’s
development dates from this first year back at Cambridge was Piero
Sraffa. Sraffa was a brilliant Italian economist (of a broadly Marxist
persuasion), and a close friend of Antonio Gramsci, the imprisoned
Italian Communist leader. After jeopardizing his career in his home
country by publishing an attack on Mussolini’s policies, Sraffa was
invited by Keynes to come to King’s to pursue his work, and a
lectureship in economics at Cambridge was created specially for him.
Upon being introduced by Keynes, he and Wittgenstein became close
friends, and Wittgenstein would arrange to meet him at least once a week
for discussions. These meetings he came to value even more than those
with Ramsey. In the preface to the Investigations he says of Sraffa’s
criticism: ‘I am indebted to this stimulus for the most consequential
ideas of this book.’</p>
<p>This is a large claim, and – considering their widely differing
intellectual preoccupations – a puzzling one. But it is precisely
because Sraffa’s criticisms did not concern details (because, one might
say, he was not a philosopher or a mathematician) that they could be so
consequential. Unlike Ramsey, Sraffa had the power to force Wittgenstein
to revise, not this or that point, but his whole perspective. One
anecdote that illustrates this was told by Wittgenstein to both Malcolm
and von Wright, and has since been retold many times. It concerns a
conversation in which Wittgenstein insisted that a proposition and that
which it describes must have the same ‘logical form’ (or ‘grammar’,
depending on the version of the story). To this idea. Sraffa made a
Neapolitan gesture of brushing his chin with his fingertips, asking:
‘What is the logical form of that?’ This, according to the story, broke
the hold on Wittgenstein of the Tractarian idea that a proposition must
be a ‘picture’ of the reality it describes.13</p>
<p>The importance of this anecdote is not that it explains why
Wittgenstein abandoned the Picture Theory of meaning (for it does not),
but that it is a good example of the way in which Sraffa could make
Wittgenstein see things anew, from a fresh perpective. Wittgenstein told
many of his friends that his discussions with Sraffa made him feel like
a tree from which all branches had been cut. The metaphor is carefully
chosen: cutting dead branches away allows new, more vigorous ones to
grow (whereas Ramsey’s objections left the dead wood in place, forcing
the tree to distort itself around it).</p>
<p>Wittgenstein once remarked to Rush Rhees that the most important
thing he gained from talking to Sraffa was an ‘anthropological’ way of
looking at philosophical problems. This remark goes some way to explain
why Sraffa is credited as having had such an important influence. One of
the most striking ways in which Wittgenstein’s later work differs from
the Tractatus is in its ‘anthropological’ approach. That is, whereas the
Tractatus deals with language in isolation from the circumstances in
which it is used, the Investigations repeatedly emphasizes the
importance of the ‘stream of life’ which gives linguistic utterances
their meaning: a ‘language-game’ cannot be described without mentioning
their activities and the way of life of the ‘tribe’ that plays it. If
this change of perspective derives from Sraffa, then his influence on
the later work is indeed of the most fundamental importance. But in this
case, it must have taken a few years for that influence to bear fruit,
for this ‘anthropological’ feature of Wittgenstein’s philosophical
method does not begin to emerge until about 1932.</p>
<p>Apart from Ramsey and Sraffa, Wittgenstein had little to do with the
college dons at Cambridge. After the first few weeks his relations with
Keynes were confined largely to business matters, and although Keynes
became an invaluable ally whenever Wittgenstein needed anything sorted
out with the authorities, he was not a close friend. This, one gathers,
was a role that Keynes was quite happy to fit into; being Wittgenstein’s
friend demanded more time and energy than he was able, or prepared, to
give.</p>
<p>G. E. Moore happened to be on the same train from London as
Wittgenstein when Wittgenstein first arrived, and immediately their
friendship, broken since Wittgenstein’s wild letter to Moore in 1914,
was resumed. Moore, who was by this time Professor of Philosophy at
Cambridge, took responsibility for arranging the grants that enabled
Wittgenstein to continue his work; other than this, however, their
friendship was personal, rather than philosophical. Though he admired
Moore’s exactitude of expression, and would occasionally make use of it
to find the precise word he wanted to make a particular point,
Wittgenstein had little respect for him as an original philosopher.
‘Moore?’ – he once said – ’he shows you how far a man can go who has
absolutely no intelligence whatever.’14</p>
<p>Similarly with the, by now elderly, logician W. E. Johnson – another
figure from his earlier Cambridge period – Wittgenstein maintained an
affectionate friendship, despite the intellectual distance that existed
between the two. Wittgenstein admired Johnson as a pianist more than as
a logician, and would regularly attend his Sunday afternoon ‘at homes’
to listen to him play. For his part, though he liked and admired
Wittgenstein, Johnson considered his return a ‘disaster for Cambridge’.
Wittgenstein was, he said, ‘a man who is quite incapable of carrying on
a discussion’.15</p>
<p>Though he was approaching his fortieth birthday, Wittgenstein drew
his circle of friends largely from the younger generation at Cambridge –
from the undergraduates (of the non-Apostolic kind) who attended the
Moral Science Club. It was in the ‘sons of the English middle class’ who
made up this student philosophy society, according to Fania Pascal, that
Wittgenstein found the two features he required in a disciple: childlike
innocence and first-class brains. This may be so, but it is also true, I
think, that Wittgenstein simply found he had more in common with the
younger generation. He was, in a sense, very young himself. He even
looked young, and at forty was frequently mistaken for an undergraduate
himself. But more than this, he had the intellectual freshness and
suppleness of youth. ‘The mind’, he told Drury, ‘gets stiff long before
the body does’; and in this sense he was still an adolescent.16 There
was, that is, very little in his mental outlook that had become
inflexible. He had returned to Cambridge prepared to overhaul all the
conclusions he had reached up to now – prepared not only to consider new
ways of thinking, but even new ways of life. Thus he was still as
unformed, as unsettled into any particular pattern of life, as any
undergraduate.</p>
<p>Many who had heard of Wittgenstein as the author of Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus imagined him to be an old and dignified German
academic, and were unprepared for the youthfully aggressive and animated
figure they encountered at meetings of the Moral Science Club. S. K.
Bose, for example, who subsequently became one of the circle of
Wittgenstein’s friends and admirers, recalls:</p>
<p>My first encounter with Wittgenstein was at a meeting of the Moral
Science Club at which I read a paper on ‘The nature of moral
judgement’.17 It was a rather largely attended meeting and some people
were squatting on the carpet. Among them was a stranger to all of us
(except, of course, Professor Moore and one other senior member possibly
present). After I had read the paper, the stranger raised some questions
and objections in that downright fashion (but never unkind way) which
one learned later to associate with Wittgenstein. I have never been able
to live down the shame I felt when I learnt, some time later, who my
interlocutor had been, and realised how supercilious I had been in
dealing with the questions and objections he raised.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein came to dominate the discussions of the Moral Science
Club so completely that C. D. Broad, the Professor of Moral Philosophy,
stopped attending. He was not prepared, he later said, ‘to spend hours
every week in a thick atmosphere of cigarette-smoke, while Wittgenstein
punctually went through his hoops and the faithful as punctually
“wondered with a foolish look of praise”’.</p>
<p>Desmond Lee, another member of Wittgenstein’s undergraduate circle of
friends, has likened Wittgenstein, in his preference for discussions
with younger men, and in the often numbing effect he had on them, to
Socrates. Both, he points out, had an almost hypnotic influence on those
who fell under their spell. Lee himself was freed from this spell when
he left Cambridge, and, though deeply influenced by Wittgenstein, cannot
correctly be described as a disciple. His contemporary, Maurice Drury,
however, became the first, and perhaps the most perfect, example of the
young disciples described by Fania Pascal.</p>
<p>After first meeting Wittgenstein in 1929, almost every major decision
in Drury’s life was made under his influence. He had originally
intended, upon leaving Cambridge, to be ordained as an Anglican priest.
‘Don’t think I ridicule this for one minute’, Wittgenstein remarked upon
being told of the plan, ‘but I can’t approve; no, I can’t approve.18 I
would be afraid that one day that collar would choke you.’ This was on
the second, or possibly the third, occasion on which they had met. On
the next, Wittgenstein returned to the theme: ‘Just think, Drury, what
it would mean to have to preach a sermon every week; you couldn’t do
it.’ After a year at theological college, Drury agreed, and, prompted by
Wittgenstein, took a job instead among ‘ordinary people’. He worked on
projects to help the unemployed, first in Newcastle and then in South
Wales, after which, again prompted by Wittgenstein, he trained as a
doctor. After the war he specialized in psychiatry (a branch of medicine
suggested by Wittgenstein), and from 1947 until his death in 1976 worked
at St Patrick’s Hospital, Dublin, first as Resident Psychiatrist and
then as Senior Consultant Psychiatrist. His collection of essays on
philosophical problems in psychiatry, The Danger of Words, was published
in 1973 ; though much neglected, it is perhaps, in its tone and its
concerns, the most truly Wittgensteinian work published by any of
Wittgenstein’s students. ‘Why do I now bring these papers together?’ he
asks in the preface, and answers:</p>
<p>For one reason only. The author of these writings was at one time a
pupil of Ludwig Wittgenstein. Now it is well known that Wittgenstein
encouraged his pupils (those at least whom he considered had no great
originality in philosophical ability) to turn from academic philosophy
to the active study and practice of some particular avocation. In my own
case he urged me to turn to the study of medicine, not that I should
make no use of what he had taught me, but rather that on no account
should I ‘give up thinking’. I therefore hesitantly put these essays
forward as an illustration of the influence that Wittgenstein had on the
thought of one who was confronted by problems which had both an
immediate practical difficulty to contend with, as well as a deeper
philosophical perplexity to ponder over.</p>
<p>Similarly, shortly before his death, Drury published his notes of
conversations with Wittgenstein to counteract the effect of
‘well-meaning commentators’, who ‘make it appear that his writings were
now easily assimilable into the very intellectual milieu they were
largely a warning against’.19 These notes provide – perhaps more than
any other secondary source – information on the spiritual and moral
attitudes that informed Wittgenstein’s life and work. Drury is the
first, but by no means the last, disciple to illustrate that there is an
important aspect of Wittgenstein’s influence that is not, and cannot be,
covered in the large body of academic literature which Wittgenstein’s
work has inspired. The line of apostolic succession, one might say,
extends far beyond the confines of academic philosophy.</p>
<p>One of Wittgenstein’s closest undergraduate friends, indeed, was a
man who had no interest in philosophy whatever. Gilbert Pattisson met
Wittgenstein on the train coming back from Vienna after the Easter break
of 1929, and for over ten years the two enjoyed an affectionate, and
strictly non-philosophical, friendship, which came to an end during the
troubled years of the Second World War, when Wittgenstein began to
suspect Pattisson of taking a jingoistic attitude towards the war.
Pattisson was (indeed is) a genial, witty and rather worldly character,
quite unlike the innocent and over-shy disciples described by Pascal. On
completing his studies at Cambridge (with a minimum of academic effort
and commitment), he became a chartered accountant in the City of London
and led the kind of comfortable life for which his class, upbringing and
education had prepared him. With him Wittgenstein could indulge the
taste for what Frances Partridge had described as trivia and feeble
humour, but which Wittgenstein himself called simply ‘nonsense’. To have
someone with whom he could ‘talk nonsense to by the yard’ was, he said,
a deep-seated need.</p>
<p>At Cambridge, Pattisson and Wittgenstein would read together
magazines like the Tatler, delighting in their rich supply of
‘nonsense’, and enjoying particularly the ludicrous advertisements that
used to appear in such journals. They were avid readers, too, of the
‘Letters from a satisfied customer’ which used to be displayed in the
windows of Burton’s, ‘The Tailor of Taste’, and to which Pattisson and
Wittgenstein would give exaggerated attention during their shopping
trips to buy Wittgenstein’s clothes. (It may have seemed to most people
that Wittgenstein always wore the same things – an open-neck shirt, grey
flannel trousers and heavy shoes; in fact, these items were chosen with
meticulous care.)</p>
<p>After Pattisson left Cambridge, he and Wittgenstein would meet
whenever Wittgenstein passed through London (as he did frequently on his
way to and from Vienna) to go through what Wittgenstein described as
their ‘ritual’. This consisted of tea at Lyons followed by a film at one
of the big cinemas in Leicester Square. Before arriving in London,
Wittgenstein would send Pattisson a card letting him know when he was
arriving, so that Pattisson could make the necessary arrangements –
i.e. search the Evening Standard for a cinema that was showing a ‘good’
film. In Wittgenstein’s sense this meant an American film, preferably a
Western, or, later, a musical or a romantic comedy, but always one
without any artistic or intellectual pretensions. It was understood that
Pattisson’s work in the City would take second place to this ritual: ‘I
hope you won’t be busybodying in your office’, Wittgenstein wrote once,
after Pattisson had pleaded pressure of work. ‘Remember, even Bismarck
could be replaced.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s correspondence with Pattisson consists almost entirely
of ‘nonsense’. In nearly every letter he makes some use of the English
adjective ‘bloody’, which, for some reason, he found inexhaustibly
funny. He would begin his letters ‘Dear Old Blood’ and end them ‘Yours
bloodily’ or ‘Yours in bloodiness’. Pattisson would send him photographs
cut out from magazines, which he called his ‘paintings’, and to which
Wittgenstein would respond with exaggeratedly solemn appreciation: ‘I
would have known it to be a Pattisson immediately without the
signature.20 There is that bloodiness in it which has never before been
expressed by the brush.’ In reply, Wittgenstein would send ‘portraits’,
photographs of distinguished looking middle-aged men, ripped out of
newspaper advertisements for self-improvement courses. ‘My latest
photo’, he announced, enclosing one such picture. ‘The previous one
expressed fatherly kindness only; this one expresses triumph.’</p>
<p>Throughout the correspondence there is a gentle ridicule of the
language of the advertiser, the absurdity of the style being invoked
simply by using it as though it were the normal way for two friends to
write to each other. Sending Wittgenstein a (genuine) photograph of
himself, Pattisson writes on the back: ‘On the other side is pictured
one of our 47/6 suits.’ ‘Somehow or other’, Wittgenstein writes at the
end of one letter, ‘one instinctively feels that Two Steeples No.21 83
Quality Sock is a real man’s sock. It’s a sock of taste – dressy,
fashionable, comfortable.’ In a postscript to another, he writes:</p>
<p>You may through my generosity one of these days get a free sample of
Glostora the famous hair oil, may your hair always retain that gloss
which is so characteristic for well groomed gentlemen.22</p>
<p>Some of the jokes contained in Wittgenstein’s letters to Pattisson
are, indeed, astonishingly feeble. Enclosing an address that ends
‘W.C.1’, he draws an arrow to the ‘W.C.’ and writes: ‘This doesn’t mean
“Lavatory”.’ And on the back of a postcard of Christ Church Cathedral,
Dublin, he writes: ’If I remember rightly this Cathedral was built,
partly at least, by the Normans. Of course, it’s a long time ago
andandandand my memory isn’t what it was then.’23</p>
<p>Within a few months of being at Cambridge, then, Wittgenstein
established a fairly wide circle of friendships, which, to some extent,
showed his fears of entering back into society to have been misplaced.
And yet he continued to feel a foreigner at Cambridge, to feel the lack
of someone like Paul Engelmann or Ludwig Hänsel – someone with whom he
could discuss his innermost thoughts and feelings in his own language,
and with the certainty that he would be understood. Perhaps for this
reason, as soon as he returned to Cambridge, he reverted to a practice
he had not kept since the Tractatus had been published: he began to make
personal, diary-like entries in his notebooks. As before, these were
separated from his philosophical remarks by being written in the code he
had used as a child. In one of the earliest entries, he remarks how
strange it was: ‘That for so many years I have never felt the slightest
need to make notebook entries’, and reflects on the genesis of the
habit.24 In Berlin, when he began to write down thoughts about himself,
it had arisen out of a need to preserve something of himself. It had
been an important step, and though there was in it something of vanity
and imitation (of Keller and Pepys), yet it still fulfilled a genuine
requirement; it provided a substitute for a person in whom he could
confide.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein could not fully confide in the people at Cambridge
because, given the linguistic and cultural differences of which he was
far more acutely conscious than they perhaps realized, he could not feel
entirely sure that he would be understood. Whenever a misunderstanding
arose he was inclined to attribute it to those differences. ‘What a
statement seems to imply to me it doesn’t to you’, he wrote to Ramsey
after one such misunderstanding.25 ‘If you should ever live amongst
foreign people for any length of time andandandand be dependent upon
them you will understand my difficulty.’</p>
<p>His feeling that he was dependent upon people to whom he could not
make himself understood caused him intense suffering, particularly where
money was involved. In May 1929 he wrote a long letter to Keynes
attempting to explain these anxieties. ‘Please try to understand it
before you criticize it’, he pleaded, adding: ‘To write in a foreign
language makes it more difficult.’26 He had become convinced (with, as
we have seen, some justification) that Keynes had grown tired of his
conversation. ‘Now please don’t think that I mind that!’ he wrote. ‘Why
shouldn’t you be tired of me, I don’t believe for a moment that I can be
entertaining or interesting to you.’ What pained him was the fear that
Keynes might think he cultivated his friendship in order to receive
financial assistance; in his anxiety about this, and about being
misunderstood when he spoke in English, he invented a completely
fictitious confirmation of this fear:</p>
<p>In the beginning of this term I came to see you and wanted to return
you some money you had lent me. And in my clumsy way of speaking I
prefaced the act of returning it by saying ‘Oh first I want money’
meaning ‘first I want to settle the money business’ or some such phrase.
But you naturally misunderstood me and consequently made a face in which
I could read a whole story. And what followed this, I mean our
conversation about the society [the Apostles], showed me what amount of
negative feeling you had accumulated in you against me.</p>
<p>He was, however, probably right in thinking that Keynes saw himself
as his benefactor rather than his friend. But, he insisted, ‘I don’t
accept benefactions except from my friends. (That’s why I accepted your
help three years ago in Sussex.)’ He ended: ‘Please don’t answer this
letter unless you can write a short and kind answer. I did not write it
to get explanations from you but to inform you about how I think. So if
you can’t give me a kind answer in three lines, no answer will please me
best.’ Keynes’s reply to this is a masterpiece of tact and
sensitivity:</p>
<p>Dear Ludwig,</p>
<p>What a maniac you are! Of course there is not a particle of truth in
anything you say about money.27 It never crossed my mind at the
beginning of this term that you wanted anything from me except to cash a
cheque or something of that kind. I have never supposed it possible that
you could want any money from me except in circumstances in which I
should feel it appropriate to give it. When I mentioned your finances in
my note the other day, it was because I had heard that you were bothered
with heavy unexpected fees and I wanted, if this was so, to examine a
possibility which I think I suggested to you when you first came up,
namely that some help might conceivably be got out of Trinity. I had
considered whether it could be a good thing for me to do anything
myself, and had decided on the whole better not.</p>
<p>No – it was not ‘an undertone of grudge’ that made me speak rather
crossly when we last met; it was just fatigue or impatience with the
difficulty, almost impossibility, when one has a conversation about
something affecting you personally, of being successful in conveying
true impressions into your mind and keeping false ones out. And then you
go away and invent an explanation so remote from anything then in my
consciousness that it never occurred to me to guard against it!</p>
<p>The truth is that I alternate between loving and enjoying you and
your conversation and having my nerves worn to death by it. It’s no new
thing! I always have – any time these twenty years. But ‘grudge’
‘unkindness’ – if only you could look into my heart, you’d see something
quite different.</p>
<p>Without committing himself to the strains of a more intimate
friendship with Wittgenstein, Keynes managed to smooth things over to
the extent of allowing Wittgenstein to accept his help in good
conscience – of becoming a friendly benefactor, whose help was offered,
and therefore accepted, in the right spirit.</p>
<p>Without some sort of financial assistance, Wittgenstein would not
have been able to continue his philosophical work. By the end of his
second term, whatever savings he had (presumably from his earnings as an
architect) were insufficient to pay his college fees and leave anything
for him to live on. Keynes’s suggestion that he apply for a research
grant from Trinity was taken up, but there were, inevitably,
complications. These arose from the fact that the college found it hard
to understand why someone from as wealthy a background as Wittgenstein
should need a grant of this kind. Did he have any other source of money?
he was asked by Sir James Butler, the Tutor in Trinity. He answered, no.
Didn’t he have any relations who could help? He answered, yes. ‘Now as
it somehow appears as if I tried to conceal something’, he wrote to
Moore after this interview, ‘will you please accept my written
declaration that: not only I have a number of wealthy relations, but
also they would give me money if I asked them to, BUT THAT I WILL NOT
ASK THEM FOR A PENNY.’ His attitude, as he explained in another letter
to Moore, was this:28</p>
<p>I propose to do some work, and I have a vague idea, that the College
in some cases encourages such work by means of research grants,
fellowships, etc. That’s to say, I turn out some sort of goods and if
the College has any use for these goods, I would like the College to
enable me to produce them, as long as it has a use for them, and as long
as I can produce them.29</p>
<p>His application for a grant was given fulsome support by Frank
Ramsey, who in his role as Wittgenstein’s supervisor wrote to Moore
urging the necessity of such assistance. ‘In my opinion’, he wrote, ‘Mr
Wittgenstein is a philosophic genius of a different order from anyone
else I know’:30</p>
<p>This is partly owing to his great gift for seeing what is essential
in a problem and partly to his overwhelming intellectual vigour, to the
intensity of thought with which he pursues a question to the bottom and
never rests content with mere possible hypothesis. From his work more
than that of any other man I hope for a solution of the difficulties
that perplex me both in philosophy generally and in the foundations of
Mathematics in particular. It seems to be, therefore, peculiarly
fortunate that he should have returned to research.</p>
<p>Ramsey’s report on the ‘goods’ that Wittgenstein had produced so far
is, however, tantalizingly brief:</p>
<p>During the last two terms I have been in close touch with his work
and he seems to me to have made remarkable progress. He began with
certain questions in the analysis of propositions which have now led him
to problems about infinity which lie at the root of current
controversies on the foundation of Mathematics. At first I was afraid
that lack of mathematical knowledge and facility would prove a serious
handicap to his working in this field. But the progress he had made has
already convinced me that this is not so, and that here too he will
probably do work of the first importance.</p>
<p>‘He is now working very hard’, Ramsey adds, ‘and, so far as I can
judge he is getting on well. For him to be interrupted by lack of money
would be a great misfortune for philosophy.’</p>
<p>Perhaps in order to further convince the authorities, Wittgenstein
was hurriedly awarded a Ph.D. for his ‘thesis’, the Tractatus, a work
that had been in print for seven years and was already regarded by many
as a philosophical classic. The examiners were Moore and Russell, the
latter having to be somewhat reluctantly dragged up to Cambridge from
his school in Sussex. He had had no contact with Wittgenstein since
their meeting in Innsbruck in 1922, and was naturally apprehensive. ‘I
think’, he wrote to Moore, ‘that unless Wittgenstein has changed his
opinion of me, he will not much like to have me as an Examiner.31 The
last time we met he was so much pained by the fact of my not being a
Christian that he has avoided me ever since; I do not know whether pain
on this account has grown less, but he must still dislike me, as he has
never communicated with me since. I do not want him to run out of the
room in the middle of the Viva, which I feel is the sort of thing he
might do.’</p>
<p>The Viva was set for 18 June 1929, and was conducted with an air of
farcical ritual. As Russell walked into the examination room with Moore,
he smiled and said: ‘I have never known anything so absurd in my life.’
The examination began with a chat between old friends.32 Then Russell,
relishing the absurdity of the situation, said to Moore: ‘Go on, you’ve
got to ask him some questions – you’re the professor.’33 There followed
a short discussion in which Russell advanced his view that Wittgenstein
was inconsistent in claiming to have expressed unassailable truths by
means of meaningless propositions. He was, of course, unable to convince
Wittgenstein, who brought the proceedings to an end by clapping each of
his examiners on the shoulder and remarking consolingly: ‘Don’t worry, I
know you’ll never understand it.’</p>
<p>In his examiner’s report, Moore stated: ‘It is my personal opinion
that Mr Wittgenstein’s thesis is a work of genius; but, be that as it
may, it is certainly well up to the standard required for the Cambridge
degree of Doctor of Philosophy.’</p>
<p>The day after he received his Ph.D., Wittgenstein was awarded a grant
of £100 by Trinity College – £50 for the summer, and £50 for the
following Michaelmas term.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein spent the early part of the summer vacation in
Cambridge, living as a lodger with Maurice Dobb and his wife at
Frostlake Cottage, Malting House Lane. To this period belongs a brief
and uneasy friendship with the renowned literary critic F. R. Leavis.
They met at one of Johnson’s ‘at homes’, and would occasionally take
long walks together. Wittgenstein admired Leavis’s personality more than
his work; indeed, one might almost say he liked Leavis in spite of his
work. He once greeted Leavis with the words: ‘Give up literary
criticism!’ – a piece of advice in which Leavis, with striking
misjudgement, saw only the bad influence of Bloomsbury, supposing
Wittgenstein to have accepted ‘Keynes, his friends and their protégés;
as ‘the cultural élite they took themselves to be’.34</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was, Leavis recalls, working desperately hard at this
time, and was chronically short of sleep. On one occasion, when they
were out walking together until after midnight, Wittgenstein was so
exhausted that on their way back to Malting House Lane he could hardly
walk without the support of Leavis’s arm. When they finally reached
Frostlake Cottage Leavis implored him to go to bed at once. ‘You don’t
understand’, Wittgenstein replied.35 ‘When I’m engaged on a piece of
work I’m always afraid I shall die before I’ve finished it. So I make a
fair copy of the day’s work, and give it to Frank Ramsey for
safe-keeping. I haven’t made today’s copy.’</p>
<p>The work that he was then engaged in writing was the paper entitled
‘Some Remarks on Logical Form’, which has the distinction of being the
only piece of philosophical writing he published after the Tractatus. It
was printed in the conference proceedings of the 1929 Annual Joint
Session of the Aristotelian Society and the Mind Association, the most
important of the British conferences of professional philosophers, which
that year was held in Nottingham between 12 and 15 July. It is a mark of
how quickly his thought was developing at this time, however, that
almost as soon as he had sent it off to be printed he disowned it as
worthless, and, at the meeting of which it supposedly forms part of the
proceedings, read something quite different – a paper on the concept of
infinity in mathematics, which has, consequently, been lost to
posterity.</p>
<p>‘Some Remarks on Logical Form’ is nonetheless interesting as a record
of a transitory phase in the development of Wittgenstein’s philosophy –
a phase in which the logical edifice of the Tractatus, though crumbling,
had not yet been demolished altogether. The paper can be seen as an
attempt to answer criticisms made by Frank Ramsey of Wittgenstein’s
discussion of colour-exclusion in the Tractatus. Ramsey’s objections
were first raised in his review of the Tractatus; no doubt they had been
explored further in discussions between the two in the first two terms
of 1929.</p>
<p>In proposition 6.375 of the Tractatus Wittgenstein had insisted:
‘Just as the only necessity that exists is logical necessity, so too the
only impossibility that exists is logical impossibility’, and had gone
on in the following proposition to apply this to the impossibility of
something’s being, say, both red and blue:</p>
<p>… the simultaneous presence of two colours at the same place in the
visual field is impossible, in fact, logically impossible, since it is
ruled out by the logical structure of colour.</p>
<p>The problem here is that, if this is so, then the statement ‘This is
red’ cannot be an atomic proposition. In the Tractatus it is claimed
that atomic propositions are logically independent of one another, with
‘This is red’ quite clearly not being independent of ‘This is blue’: the
truth of one implies the falsehood of the other. Thus, ascriptions of
colour have to be complex, susceptible to further analysis. In the
Tractatus Wittgenstein had appealed to the analysis of colour in terms
of the velocities of particles as a way out of this difficulty. Thus,
the impossibility of something’s being both red and blue appears as the
following contradiction: ‘a particle cannot have two velocities at the
same time; that is to say, it cannot be in two places at the same time’.
But, as Ramsey insisted, even at this level of analysis the problem
reappears:</p>
<p>…even supposing that the physicist thus provides an analysis of what
we mean by ‘red’, Mr Wittgenstein is only reducing the difficulty to
that of the necessary properties of space, time, and matter or the
ether.36 He explicitly makes it depend on the impossibility of a
particle being in two places at the same time.</p>
<p>And it is still hard to see, says Ramsey, how this can be a matter of
logic rather than of physics.</p>
<p>Ramsey’s remarks thus presented Wittgenstein with a challenge: he
must either show how the properties of space, time and matter can appear
as logical necessities, or provide an alternative account of
colour-exclusion. In ‘Some Remarks on Logical Form’, Wittgenstein chose
the latter.</p>
<p>He now abandons the claim that atomic propositions are independent;
the truth of one can indeed imply the falsity of another, and ‘This is
both red and blue’ is, therefore, ‘ruled out’. But if this is so, then
there is something seriously amiss with the analysis of the rules of
logical form that was offered in the Tractatus. For, by the Tractatus
rules, such constructions are ruled out only if they can be analysed
into forms such as ‘p and not-p’, which can be shown to be contradictory
by the Truth-Table Method. The paper therefore ends on a problematic
note:</p>
<p>It is, of course, a deficiency of our notation that it does not
prevent the formation of such nonsensical constructions, and a perfect
notation will have to exclude such structures by definite rules of
syntax … Such rules, however, cannot be laid down until we have actually
reached the ultimate analysis of the phenomena in question.37 This, we
all know, has not yet been achieved.</p>
<p>In the work written during the following year Wittgenstein made some
attempt to provide ‘the ultimate analysis of the phenomena in question’,
and for this short period his work became, as he described it, a kind of
phenomenology. Prompted by his discussions with Sraffa, however, he soon
gave up the attempt to repair the structure of the Tractatus, and
abandoned altogether the idea that there had to be a commonality of
structure between the world and language. Indeed, the point at which he
abandoned it is perhaps the point at which he decided he could not read
this paper before the conference. For the paper does not present the
solution to the problem raised by Ramsey so much as an admission that,
within the terms of the Tractatus, Wittgenstein had no solution.</p>
<p>Having decided to speak instead on the concept of infinity in
mathematics, he wrote to Russell asking him to attend – ‘as your
presence would improve the discussion immensely and perhaps would be the
only thing making it worth while at all’.38 It was the first and only
time in his career that Wittgenstein attended such a conference, and, as
he explained to Russell, he had no great hopes for it: ‘I fear that
whatever one says to them will either fall flat or arouse irrelevant
troubles in their minds.’ What he had to say about infinity would, he
feared, ‘be all Chinese to them’.</p>
<p>The Oxford philosopher, John Mabbott, recalls that when he arrived in
Nottingham to attend the conference he met at the student hostel a
youngish man with a rucksack, shorts and open-neck shirt. Never having
seen Wittgenstein before, he assumed that this was a student on vacation
who did not know his hostel had been given over to those attending the
conference. ‘I’m afraid there is a gathering of philosophers going on in
here’, he said kindly. Wittgenstein replied darkly: ’I too.’39</p>
<p>In the event, Russell did not attend, and the conference served only
to confirm Wittgenstein’s contempt for such gatherings. One positive
consequence of the meeting, however, was that he struck up a friendship
with Gilbert Ryle, who had, as Ryle writes in his autobiographical
notes, ‘for some time been a mystified admirer’. According to
Wittgenstein it was the serious and interested expression on Ryle’s face
during Wittgenstein’s paper that attracted his attention, and compelled
him to make Ryle’s acquaintance.40 Later, Ryle became convinced that
Wittgenstein’s influence on his students was detrimental, and
Wittgenstein that Ryle was not, after all, serious. But throughout the
1930s the two enjoyed a cordial relationship, and occasionally
accompanied each other on walking holidays. Their conversation on these
walks was as likely to touch on films as on philosophy, Ryle stoutly
resisting Wittgenstein’s contention that, not only had a good British
film never been made, but such a thing was an impossibility – almost,
one might say (subject to further analysis), a logical
impossibility.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s conviction that his paper on infinity would be ‘all
Chinese’ to the philosophers gathered at Nottingham is a typical
expression of a recurrent feeling that whatever he said would be liable
to be misunderstood. He was, he felt, surrounded by people unable to
understand him. Even Ramsey was unable to follow him in his radical
departures from the theory of the Tractatus. In September we find him
complaining in his diary about Ramsey’s lack of originality, his
inability to see things afresh, as though he had come across the
problems for the first time. On 6 October, at the beginning of the
Michaelmas term, he recorded a dream that is a kind of allegory of his
situation, or at least of how he felt about his position:</p>
<p>This morning I dreamt: I had a long time ago commissioned someone to
make me a water-wheel and now I no longer wanted it but he was still
working on it.41 The wheel lay there and it was bad; it was notched all
around, perhaps in order to put the blades in (as in the motor of a
steam turbine). He explained to me what a tiresome task it was, and I
thought: I had ordered a straightforward paddle-wheel, which would have
been simple to make. The thought tormented me that the man was too
stupid to explain to him or to make a better wheel, and that I could do
nothing but leave him to it. I thought: I have to live with people to
whom I cannot make myself understood. – That is a thought that I
actually do have often. At the same time with the feeling that it is my
own fault.</p>
<p>‘The situation of the man, who so senselessly and badly worked on the
waterwheel’, he adds, ‘was my own in Manchester when I made what were,
with hindsight, fruitless attempts at the construction of a gas
turbine.’ But more than that, the dream is a picture of his present
intellectual situation now that the Tractatus had been proved
inadequate. There it lay: ineptly constructed and inadequate for the
task, and still the man (himself or Ramsey?) was tinkering with it,
performing the tiresome and pointless feat of making it still more
elaborate, when what was really needed was a completely different, and
simpler, kind of wheel.</p>
<p>In November Wittgenstein accepted an invitation from C. K. Ogden, the
translator of the Tractatus, to deliver a paper to ‘The Heretics’, a
society similar to the Apostles but less élitist and more concerned with
science. The society had previously been addressed by such luminaries as
H. G. Wells, Bertrand Russell and Virginia Woolf (Mr Bennett and Mrs
Brown is based on Virginia Woolf’s address to the Heretics). This time
he chose not to speak ‘Chinese’, but rather to use the opportunity to
try and correct the most prevalent and serious misunderstanding of the
Tractatus: the idea that it is a work written in a positivist,
anti-metaphysical spirit.</p>
<p>In what was to be the only ‘popular’ lecture he ever gave in his
life, Wittgenstein chose to speak on ethics. In it he reiterated the
view of the Tractatus that any attempt to say anything about the
subject-matter of ethics would lead to nonsense, but tried to make
clearer the fact that his own attitude to this was radically different
from that of a positivist anti-metaphysician:</p>
<p>My whole tendency and I believe the tendency of all men who ever
tried to write or talk on Ethics or Religion was to run against the
boundaries of language.42 This running against the walls of our cage is
perfectly, absolutely hopeless. Ethics so far as it springs from the
desire to say something about the meaning of life, the absolute good,
the absolute valuable, can be no science. What it says does not add to
our knowledge in any sense. But it is a document of a tendency in the
human mind which I personally cannot help respecting deeply and I would
not for my life ridicule it.</p>
<p>He also gave some examples from his own experience of this tendency
to ‘run against the walls of our cage’:</p>
<p>I will describe this experience in order, if possible, to make you
recall the same or similar experiences, so that we may have a common
ground for our investigation. I believe the best way of describing it is
to say that when I have it I wonder at the existence of the world. And I
am then inclined to use such phrases as ‘how extraordinary that anything
should exist’ or ‘how extraordinary that the world should exist’. I will
mention another experience straight away which I also know and which
others of you might be acquainted with: it is, what one might call, the
experience of feeling absolutely safe. I mean the state of mind in which
one is inclined to say ‘I am safe, nothing can injure me whatever
happens.’</p>
<p>He went on to show that the things one is inclined to say after such
experiences are a misuse of language – they mean nothing. And yet the
experiences themselves ‘seem to those who have had them, for instance to
me, to have in some sense an intrinsic, absolute value’. They cannot be
captured by factual language precisely because their value lies beyond
the world of facts. In a notebook of the time Wittgenstein wrote a
sentence which he did not include in the lecture, but which crystallizes
his attitude perfectly: ‘What is good is also divine.43 Queer as it
sounds, that sums up my ethics.’</p>
<p>What is perhaps most striking about this lecture, however, is that it
is not about ethics at all, as the term is usually understood. That is
to say, there is no mention in it of moral problems, or of how those
problems are to be analysed and understood. For Wittgenstein’s thoughts
on ethics in that sense, we have to turn to his diaries and the records
of his conversations.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that, though he regarded ethics as a realm in which
nothing was sayable, Wittgenstein did indeed think and say a great deal
about moral problems. In fact, his life might be said to have been
dominated by a moral struggle – the struggle to be anständig (decent),
which for him meant, above all, overcoming the temptations presented by
his pride and vanity to be dishonest.</p>
<p>It is not true, as some of his friends have insisted, that
Wittgenstein was so honest that he was incapable of telling a lie. Nor
is it true that he had no trace of the vanity of which he was always
accusing himself. Of course, to say this is not to claim that he was, by
ordinary standards, either dishonest or vain. He most certainly was not.
But there were, equally certainly, occasions on which his concern to
impress people overcame his concern to speak the strict truth. In his
diary he says of himself:</p>
<p>What others think of me always occupies me to an extraordinary
extent.44 I am often concerned to make a good impression. I.e. I very
frequently think about the impression I make on others and it is
pleasant if I think that it is good, and unpleasant if not.</p>
<p>And though, in stating this, he is only remarking on something that
is platitudinously true of all of us, yet he is also drawing attention
to what he felt to be the biggest barrier between himself and
Anständigkeit – namely, his vanity.</p>
<p>An impression Wittgenstein quite often made, and which no doubt
appealed to his vanity, was of being aristocratic. F. R. Leavis, for
example, once overheard him remark: ‘In my father’s house there were
seven grand pianos’, and immediately wondered whether he was related to
the Princess Wittgenstein who figures in the annals of music.45 It was,
in fact, widely believed in Cambridge that he was of the princely German
family, the Sayn-Wittgensteins. Though Wittgenstein did not positively
encourage this misapprehension, remarks such as the one quoted by Leavis
(which is, incidentally, of doubtful truth, there being only three or
four grand pianos at the house in the Alleegasse) would have done
nothing to correct it. Opinions vary as to what degree of concealment
there was about his true background. Perhaps the most important fact is
that Wittgenstein himself felt that he was hiding something – felt that
he was allowing people to think of him as an aristocrat when in fact he
was a Jew.fn1 In December he reported a complex dream, which might be
seen as an expression of this anxiety:</p>
<p>A strange dream:46</p>
<p>I see in an illustrated newspaper a photograph of Vertsagt, who is a
much talked about hero of the day. The picture shows him in his car.
People talk about his disgraceful deeds; Hänsel is standing next to me
and also someone else, someone who resembles my brother Kurt. The latter
says that Vertsag [sic] is a Jew but has enjoyed the upbringing of a
rich Scottish Lord. Now he is a workers’ leader (Arbeiterführer). He has
not changed his name because it is not the custom there. It is new to me
that Vertsagt, which I pronounce with the stress on the first syllable,
is a Jew, and I see that his name is simply verzagt [German for
‘faint-hearted’]. It doesn’t strike me that it is written with ‘ts’
which I see printed a little bolder than the other letters. I think:
must there be a Jew behind every indecency? Now Hänsel and I are on the
terrace of a house, perhaps the big log-cabin on the Hochreit, and along
the street comes Vertsag in his motorcar; he has an angry face, slightly
reddish fair hair and a similarly coloured moustache (he does not look
Jewish). He opens fire with a machine-gun at a cyclist behind him who
writhes with pain and is mercilessly gunned to the ground with several
shots. Vertsag has driven past, and now comes a young, poor-looking girl
on a cycle and she too is shot at by Vertsag as he drives on. And these
shots, when they hit her breast make a bubbling sound like an
almost-empty kettle over a flame. I felt sorry for the girl and thought
that it could only happen in Austria that this girl would find no help
and compassion; that the people would look on as she suffers and is
killed. I myself am afraid to help her because I am afraid of being shot
by Vertsag. I go towards her, but try and hide behind a board.</p>
<p>Then I wake up. I must add that in the conversation with Hänsel,
first in the presence of the other person and then after he had left us,
I am embarrassed and do not want to say that I myself am descended from
Jews or that the case of Vertsag is my own case too.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s waking reflections on the dream have to do mostly with
the name of its central character. He thought, strangely, that it was
spelt pferzagt (which means nothing) and also that it was Hungarian:
‘The name had for me something evil, spiteful and very masculine about
it.’</p>
<p>But more pertinent perhaps is his very first thought: that the case
of Vertsagt is also his own – that of a man who is regarded as a hero
and has the looks and upbringing of an aristocrat, but is actually a Jew
and a scoundrel. And, what is worse, that he felt too embarrassed, too
verzagt, to confess it. This feeling of cowardice haunted him for many
years, and led him eventually, seven years after this dream, to make a
formal confession of the extent of his Jewish background.</p>
<p>What is most disturbing about the dream, however, is Wittgenstein’s
use of Nazi slogans to express his own internal anxieties. Is a Jew
behind every indecency? The question might have come out of Mein Kampf,
so redolent is it of the Nazi picture of the deceitful, parasitic Jew
hiding his real intentions and his real nature as he spreads his poison
among the German peoples. Thankfully, the period during which
Wittgenstein was inclined to adopt this image (or something not so very
different from it) to describe and analyse his own Unanständigkeit is
mercifully brief. It reaches its climax in a series of remarks about
Jewishness written in 1931, and after that comes abruptly to an end.</p>
<p>One question which naturally arises out of the dream is not discussed
by Wittgenstein: is Vertsagt’s shooting of the innocent girl a symbol of
his own corrupting influence on Marguerite? There is, of course, no way
of answering the question, but there are, I think, reasons for thinking
that his plans to marry Marguerite prompted him to make yet deeper and
more strenuous efforts to cleanse himself of his own impurities, to
unearth all the unpleasant and dishonest sides to his nature that he
preferred to keep hidden, in readiness for his commitment to the
‘sacred’ act he mentioned to Lettice Ramsey.</p>
<p>fn1 Bartley claims that Wittgenstein once pleaded with a cousin who
was living in England not to reveal his partly Jewish descent, while
most of his friends insist he did nothing at all to hide the truth about
his origins.</p>
