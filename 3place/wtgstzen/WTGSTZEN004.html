<h4 id="the-laboratory-for-self-destruction">1 THE LABORATORY FOR
SELF-DESTRUCTION</h4>
<p>WHY SHOULD ONE tell the truth if it’s to one’s advantage to tell a
lie?’1</p>
<p>Such was the subject of Ludwig Wittgenstein’s earliest recorded
philosophical reflections. Aged about eight or nine, he paused in a
doorway to consider the question. Finding no satisfactory answer, he
concluded that there was, after all, nothing wrong with lying under such
circumstances. In later life, he described the event as, ‘an experience
which if not decisive for my future way of life was at any rate
characteristic of my nature at that time’.</p>
<p>In one respect the episode is characteristic of his entire life.
Unlike, say, Bertrand Russell, who turned to philosophy with hope of
finding certainty where previously he had felt only doubt, Wittgenstein
was drawn to it by a compulsive tendency to be struck by such questions.
Philosophy, one might say, came to him, not he to philosophy. Its
dilemmas were experienced by him as unwelcome intrusions, enigmas, which
forced themselves upon him and held him captive, unable to get on with
everyday life until he could dispel them with a satisfactory
solution.</p>
<p>Yet Wittgenstein’s youthful answer to this particular problem is, in
another sense, deeply uncharacteristic. Its easy acceptance of
dishonesty is fundamentally incompatible with the relentless
truthfulness for which Wittgenstein was both admired and feared as an
adult. It is incompatible also, perhaps, with his very sense of being a
philosopher. ‘Call me a truth-seeker’, he once wrote to his sister (who
had, in a letter to him, called him a great philosopher), ’and I will be
satisfied.’2</p>
<p>This points not to a change of opinion, but to a change of character
– the first of many in a life that is marked by a series of such
transformations, undertaken at moments of crisis and pursued with a
conviction that the source of the crisis was himself. It is as though
his life was an ongoing battle with his own nature. In so far as he
achieved anything, it was usually with the sense of its being in spite
of his nature. The ultimate achievement, in this sense, would be the
complete overcoming of himself – a transformation that would make
philosophy itself unnecessary.</p>
<p>In later life, when someone once remarked to him that the childlike
innocence of G. E. Moore was to his credit, Wittgenstein demurred. ‘I
can’t understand that’, he said, ‘unless it’s also to a child’s credit.3
For you aren’t talking of the innocence a man has fought for, but of an
innocence which comes from a natural absence of a temptation.’</p>
<p>The remark hints at a self-assessment. Wittgenstein’s own character –
the compelling, uncompromising, dominating personality recalled in the
many memoirs of him written by his friends and students – was something
he had had to fight for. As a child he had a sweet and compliant
disposition – eager to please, willing to conform, and, as we have seen,
prepared to compromise the truth. The story of the first eighteen years
of his life is, above all, the story of this struggle, of the forces
within him and outside him that impelled such transformation.</p>
<p>He was born – Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein – on 26 April 1889,
the eighth and youngest child of one of the wealthiest families in
Habsburg Vienna. The family’s name and their wealth have led some to
suppose that he was related to a German aristocratic family, the
Seyn-Wittgensteins. This is not so. The family had been Wittgensteins
for only three generations. The name was adopted by Ludwig’s paternal
great-grandfather, Moses Maier, who worked as a land-agent for the
princely family, and who, after the Napoleonic decree of 1808 which
demanded that Jews adopt a surname, took on the name of his
employers.</p>
<p>Within the family a legend grew up that Moses Maier’s son, Hermann
Christian Wittgenstein, was the illegitimate offspring of a prince
(whether of the house of Wittgenstein, Waldeck or Esterházy depends on
the version of the story), but there are no solid grounds for believing
this. The truth of the story seems all the more doubtful, since it
appears to date from a time when the family was attempting
(successfully, as we shall see later) to have itself reclassified under
the Nuremberg Laws.</p>
<p>The story would no doubt have suited Hermann Wittgenstein himself,
who adopted the middle name ‘Christian’ in a deliberate attempt to
dissociate himself from his Jewish background. He cut himself off
entirely from the Jewish community into which he was born and left his
birthplace of Korbach to live in Leipzig, where he pursued a successful
career as a wool-merchant, buying from Hungary and Poland and selling to
England and Holland. He chose as his wife the daughter of an eminent
Viennese Jewish family, Fanny Figdor, but before their wedding in 1838
she too had converted to Protestantism.</p>
<p>By the time they moved to Vienna in the 1850s the Wittgensteins
probably no longer regarded themselves as Jewish. Hermann Christian,
indeed, acquired something of a reputation as an anti-Semite, and firmly
forbade his offspring to marry Jews. The family was large – eight
daughters and three sons – and on the whole they heeded their father’s
advice and married into the ranks of the Viennese Protestant
professional classes. Thus was established a network of judges, lawyers,
professors and clergymen which the Wittgensteins could rely on if they
needed the services of any of the traditional professions. So complete
was the family’s assimilation that one of Hermann’s daughters had to ask
her brother Louis if the rumours she had heard about their Jewish
origins were true. ‘Pur sang, Milly’, he replied, ‘pur sang.’</p>
<p>The situation was not unlike that of many other notable Viennese
families: no matter how integrated they were into the Viennese middle
class, and no matter how divorced from their origins, they yet remained
– in some mysterious way – Jewish ‘through and through’.</p>
<p>The Wittgensteins (unlike, say, the Freuds) were in no way part of a
Jewish community – except in the elusive but important sense in which
the whole of Vienna could be so described; nor did Judaism play any part
in their upbringing. Their culture was entirely Germanic. Fanny
Wittgenstein came from a merchant family which had close connections
with the cultural life of Austria. They were friends of the poet Franz
Grillparzer and known to the artists of Austria as enthusiastic and
discriminating collectors. One of her cousins was the famous violin
virtuoso, Joseph Joachim, in whose development she and Hermann played a
decisive role. He was adopted by them at the age of twelve and sent to
study with Felix Mendelssohn. When the composer asked what he should
teach the boy, Hermann Wittgenstein replied: ‘Just let him breathe the
air you breathe!’</p>
<p>Through Joachim, the family was introduced to Johannes Brahms, whose
friendship they prized above any other. Brahms gave piano lessons to the
daughters of Hermann and Fanny, and was later a regular attender at the
musical evenings given by the Wittgensteins. At least one of his major
works – the Clarinet Quintet – received its first performance at the
Wittgenstein home.</p>
<p>Such was the air the Wittgensteins breathed – an atmosphere of
cultural attainment and comfortable respectability, tainted only by the
bad odour of anti-Semitism, the merest sniff of which was sufficient to
keep them forever reminded of their ‘non-Aryan’ origins.</p>
<p>His grandfather’s remark to Mendelssohn was to be echoed many years
later by Ludwig Wittgenstein when he urged one of his students at
Cambridge, Maurice Drury, to leave the university. ‘There is’, he told
him, ‘no oxygen in Cambridge for you.’4 Drury, he thought, would be
better off getting a job among the working class, where the air was
healthier. With regard to himself – to his own decision to stay at
Cambridge – the metaphor received an interesting twist: ‘It doesn’t
matter for me’, he told Drury. ‘I manufacture my own oxygen.’</p>
<p>His father, Karl Wittgenstein, had shown a similar independence from
the atmosphere in which he was brought up, and the same determination to
manufacture his own. Karl was the exception among the children of
Hermann and Fanny – the only one whose life was not determined by their
aspirations. He was a difficult child, who from an early age rebelled
against the formality and authoritarianism of his parents and resisted
their attempts to provide him with the kind of classical education
appropriate to a member of the Viennese bourgeoisie.</p>
<p>At the age of eleven he tried to run away from home. At seventeen he
got himself expelled from school by writing an essay denying the
immortality of the soul. Hermann persevered. He tried to continue Karl’s
education at home by employing private tutors to see him through his
exams. But Karl ran off again, and this time succeeded in getting away.
After hiding out in the centre of Vienna for a couple of months, he fled
to New York, arriving there penniless and carrying little more than his
violin. He managed nevertheless to maintain himself for over two years
by working as a waiter, a saloon musician, a bartender and a teacher (of
the violin, the horn, mathematics, German and anything else he could
think of). The adventure served to establish that he was his own master,
and when he returned to Vienna in 1867 he was allowed – indeed,
encouraged – to pursue his practical and technical bent, and to study
engineering rather than follow his father and his brothers into estate
management.</p>
<p>After a year at the technical high school in Vienna and an
apprenticeship consisting of a series of jobs with various engineering
firms, Karl was offered the post of draughtsman on the construction of a
rolling mill in Bohemia by Paul Kupelwieser, the brother of his
brother-in-law. This was Karl’s great opportunity. His subsequent rise
within the company was so astonishingly swift that within five years he
had succeeded Kupelwieser as managing director. In the ten years that
followed he showed himself to be perhaps the most astute industrialist
in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The fortunes of his company – and, of
course, his own personal fortune – increased manifold, so that by the
last decade of the nineteenth century he had become one of the
wealthiest men in the empire, and the leading figure in its iron and
steel industry. As such, he became, for critics of the excesses of
capitalism, one of the archetypes of the aggressively acquisitive
industrialist. Through him the Wittgensteins became the Austrian
equivalent of the Krupps, the Carnegies, or the Rothschilds.</p>
<p>In 1898, having amassed a huge personal fortune which to this day
provides comfortably for his descendants, Karl Wittgenstein suddenly
retired from business, resigning from the boards of all the steel
companies he had presided over and transferring his investments to
foreign – principally US – equities. (This last act proved to be
remarkably prescient, securing the family fortune against the inflation
that crippled Austria after the First World War.) He was by this time
the father of eight extraordinarily talented children.</p>
<p>The mother of Karl Wittgenstein’s children was Leopoldine Kalmus,
whom Karl had married in 1873, at the beginning of his dramatic rise
through the Kupelwieser company. In choosing her, Karl was once again
proving to be the exception in his family, for Leopoldine was the only
partly Jewish spouse of any of the children of Hermann Christian.
However, although her father, Jakob Kalmus, was descended from a
prominent Jewish family, he himself had been brought up a Catholic; her
mother, Marie Stallner, was entirely ‘Aryan’ – the daughter of an
established (Catholic) Austrian land-owning family. In fact, then (until
the Nuremberg Laws were applied in Austria, at least), Karl had not
married a Jewess, but a Catholic, and had thus taken a further step in
the assimilation of the Wittgenstein family into the Viennese
establishment.</p>
<p>The eight children of Karl and Leopoldine Wittgenstein were baptized
into the Catholic faith and raised as accepted and proud members of the
Austrian high-bourgeoisie. Karl Wittgenstein was even given the chance
of joining the ranks of the nobility, but declined the invitation to add
the aristocratic ‘Von’ to his name, feeling that such a gesture would be
seen as the mark of the parvenu.</p>
<p>His immense wealth nevertheless enabled the family to live in the
style of the aristocracy. Their home in Vienna, in the ‘Alleegasse’ (now
Argentinergasse), was known outside the family as the Palais
Wittgenstein, and was indeed palatial, having been built for a count
earlier in the century. In addition to this, the family owned another
house, in the Neuwaldeggergasse, on the outskirts of Vienna, and a large
estate in the country, the Hochreit, to which they retired during the
summer.</p>
<p>Leopoldine (or ‘Poldy’ as she was known to the family) was, even when
judged by the very highest standards, exceptionally musical. For her,
music came second only to the well-being of her husband, as the most
important thing in her life. It was owing to her that the Alleegasse
house became a centre of musical excellence. Musical evenings there were
attended by, among others, Brahms, Mahler and Bruno Walter, who has
described ‘the all-pervading atmosphere of humanity and culture’ which
prevailed. The blind organist and composer Josef Labor owed his career
largely to the patronage of the Wittgenstein family, who held him in
enormously high regard. In later life Ludwig Wittgenstein was fond of
saying that there had been just six great composers: Haydn, Mozart,
Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms – and Labor.</p>
<p>After his retirement from industry Karl Wittgenstein became known
also as a great patron of the visual arts. Aided by his eldest daughter,
Hermine – herself a gifted painter – he assembled a noteworthy
collection of valuable paintings and sculptures, including works by
Klimt, Moser and Rodin. Klimt called him his ‘Minister of Fine Art’, in
gratitude for his financing of both the Secession Building (at which the
works of Klimt, Schiele and Kokoschka were exhibited), and Klimt’s own
mural, Philosophie, which had been rejected by the University of Vienna.
When Ludwig’s sister, Margarete Wittgenstein, married in 1905, Klimt was
commissioned to paint her wedding portrait.</p>
<p>The Wittgensteins were thus at the centre of Viennese cultural life
during what was, if not its most glorious era, at least its most
dynamic. The period of cultural history in Vienna from the late
nineteenth century to the outbreak of the First World War has, quite
justifiably, been the centre of much interest in recent years. It has
been described as a time of ‘nervous splendour’, a phrase which might
also be used to characterize the environment in which the children of
Karl and Poldy were raised. For just as in the city at large, so within
the family, beneath the ‘all-pervading atmosphere of culture and
humanity’, lay doubt, tension and conflict.</p>
<p>The fascination of fin de siècle Vienna for the present-day lies in
the fact that its tensions prefigure those that have dominated the
history of Europe during the twentieth century. From those tensions
sprang many of the intellectual and cultural movements that have shaped
that history. It was, in an oft-quoted phrase of Karl Kraus, the
‘research laboratory for world destruction’ – the birthplace of both
Zionism and Nazism, the place where Freud developed psychoanalysis,
where Klimt, Schiele and Kokoschka inaugurated the Jugendstil movement
in art, where Schoenberg developed atonal music and Adolf Loos
introduced the starkly functional, unadorned style of architecture that
characterizes the buildings of the modern age. In almost every field of
human thought and activity, the new was emerging from the old, the
twentieth century from the nineteenth.</p>
<p>That this should happen in Vienna is especially remarkable, since it
was the centre of an empire that had, in many ways, not yet emerged from
the eighteenth century. The anachronistic nature of this empire was
symbolized by its aged ruler. Franz Josef, Emperor of Austria since 1848
and King of Hungary since 1867, was to remain both kaiserlich and
königlich until 1916, after which the ramshackle conglomeration of
kingdoms and principalities that had formed the Habsburg Empire soon
collapsed, its territory to be divided between the nation states of
Austria, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Italy. The
nineteenth-century movements of nationalism and democracy had made its
collapse inevitable a long time before that, and for the last fifty or
so years of its existence the empire survived by teetering from one
crisis to the next, its continuing survival believed in only by those
who turned a blind eye to the oncoming tides. For those who wished it to
survive, the political situation was always ‘desperate, but not
serious’.</p>
<p>The emergence of radical innovation in such a state is not, perhaps,
such a paradox: where the old is in such transparent decay, the new has
to emerge. The empire was a home for genius, after all, as Robert Musil
once famously observed: ‘and that, probably, was the ruin of it’.</p>
<p>What divided the intellectuals of Jung Wien from their forebears was
their recognition of the decay around them, a refusal to pretend that
things could go on as they always had. Schoenberg’s atonal system was
founded on the conviction that the old system of composition had run its
course; Adolf Loos’s rejection of ornament on the recognition that the
baroque adornments to buildings had become an empty shell, signifying
nothing; Freud’s postulation of unconscious forces on the perception
that beneath the conventions and mores of society something very real
and important was being repressed and denied.</p>
<p>In the Wittgenstein family this generational difference was played
out in a way that only partly mirrors the wider dissonance. Karl
Wittgenstein, after all, was not a representative of the Habsburg old
order. Indeed, he represented a force that had curiously little impact
on the life of Austria-Hungary – that of the metaphysically
materialistic, politically liberal and aggressively capitalistic
entrepreneur. In England, Germany or – especially, perhaps – in America,
he would have been seen as a man of his times. In Austria he remained
outside the mainstream. After his retirement from business he published
a series of articles in the Neue Freie Presse extolling the virtues of
American free enterprise, but in doing so he was addressing an issue
that had only a marginal place in Austrian politics.</p>
<p>The absence of an effective liberal tradition in Austria was one of
the chief factors that set its political history apart from that of
other European nations. Its politics were dominated – and continued to
be so until the rise of Hitler – by the struggle between the Catholicism
of the Christian Socialists and the socialism of the Social Democrats. A
side-show to this main conflict was provided by the opposition to both
parties – who each in their different ways wished to maintain the
supra-national character of the empire – of the pan-German movement led
by Georg von Schoenerer, which espoused the kind of anti-Semitic,
Volkisch, nationalism that the Nazis would later make their own.</p>
<p>Being neither members of the old guard, nor socialists – and
certainly not pan-German nationalists – the Wittgensteins had little to
contribute to the politics of their country. And yet the values that had
made Karl Wittgenstein a successful industrialist were, in another way,
the focus of a generational conflict that resonates with the wider
tensions of the age. As a successful industrialist, Karl was content to
acquire culture; his children, and especially his sons, were intent on
contributing to it.</p>
<p>Fifteen years separated Karl’s eldest child, Hermine, from his
youngest, Ludwig, and his eight children might be divided into two
distinct generations: Hermine, Hans, Kurt and Rudolf as the older;
Margarete, Helene, Paul and Ludwig the younger. By the time the two
youngest boys reached adolescence, the conflict between Karl and his
first generation of children had dictated that Paul and Ludwig grew up
under quite a different régime.</p>
<p>The régime within which Karl’s eldest sons were raised was shaped by
Karl’s determination to see them continue his business. They were not to
be sent to schools (where they would acquire the bad habits of mind of
the Austrian establishment), but were to be educated privately in a way
designed to train their minds for the intellectual rigours of commerce.
They were then to be sent to some part of the Wittgenstein business
empire, where they would acquire the technical and commercial expertise
necessary for success in industry.</p>
<p>With only one of his sons did this have anything like the desired
effect. Kurt, by common consent the least gifted of the children,
acquiesced in his father’s wishes and became in time a company director.
His suicide, unlike that of his brothers, was not obviously related to
the parental pressure exerted by his father. It came much later, at the
end of the First World War, when he shot himself after the troops under
his command had refused to obey orders.</p>
<p>On Hans and Rudolf, the effect of Karl’s pressure was disastrous.
Neither had the slightest inclination to become captains of industry.
With encouragement and support, Hans might have become a great composer,
or at the very least a successful concert musician. Even by the
Wittgenstein family – most of whom had considerable musical ability – he
was regarded as exceptionally gifted. He was a musical prodigy of
Mozartian talents – a genius. While still in infancy he mastered the
violin and piano, and at the age of four he began composing his own
work. Music for him was not an interest but an all-consuming passion; it
had to be at the centre, not the periphery, of his life. Faced with his
father’s insistence that he pursue a career in industry, he did what his
father had done before him and ran away to America. His intention was to
seek a life as a musician. What exactly happened to him nobody knows. In
1903 the family were informed that a year earlier he had disappeared
from a boat in Chesapeake Bay, and had not been seen since. The obvious
conclusion to draw was that he had committed suicide.</p>
<p>Would Hans have lived a happy life had he been free to devote himself
to a musical career? Would he have been better prepared to face life
outside the rarefied atmosphere of the Wittgenstein home if he had
attended school? Obviously, nobody knows. But Karl was sufficiently
shaken by the news to change his methods for his two youngest boys, Paul
and Ludwig, who were sent to school and allowed to pursue their own
bent.</p>
<p>For Rudolf, the change came too late. He was already in his twenties
when Hans went missing, and had himself embarked upon a similar course.
He, too, had rebelled against his father’s wishes, and by 1903 was
living in Berlin, where he had gone to seek a career in the theatre. His
suicide in 1904 was reported in a local newspaper. One evening in May,
according to the report, Rudolf had walked into a pub in Berlin and
ordered two drinks. After sitting by himself for a while, he ordered a
drink for the piano player and asked him to play his favourite song, ‘I
am lost’. As the music played, Rudi took cyanide and collapsed. In a
farewell letter to his family he said that he had killed himself because
a friend of his had died. In another farewell letter he said it was
because he had ‘doubts about his perverted disposition’. Some time
before his death he had approached ‘The Scientific-Humanitarian
Committee’ (which campaigned for the emancipation of homosexuals) for
help, but, says the yearbook of the organization, ‘our influence did not
reach far enough to turn him away from the fate of
self-destruction’.5</p>
<p>Until the suicides of his two brothers, Ludwig showed none of the
self-destructiveness epidemic among the Wittgensteins of his generation.
For much of his childhood, he was considered one of the dullest of this
extraordinary brood. He exhibited no precocious musical, artistic or
literary talent, and, indeed, did not even start speaking until he was
four years old. Lacking the rebelliousness and wilfulness that marked
the other male members of his family, he dedicated himself from an early
age to the kind of practical skills and technical interests his father
had tried unsuccessfully to inculcate into his elder brothers. One of
the earliest photographs of him to survive shows a rather earnest young
boy, working with apparent relish at his own lathe. If he revealed no
particular genius, he at least showed application and some considerable
manual dexterity. At the age of ten, for example, he constructed a
working model of a sewing machine out of bits of wood and wire.</p>
<p>Until he was fourteen, he was content to feel himself surrounded by
genius, rather than possessed of it. A story he told in later life
concerned an occasion when he was woken at three in the morning by the
sound of a piano. He went downstairs to find Hans performing one of his
own compositions.6 Hans’s concentration was manic. He was sweating,
totally absorbed, and completely oblivious of Ludwig’s presence. The
image remained for Ludwig a paradigm of what it was like to be possessed
of genius.</p>
<p>The extent to which the Wittgensteins venerated music is perhaps hard
for us to appreciate today. Certainly there is no modern equivalent of
the form this veneration took, so intimately connected was it with the
Viennese classical tradition. Ludwig’s own musical tastes – which were,
as far as we can judge, typical of his family – struck many of his later
Cambridge contemporaries as deeply reactionary. He would tolerate
nothing later than Brahms, and even in Brahms, he once said, ‘I can
begin to hear the sound of machinery.’ The true ‘sons of God’ were
Mozart and Beethoven.7</p>
<p>The standards of musicality that prevailed in the family were truly
extraordinary. Paul, the brother closest in age to Ludwig, was to become
a very successful and well-known concert pianist. In the First World War
he lost his right arm, but, with remarkable determination, taught
himself to play using only his left hand, and attained such proficiency
that he was able to continue his concert career. It was for him that
Ravel, in 1931, wrote his famous Concerto for the Left Hand. And yet,
though admired throughout the world, Paul’s playing was not admired
within his own family. It lacked taste, they thought; it was too full of
extravagant gestures. More to their taste was the refined, classically
understated playing of Ludwig’s sister Helene. Their mother, Poldy, was
an especially stern critic. Gretl, probably the least musical of the
family, once gamely attempted a duet with her, but before they had got
very far Poldy suddenly broke off. ‘Du hast aber keinen Rhythmus!’ (‘You
have no sense of rhythm at all!’) she shrieked.8</p>
<p>This intolerance of second-rate playing possibly deterred the nervous
Ludwig from even attempting to master a musical instrument until he was
in his thirties, when he learnt to play the clarinet as part of his
training to be a teacher. As a child he made himself admired and loved
in other ways – through his unerring politeness, his sensitivity to
others, and his willingness to oblige. He was, in any case, secure in
the knowledge that, so long as he showed an interest in engineering, he
could always rely on the encouragement and approval of his father.</p>
<p>Though he later emphasized the unhappiness of his childhood, he gave
the impression to the rest of his family of being a contented, cheerful
boy. This discrepancy surely forms the crux of his boyhood reflections
on honesty quoted earlier. The dishonesty he had in mind was not the
petty kind that, say, allows one to steal something and then deny it,
but the more subtle kind that consists in, for example, saying something
because it is expected rather than because it is true. It was in part
his willingness to succumb to this form of dishonesty that distinguished
him from his siblings. So, at least, he thought in later life. An
example that remained in his memory was of his brother Paul, ill in bed.
On being asked whether he would like to get up or to stay longer in bed,
Paul replied calmly that he would rather stay in bed. ‘Whereas I in the
same circumstances’, Ludwig recalled, ’said what was untrue (that I
wanted to get up) because I was afraid of the bad opinion of those
around me.’9</p>
<p>Sensitivity to the bad opinion of others lies at the heart of another
example that stayed in his memory. He and Paul had wanted to belong to a
Viennese gymnastic club, but discovered that (like most such clubs at
that time) it was restricted to those of ‘Aryan’ origin. He was prepared
to lie about their Jewish background in order to gain acceptance; Paul
was not.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the question was not whether one should, on all
occasions, tell the truth, but rather whether one had an overriding
obligation to be true – whether, despite the pressures to do otherwise,
one should insist on being oneself. In Paul’s case, this problem was
made easier following Karl’s change of heart after the death of Hans. He
was sent to grammar school, and spent the rest of his life pursuing the
musical career that was his natural bent. In Ludwig’s case, the
situation was more complicated. The pressures on him to conform to the
wishes of others had become as much internal as external. Under the
weight of these pressures, he allowed people to think that his natural
bent was in the technical subjects that would train him for his father’s
preferred occupation. Privately he regarded himself as having ‘neither
taste nor talent’ for engineering; quite reasonably, under the
circumstances, his family considered him to have both.</p>
<p>Accordingly, Ludwig was sent, not to the grammar school in Vienna
that Paul attended, but to the more technical and less academic
Realschule in Linz. It was, it is true, feared that he would not pass
the rigorous entrance examinations set by a grammar school, but the
primary consideration was the feeling that a more technical education
would suit his interests better.</p>
<p>The Realschule at Linz, however, has not gone down in history as a
promising training ground for future engineers and industrialists. If it
is famous for anything, it is for being the seedbed of Adolf Hitler’s
Weltanschauung. Hitler was, in fact, a contemporary of Wittgenstein’s
there, and (if Mein Kampf can be believed) it was the history teacher at
the school, Leopold Pötsch, who first taught him to see the Habsburg
Empire as a ‘degenerate dynasty’ and to distinguish the hopeless
dynastic patriotism of those loyal to the Habsburgs from the (to Hitler)
more appealing Völkisch nationalism of the pan-German movement. Hitler,
though almost exactly the same age as Wittgenstein, was two years behind
at school. They overlapped at the school for only the year 1904–5,
before Hitler was forced to leave because of his poor record. There is
no evidence that they had anything to do with one another.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein spent three years at the school, from 1903 to 1906. His
school reports survive, and show him to have been, on the whole, a
fairly poor student. If one translates the five subject-grades used in
the school into a scale from A to E, then he achieved an A only twice in
his school career – both times in religious studies. In most subjects he
was graded C or D, rising to a B every now and again in English and
natural history, and sinking to an E on one occasion in chemistry. If
there is a pattern to his results, it is that he was, if anything,
weaker in the scientific and technical subjects than in the
humanities.</p>
<p>His poor results may in part be due to his unhappiness at school. It
was the first time in his life he had lived away from the privileged
environment of his family home, and he did not find it easy to find
friends among his predominantly working-class fellow pupils. On first
setting eyes on them he was shocked by their uncouth behaviour. ‘Mist!’
(‘Muck!’) was his initial impression. To them he seemed (as one of them
later told his sister Hermine) like a being from another world. He
insisted on using the polite form ‘Sie’ to address them, which served
only to alienate him further. They ridiculed him by chanting an
alliterative jingle that made play of his unhappiness and of the
distance between him and the rest of the school: ‘Wittgenstein wandelt
wehmütig widriger Winde wegen Wienwärts’ (‘Wittgenstein wends his woeful
windy way towards Vienna’).10 In his efforts to make friends, he felt,
he later said, ‘betrayed and sold’ by his schoolmates.</p>
<p>His one close friend at Linz was a boy called Pepi, the son of the
Strigl family, with whom he lodged. Throughout his three years at the
school, he experienced with Pepi the love and hurt, the breaks and
reconciliations, typical of adolescent attachment.</p>
<p>The effect of this relationship, and of his difficulties with his
classmates, seems to have been to intensify the questioning and doubting
nature implicit in his earlier reflections. His high marks in religious
knowledge are a reflection, not only of the comparative leniency of
priests compared with school teachers, but also of his own growing
preoccupation with fundamental questions. His intellectual development
during his time at Linz owed far more to the impetus of these doubts
than to anything he may have been taught at school.</p>
<p>The biggest intellectual influence on him at this time was not that
of any of his teachers, but that of his elder sister Margarete
(‘Gretl’). Gretl was acknowledged as the intellectual of the family, the
one who kept abreast of contemporary developments in the arts and
sciences, and the one most prepared to embrace new ideas and to
challenge the views of her elders. She was an early defender of Freud,
and was herself psychoanalysed by him. She later became a close friend
of his and had a hand in his (perilously late) escape from the Nazis
after the Anschluss.</p>
<p>It was no doubt through Gretl that Wittgenstein first became aware of
the work of Karl Kraus. Kraus’s satirical journal Die Fackel (‘The
Torch’) first appeared in 1899, and from the very beginning was a huge
success among the intellectually disaffected in Vienna. It was read by
everyone with any pretence to understanding the political and cultural
trends of the time, and exerted an enormous influence on practically all
the major figures mentioned previously, from Adolf Loos to Oskar
Kokoschka. From the first, Gretl was an enthusiastic reader of Kraus’s
journal and a strong sympathizer of almost everything he represented.
(Given the protean nature of Kraus’s views, it was more or less
impossible to sympathize with quite everything he said.)</p>
<p>Before founding Die Fackel, Kraus was known chiefly as the author of
an anti-Zionist tract entitled Eine Krone für Zion (‘A Crown for Zion’),
which mocked the views of Theodor Herzl for being reactionary and
divisive. Freedom for the Jews, Kraus maintained, could come only from
their complete assimilation.</p>
<p>Kraus was a member of the Social Democrat Party, and for the first
few years of its publication (until about 1904) his journal was regarded
as a mouthpiece for socialist ideas. The targets of his satire were, to
a large extent, those a socialist might like to see hit. He attacked the
hypocrisy of the Austrian government in its treatment of the Balkan
peoples, the nationalism of the pan-German movement, the laissez-faire
economic policies advocated by the Neue Freie Presse (in, for example,
Karl Wittgenstein’s articles for the paper), and the corruption of the
Viennese Press in its willingness to serve the interests of the
government and of big business. He led an especially passionate campaign
against the sexual hypocrisy of the Austrian establishment, as
manifested in the legal persecution of prostitutes and the social
condemnation of homosexuals. ‘A trial involving sexual morality’, he
said, ’is a deliberate step from individual to general
immorality.’11</p>
<p>From 1904 onward, the nature of his attacks became less political
than moral. Behind his satire was a concern with spiritual values that
was alien to the ideology of the Austro-Marxists. He was concerned to
uncover hypocrisy and injustice, not primarily from a desire to protect
the interests of the proletariat, but rather from the point of view of
one who sought to protect the integrity of an essentially aristocratic
ideal of the nobility of truth. He was criticized for this by his
friends on the Left, one of whom, Robert Scheu, told him bluntly that
the choice before him was that of supporting the decaying old order or
supporting the Left. ‘If I must choose the lesser of two evils’, came
Kraus’s lofty reply, ‘I will choose neither.’12 Politics, he said, ‘is
what a man does in order to conceal what he is and what he himself does
not know’.13</p>
<p>The phrase encapsulates one of the many ways in which the outlook of
the adult Wittgenstein corresponds to that of Kraus. ‘Just improve
yourself’, Wittgenstein would later say to many of his friends, ‘that is
all you can do to improve the world.’ Political questions, for him,
would always be secondary to questions of personal integrity. The
question he had asked himself at the age of eight was answered by a kind
of Kantian categorical imperative: one should be truthful, and that is
that; the question ‘Why?’ is inappropriate and cannot be answered.
Rather, all other questions must be asked and answered within this fixed
point – the inviolable duty to be true to oneself.</p>
<p>The determination not to conceal ‘what one is’ became central to
Wittgenstein’s whole outlook. It was the driving force that impelled the
series of confessions he was to make later in life of the times when he
had failed to be honest. During his time at school in Linz, he made the
first of these attempts to come clean about himself, when he made some
confessions to his eldest sister, Hermine (‘Mining’). What formed the
subject of these confessions, we do not know; we know only that he was
later disparaging about them. He described them as confessions ‘in which
I manage to appear to be an excellent human being’.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s loss of religious faith, which, he later said,
occurred while he was a schoolboy at Linz, was, one supposes, a
consequence of this spirit of stark truthfulness. In other words, it was
not so much that he lost his faith as that he now felt obliged to
acknowledge that he had none, to confess that he could not believe the
things a Christian was supposed to believe. This may have been one of
the things he confessed to Mining. Certainly he discussed it with Gretl,
who, to help him in the philosophical reflection consequent on a loss of
faith, directed him to the work of Schopenhauer.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer’s transcendental idealism, as expressed in his classic,
The World as Will and Representation, formed the basis of Wittgenstein’s
earliest philosophy. The book is, in many ways, one that is bound to
appeal to an adolescent who has lost his religious faith and is looking
for something to replace it. For while Schopenhauer recognizes ‘man’s
need for metaphysics’, he insists that it is neither necessary nor
possible for an intelligent honest person to believe in the literal
truth of religious doctrines. To expect that he should, Schopenhauer
says, would be like asking a giant to put on the shoes of a dwarf.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer’s own metaphysics is a peculiar adaptation of Kant’s.
Like Kant, he regards the everyday world, the world of the senses, as
mere appearance, but unlike Kant (who insists that noumenal reality is
unknowable), he identifies as the only true reality the world of the
ethical will. It is a theory that provides a metaphysical counterpart to
the attitude of Karl Kraus mentioned earlier – a philosophical
justification of the view that what happens in the ‘outside’ world is
less important than the existential, ‘internal’ question of ‘what one
is’. Schopenhauer’s idealism was abandoned by Wittgenstein only when he
began to study logic and was persuaded to adopt Frege’s conceptual
realism. Even after that, however, he returned to Schopenhauer at a
critical stage in the composition of the Tractatus, when he believed
that he had reached a point where idealism and realism coincide.fn1</p>
<p>Taken to its extreme, the view that the ‘internal’ has priority over
the ‘external’ becomes solipsism, the denial that there is any reality
outside oneself. Much of Wittgenstein’s later philosophical thinking
about the self is an attempt once and for all to put to rest the ghost
of this view. Among the books that he read as a schoolboy which
influenced his later development, this doctrine finds its most startling
expression in Sex and Character, by Otto Weininger.</p>
<p>It was during Wittgenstein’s first term at Linz that Weininger became
a cult figure in Vienna. On 4 October 1903, his dying body was found on
the floor in the house in Schwarzspanierstrasse where Beethoven had
died. At the age of twenty-three, in an act of self-consciously symbolic
significance, he had shot himself in the home of the man whom he
considered to be the very greatest of geniuses. Sex and Character had
been published the previous spring, and had received, on the whole,
fairly bad reviews. Had it not been for the sensational circumstances of
its author’s death, it would probably have had no great impact. As it
was, on 17 October, a letter from August Strindberg appeared in Die
Fackel, describing the work as: ‘an awe-inspiring book, which has
probably solved the most difficult of all problems’. Thus was the
Weininger cult born.</p>
<p>Weininger’s suicide seemed to many to be the logical outcome of the
argument of his book, and it is primarily this that made him such a
cause célèbre in pre-war Vienna. His taking of his own life was seen,
not as a cowardly escape from suffering, but as an ethical deed, a brave
acceptance of a tragic conclusion. It was, according to Oswald Spengler,
‘a spiritual struggle’, which offered ‘one of the noblest spectacles
ever presented by a late religiousness’. As such, it inspired a number
of imitative suicides. Indeed, Wittgenstein himself began to feel
ashamed that he had not dared kill himself, that he had ignored a hint
that he was de trop in this world. This feeling lasted for nine years,
and was overcome only after he had convinced Bertrand Russell that he
possessed philosophic genius. His brother Rudolf’s suicide came just six
months after Weininger’s, and was, as we have seen, executed in an
equally theatrical manner.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s acknowledgement of Weininger’s influence, more than
that of any other, ties his life and work to the environment in which he
was raised. Weininger is a quintessentially Viennese figure. The themes
of his book, together with the manner of his death, form a potent symbol
of the social, intellectual and moral tensions of the fin de siècle
Vienna in which Wittgenstein grew up.</p>
<p>Running throughout the book is a very Viennese preoccupation with the
decay of modern times. Like Kraus, Weininger attributes this decay to
the rise of science and business and the decline of art and music, and
characterizes it, in an essentially aristocratic manner, as the triumph
of pettiness over greatness. In a passage reminiscent of the prefaces
Wittgenstein would write in the 1930s, for his own philosophical work,
Weininger denounces the modern age as:</p>
<p>… a time when art is content with daubs and seeks its inspiration in
the sports of animals; the time of a superficial anarchy, with no
feeling for Justice and the State; a time of communistic ethics, of the
most foolish of historical views, the materialistic interpretation of
history; a time of capitalism and of Marxism; a time when history, life
and science are no more than political economy and technical
instruction; a time when genius is supposed to be a form of madness; a
time with no great artists and no great philosophers; a time without
originality and yet with the most foolish craving for originality.14</p>
<p>Like Kraus, too, Weininger was inclined to identify those aspects of
modern civilization that he most disliked as Jewish, and to describe the
social and cultural trends of the age in terms of the sexual polarity
between the masculine and the feminine. Unlike Kraus, however, Weininger
emphasizes these two themes to an obsessive, almost lunatic, extent.</p>
<p>Sex and Character is dominated by an elaborately worked out theory
intended to justify Weininger’s misogyny and anti-Semitism. The central
point of the book, he says in the preface, is to ‘refer to a single
principle the whole contrast between men and women’.</p>
<p>The book is divided into two parts: the ‘biological-psychological’,
and the ‘logical-philosophical’. In the first he seeks to establish that
all human beings are biologically bisexual, a mixture of male and
female. Only the proportions differ, which is how he explains the
existence of homosexuals: they are either womanly men or masculine
women. The ‘scientific’ part of the book ends with a chapter on
‘Emancipated Women’, in which he uses this theory of bisexuality to
oppose the women’s movement. ‘A woman’s demand for emancipation and her
qualification for it’, he claims, ‘are in direct proportion to the
amount of maleness in her.’ Such women are, therefore, generally
lesbians, and as such are on a higher level than most women. These
masculine women should be given their freedom, but it would be a grave
mistake to let the majority of women imitate them.</p>
<p>The second, and much larger, part of the book discusses Man and
Woman, not as biological categories, but as ‘psychological types’,
conceived of as something like Platonic ideas. As actual men and women
are all mixtures of masculinity and femininity, Man and Woman do not
exist except as Platonic forms. Nevertheless, we are all psychologically
either a man or a woman. Curiously, Weininger thinks that, whereas it is
possible for a person to be biologically male but psychologically
female, the reverse is impossible. Thus, even emancipated, lesbian,
women are psychologically female. It follows that everything he says
about ‘Woman’ applies to all women and also to some men.</p>
<p>The essence of Woman, he says, is her absorption in sex. She is
nothing but sexuality; she is sexuality itself. Whereas men possess
sexual organs, ‘her sexual organs possess women’. The female is
completely preoccupied with sexual matters, whereas the male is
interested in much else, such as war, sport, social affairs, philosophy
and science, business and politics, religion and art.15 Weininger has a
peculiar epistemological theory to explain this, based on his notion of
a ‘henid’. A henid is a piece of psychical data before it becomes an
idea. Woman thinks in henids, which is why, for her, thinking and
feeling are the same thing. She looks to man, who thinks in clear and
articulated ideas, to clarify her data, to interpret her henids. That is
why women fall in love only with men cleverer than themselves. Thus, the
essential difference between man and woman is that, whereas ‘the male
lives consciously, the female lives unconsciously’.16</p>
<p>Weininger draws from this analysis alarmingly far-reaching ethical
implications. Without the ability to clarify her own henids, woman is
incapable of forming clear judgements, so the distinction between true
and false means nothing to her. Thus women are naturally, inescapably,
untruthful. Not that they are, on this account, immoral; they do not
enter the moral realm at all. Woman simply has no standard of right or
wrong. And, as she knows no moral or logical imperative, she cannot be
said to have a soul, and this means she lacks free will. From this it
follows that women have no ego, no individuality, and no character.
Ethically, women are a lost cause.</p>
<p>Turning from epistemology and ethics to psychology, Weininger
analyses women in terms of two further Platonic types: the mother and
the prostitute. Each individual woman is a combination of the two, but
is predominantly one or the other. There is no moral difference between
the two: the mother’s love for her child is as unthinking and
indiscriminate as the prostitute’s desire to make love to every man she
sees. (Weininger will have nothing to do with any explanation of
prostitution based on social and economic conditions. Women are
prostitutes, he says, because of the ‘disposition for and inclination to
prostitution’ which is ‘deep in the nature of women’.) The chief
difference between the two types is the form that their obsession with
sex takes: whereas the mother is obsessed with the object of sex, the
prostitute is obsessed with the act itself.17</p>
<p>All women, whether mothers or prostitutes, share a single
characteristic – ‘a characteristic which is really and exclusively
feminine’ – and that is the instinct of match-making.18 It is the ever
present desire of all women to see man and woman united. To be sure,
woman is interested first and foremost in her own sexual life, but that
is really a special case of her ‘only vital interest’ – ‘the interest
that sexual unions shall take place; the wish that as much of it as
possible shall occur, in all cases, places and times’.19</p>
<p>As an adjunct to his psychological investigation of woman, Weininger
has a chapter on Judaism. Again, the Jew is a Platonic idea, a
psychological type, which is a possibility (or a danger) for all
mankind, ‘but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion
only amongst the Jews’.20 The Jew is ‘saturated with femininity’ – ‘the
most manly Jew is more feminine than the least manly Aryan’.21 Like the
woman, the Jew has a strong instinct for pairing. He has a poor sense of
individuality and a correspondingly strong instinct to preserve the
race. The Jew has no sense of good and evil, and no soul. He is
non-philosophical and profoundly irreligious (the Jewish religion being
‘a mere historical tradition’). Judaism and Christianity are opposites:
the latter is ‘the highest expression of the highest faith’; the former
is ‘the extreme of cowardliness’.22 Christ was the greatest of all men
because he: ‘conquered in himself Judaism, the greatest negation, and
created Christianity, the strongest affirmation and the most direct
opposite of Judaism’.23</p>
<p>Weininger himself was both Jewish and homosexual (and therefore
possibly of the psychologically female type), and the idea that his
suicide was, in some way, a ‘solution’ could therefore be easily
assimilated within the most vulgar anti-Semitic or misogynist outlook.
Hitler, for example, is reported as having once remarked: ‘Dietrich
Eckhart told me that in all his life he had known just one good Jew:
Otto Weininger who killed himself on the day when he realised that the
Jew lives upon the decay of peoples.’ And the fact that fear of the
emancipation of women, and, particularly, of Jews, was a widespread
preoccupation in Vienna at the turn of the century no doubt accounts to
some extent for the book’s enormous popularity. It would later provide
convenient material for Nazi propaganda broadcasts.</p>
<p>But why did Wittgenstein admire the book so much? What did he learn
from it? Indeed, given that its claims to scientific biology are
transparently spurious, its epistemology obvious nonsense, its
psychology primitive, and its ethical prescriptions odious, what could
he possibly have learnt from it?</p>
<p>To see this, we have, I think, to turn aside from Weininger’s –
entirely negative – psychology of Woman, and look instead at his
psychology of Man. Only there do we find something in the book other
than bigotry and self-contempt, something that resonates with themes we
know to have been central to Wittgenstein’s thoughts as a teenager (and,
indeed, for the rest of his life), and that provides at least some hint
as to what Wittgenstein may have found to admire in it.</p>
<p>Unlike Woman, Man, according to Weininger, has a choice: he can, and
must, choose between the masculine and the feminine, between
consciousness and unconsciousness, will and impulse, love and sexuality.
It is every man’s ethical duty to choose the first of each of these
pairs, and the extent to which he is able to do this is the extent to
which he approximates to the very highest type of man: the genius.</p>
<p>The consciousness of the genius is the furthest removed from the
henid stage; ‘it has the greatest, most limpid clearness and
distinctness’.24 The genius has the best developed memory, the greatest
ability to form clear judgements, and, therefore, the most refined sense
of the distinctions between true and false, right and wrong. Logic and
ethics are fundamentally the same; ‘they are no more than duty to
oneself’.25 Genius ‘is the highest morality, and, therefore, it is
everyone’s duty’.26</p>
<p>Man is not born with a soul, but with the potential for one. To
realize this potential he has to find his real higher self, to escape
the limitations of his (unreal) empirical self. One route to this
self-discovery is love, through which ‘many men first come to know of
their own real nature, and to be convinced that they possess a
soul’:27</p>
<p>In love, man is only loving himself.28 Not his empirical self, not
the weaknesses and vulgarities, not the failings and smallnesses which
he outwardly exhibits; but all that he wants to be, all that he ought to
be, his truest, deepest, intelligible nature, free from all fetters of
necessity, from all taint of earth.</p>
<p>Naturally, Weininger is here talking of Platonic love. Indeed, for
him, there is only Platonic love, because: ‘any other so-called love
belongs to the kingdom of the senses’. Love and sexual desire are not
only not the same thing; they are in opposition to one another. That is
why the idea of love after marriage is make-believe. As sexual
attraction increases with physical proximity, love is strongest in
absence of the loved one. Indeed, love needs separation, a certain
distance, to preserve it: ‘what all the travels in the world could not
achieve, what time could not accomplish, may be brought about by
accidental, unintentional, physical contact with the beloved object, in
which the sexual impulse is awakened, and which suffices to kill love on
the spot’.29</p>
<p>The love of a woman, though it can arouse in a man some hint of his
higher nature, is, in the end, doomed either to unhappiness (if the
truth about the woman’s unworthiness is discovered) or to immorality (if
the lie about her perfection is kept up). The only love that is of
enduring worth is that ‘attached to the absolute, to the idea of
God’.30</p>
<p>Man should love, not woman, but his own soul, the divine in himself,
the ‘God who in my bosom dwells’. Thus he must resist the pairing
instinct of the woman and, despite pressure from women, free himself
from sex. To the objection that this suggestion, if adopted universally,
would be the death of the human race, Weininger replies that it would be
merely the death of the physical life, and would put in its place the
‘full development of the spiritual life’. Besides, he says: ‘no one who
is honest with himself feels bound to provide for the continuity of the
human race’:31</p>
<p>That the human race should persist is of no interest whatever to
reason; he who would perpetuate humanity would perpetuate the problem
and the guilt, the only problem and the only guilt.</p>
<p>The choice that Weininger’s theory offers is a bleak and terrible one
indeed: genius or death. If one can only live as a ‘Woman’ or as a ‘Jew’
– if, that is, one cannot free oneself from sensuality and earthly
desires – then one has no right to live at all. The only life worth
living is the spiritual life.</p>
<p>In its strict separation of love from sexual desire, its
uncompromising view of the worthlessness of everything save the products
of genius, and its conviction that sexuality is incompatible with the
honesty that genius demands, there is much in Weininger’s work that
chimes with attitudes we find Wittgenstein expressing time and again
throughout his life. So much so, that there is reason to believe that of
all the books he read in adolescence, Weininger’s is the one that had
the greatest and most lasting impact on his outlook.</p>
<p>Of particular importance, perhaps, is the peculiar twist that
Weininger gives to Kant’s Moral Law, which, on this account, not only
imposes an inviolable duty to be honest, but, in so doing, provides the
route for all men to discover in themselves whatever genius they
possess. To acquire genius, on this view, is not merely a noble
ambition; it is a Categorical Imperative. Wittgenstein’s recurring
thoughts of suicide between 1903 and 1912, and the fact that these
thoughts abated only after Russell’s recognition of his genius, suggest
that he accepted this imperative in all its terrifying severity.</p>
<p>So much for Wittgenstein’s intellectual development as a schoolboy,
which, we have seen, was inspired primarily by philosophical reflection
and (under Gretl’s guidance) fuelled by the reading of philosophers and
cultural critics. But what of his development in the technical subjects
– his advancement in the skills and knowledge required to succeed in his
chosen profession?</p>
<p>Of this we hear surprisingly little. The works by scientists which he
read as a teenager – Heinrich Hertz’s Principles of Mechanics, and
Ludwig Boltzmann’s Populäre Schriften – suggest an interest, not in
mechanical engineering, nor even, especially, in theoretical physics,
but rather in the philosophy of science.</p>
<p>Both (like the works previously discussed) espouse a fundamentally
Kantian view of the nature and method of philosophy. In Principles of
Mechanics Hertz addresses the problem of how to understand the
mysterious concept of ‘force’ as it is used in Newtonian physics. Hertz
proposes that, instead of giving a direct answer to the question: ‘What
is force?’, the problem should be dealt with by restating Newtonian
physics without using ‘force’ as a basic concept. ‘When these painful
contradictions are removed’, he writes, ’the question as to the nature
of force will not have been answered; but our minds, no longer vexed,
will cease to ask illegitimate questions.’32</p>
<p>This passage of Hertz was known by Wittgenstein virtually word for
word, and was frequently invoked by him to describe his own conception
of philosophical problems and the correct way to solve them. As we have
seen, philosophical thinking began for him with ‘painful contradictions’
(and not with the Russellian desire for certain knowledge); its aim was
always to resolve those contradictions and to replace confusion with
clarity.</p>
<p>He may well have been led to Hertz by reading Boltzmann’s Populäre
Schriften, a collection of Boltzmann’s more popular lectures, published
in 1905. The lectures present a similarly Kantian view of science, in
which our models of reality are taken to our experience of the world,
and not (as the empiricist tradition would have it) derived from it. So
ingrained in Wittgenstein’s philosophical thinking was this view that he
found the empiricist view difficult even to conceive.</p>
<p>Boltzmann was Professor of Physics at the University of Vienna, and
there was some talk of Wittgenstein’s studying with him after he had
left school. In 1906, however, the year that Wittgenstein left Linz,
Boltzmann committed suicide, despairing of ever being taken seriously by
the scientific world.</p>
<p>Independently of Boltzmann’s suicide, it seems, it had been decided
that Wittgenstein’s further education should advance his technical
knowledge rather than develop his interest in philosophy and theoretical
science. Accordingly, after leaving Linz he was sent – no doubt urged by
his father – to study mechanical engineering at the Technische
Hochschule (now the Technical University) in Charlottenburg, Berlin.</p>
<p>Of Wittgenstein’s two years in Berlin very little is known. The
college records show that he matriculated on 23 October 1906, that he
attended lectures for three semesters and that, having completed his
diploma course satisfactorily, he was awarded his certificate on 5 May
1908. Photographs of the time show him to be a handsome, immaculately
dressed young man, who might well have been – as he is reported to have
been a year later in Manchester – a ‘favourite with the ladies’.</p>
<p>He lodged with the family of one of his professors, Dr Jolles, who
adopted him as their own ‘little Wittgenstein’. Much later, after the
First World War had produced in him a transformation comparable to, and
perhaps even deeper than, the change he had undergone in 1903–4,
Wittgenstein was embarrassed by the intimacy he had shared with the
Jolles family, and replied to the friendly and affectionate letters he
received from Mrs Jolles with stiff politeness. But while he was in
Berlin, and for a number of years after he left, he was grateful enough
for the warm concern they showed him.</p>
<p>It was a time of competing interests and obligations. Wittgenstein’s
sense of duty towards his father impelled him to stick at his
engineering studies, and he developed an interest in the then very young
science of aeronautics. But, increasingly, he found himself gripped,
almost against his will, by philosophical questions. Inspired by the
diaries of Gottfried Keller, he began to write down his philosophical
reflections in the form of dated notebook entries.</p>
<p>In the short term, his father’s wishes prevailed, and on leaving
Berlin he went to Manchester to further his studies in aeronautics. But
in the long term, it was probably already clear to him that the only
life he could consider worthwhile was one spent in fulfilment of the
greater duty he owed to himself – to his own genius.</p>
