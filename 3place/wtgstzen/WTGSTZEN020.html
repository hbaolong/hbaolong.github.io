<h4 id="joining-the-ranks">17 JOINING THE RANKS</h4>
<p>IN HIS LETTER to Schlick of 31 July 1935, Wittgenstein wrote that he
would probably not be coming to Austria that summer:</p>
<p>At the beginning of September I want to travel to Russia andandandand
will either stay there or, after about two weeks, return to England.1
What, in that case, I will do in England is still completely uncertain,
but I will probably not continue in philosophy.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer of 1935 he made preparations for his impending
visit to Russia. He met regularly with those of his friends, many of
them members of the Communist Party, who had been to Russia or who might
be able to inform him about conditions there. Possibly he hoped, too,
that they could put him in contact with people who could help to find
work there for himself and Skinner. Among these friends were Maurice
Dobb, Nicholas Bachtin, Piero Sraffa and George Thomson. The impression
they received was that Wittgenstein wanted to settle in Russia as a
manual worker, or possibly to take up medicine, but in any case to
abandon philosophy. At a meeting with George Thomson in the Fellows’
garden at Trinity he explained that, since he was giving up
philosophical work, he had to decide what to do with his notebooks.
Should he leave them somewhere or should he destroy them? He talked at
length to Thomson about his philosophy, expressing doubts about its
worth. It was only after urgent appeals by Thomson that he agreed not to
destroy his notebooks, but to deposit them instead in the college
library.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was not the only one at Cambridge then seeking in Soviet
Russia an alternative to the countries of Western Europe, menaced as
those countries were by the growth of fascism and the problems of mass
unemployment. The summer of 1935 was the time when Marxism became, for
the undergraduates at Cambridge, the most important intellectual force
in the university, and when many students and dons visited the Soviet
Union in the spirit of pilgrimage. It was then that Anthony Blunt and
Michael Straight made their celebrated journey to Russia, which led to
the formation of the so-called ‘Cambridge Spy Ring’, and that the
Cambridge Communist Cell, founded a few years earlier by Maurice Dobb,
David Hayden-Guest and John Cornford, expanded to include most of the
intellectual élite at Cambridge, including many of the younger members
of the Apostles.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that Wittgenstein was never at any time a Marxist,
he was perceived as a sympathetic figure by the students who formed the
core of the Cambridge Communist Party, many of whom (Hayden-Guest,
Cornford, Maurice Cornforth etc.) attended his lectures. But
Wittgenstein’s reasons for wanting to visit Russia were very different.
His perception of the decline of the countries of Western Europe was
always more Spenglerian than Marxian, and, as we have remarked earlier,
it is likely that he was extremely attracted to the portrait of life in
the Soviet Union drawn by Keynes in his Short View of Russia – a
portrait which, while deprecating Marxism as an economic theory,
applauded its practice in Russia as a new religion, in which there were
no supernatural beliefs but, rather, deeply held religious
attitudes.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of this, Wittgenstein felt he might be understood by
Keynes. ‘I am sure that you partly understand my reasons for wanting to
go to Russia’, he wrote to him on 6 July, ‘and I admit that they are
partly bad and even childish reasons but it is true also that behind all
that there are deep and even good reasons.’2 Keynes, in fact,
disapproved of Wittgenstein’s plan, but despite this did all he could to
help Wittgenstein overcome the suspicions of the Soviet authorities.
Wittgenstein had had a meeting at the Russian Embassy with an official
called Vinogradoff, who, he told Keynes, was ‘exceedingly careful in our
conversation … He of course knew as well as anyone that recommendations
might help me but it was quite clear that he wasn’t going to help me get
any.’3 Characteristically, Keynes went straight to the top, and provided
Wittgenstein with an introduction to Ivan Maisky, the Russian Ambassador
in London: ‘May I venture to introduce to you Dr Ludwig Wittgenstein …
who is a distinguished philosopher [and] a very old and intimate friend
of mine … I should be extremely grateful for anything you could do for
him.’4 He added: ‘I must leave it to him to tell you his reasons for
wanting to go to Russia. He is not a member of the Communist Party, but
has strong sympathies with the way of life which he believes the new
regime in Russia stands for.’</p>
<p>At his meeting with Maisky, Wittgenstein took great pains to appear
both respectable and respectful. Keynes had warned him that, while
Maisky was a Communist, that did not mean he would not wish to be
addressed as ‘Your Excellency’, nor that he had any less respect than
any other high bourgeois official for standards of formality and
politeness. Wittgenstein took the advice to heart. The meeting was one
of the few occasions in his life when he wore a tie, and he used the
phrase ‘Your Excellency’ as often as he could. Indeed, as he later told
Gilbert Pattisson, he was so anxious to show respect to the ambassador
that he made a great show of wiping his shoes well on the mat – on the
way out of the room. After the meeting Wittgenstein reported to Keynes
that Maisky was: ‘definitely nice and in the end promised to send me
some addresses of people in Russia of whom I might get useful
information.5 He did not think that it was utterly hopeless for me to
try to get permission to settle in Russia though he too didn’t think it
was likely.’</p>
<p>Apart from these – not very encouraging – meetings at the Russian
Embassy, Wittgenstein also tried to make contacts through the Society
for Cultural Relations with the Soviet Union (SCR). The SCR was founded
in 1924 and was (indeed, is) an organization dedicated to improving
cultural links between Britain and the Soviet Union. It organizes
lectures, discussions and exhibitions, and publishes its own magazine,
the Anglo-Soviet Journal, each issue of which in the 1930s carried an
advertisement for the tours of Russia organized by Intourist, the Soviet
travel company (‘For the experience of a lifetime visit USSR’ etc.).
Because (unlike its companion organization, the Society of Friends of
Soviet Russia) its aims were cultural rather than political, the SCR
numbered among its members many non-Communists such as Charles Trevelyan
and, indeed, Keynes himself. By 1935, however, it was dominated by much
the same people (Hayden-Guest, Pat Sloan etc.) as the Society of
Friends. On 19 August Wittgenstein went to the offices of the SCR to
meet with Miss Hilda Browning, its Vice-Chairman. The following day he
reported to Gilbert Pattisson:</p>
<p>My interview with Miss B.6 went off better than I had expected. At
least I got one useful piece of information: – that my only chance of
getting a permission to settle in R. is to go there as a tourist
andandandand talk to officials; andandandand that all I can do at this
end is to try to get letters of introduction. Also Miss B. told me that
she would give me such letters to two places. This is, on the whole,
better than nothing. It doesn’t however settle anything andandandand I’m
as much in the dark as ever, not only about what they’ll let me do but
also about what I want to do. It is shameful, but I change my mind about
it every two hours. I see what a perfect ass I am, at bottom
andandandand feel rather rotten.</p>
<p>The two places to which he had secured an introduction were the
Institute of the North and the Institute of National Minorities. These
were both educational institutes dedicated to improving the level of
literacy among the ethnic minorities in the Soviet Union. Though
considering this ‘better than nothing’, Wittgenstein did not
particularly want a teaching job. But, as he had been told by Keynes, he
was likely to get permission to settle in the Soviet Union only if he
received an invitation from a Soviet organization: ‘If you were a
qualified technician of a sort likely to be useful to them’, Keynes
wrote to him, ’that might not be difficult. But, without some such
qualification, which might very well be a medical qualification, it
would be difficult.’7 Wittgenstein, who throughout his life harboured a
desire to become a doctor, considered the possibility of studying
medicine in England with the intention of practising in Russia, and even
secured from Keynes a promise to finance his medical training. What he
really wanted, however, was to be allowed to settle in Russia as a
manual worker. But, as became increasingly clear to him, it was
extremely unlikely that he would receive an invitation from a Soviet
organization to do that. The one thing that was not in short supply in
Soviet Russia was unskilled labour.</p>
<p>By the time he left for Leningrad, on 7 September, all Wittgenstein
had managed to obtain were the introductions from Hilda Browning and a
few names and addresses of people living in Moscow. He was seen off at
Hay’s Wharf in London by Gilbert Pattisson, Francis being too ill to
make the trip. It was understood, however, that he was looking for work
on Francis’s behalf as well as his own. On the same boat was Dr George
Sacks, who has recalled that he and his wife sat opposite Wittgenstein
at meal-times. Next to Wittgenstein sat an American Greek Orthodox
priest. Wittgenstein, who seemed depressed and preoccupied, sat staring
into space, not speaking to anyone, until one day he introduced himself
to the priest by sticking up his hand and exclaiming: ‘Wittgenstein!’ to
which the priest replied by saying his own name.8 For the rest of the
journey he was silent.</p>
<p>He arrived in Leningrad on 12 September, and for the next two weeks
his pocket diary is full of the names and addresses of the many people
he contacted in an effort to secure an offer of employment. In Leningrad
he visited, as well as the Institute of the North, the university
professor of philosophy, Mrs Tatiana Gornstein, and offered to give a
philosophy course at Leningrad University. At Moscow he met Sophia
Janovskaya, the professor of mathematical logic, with whom he struck up
a friendship that lasted through correspondence long after he had
returned to England. He was attracted to her by the forthrightness of
her speech. Upon meeting him for the first time, she exclaimed: ‘What,
not the great Wittgenstein?’ and during a conversation on philosophy she
told him quite simply: ‘You ought to read more Hegel.’ From their
discussions of philosophy, Professor Janovskaya received the (surely
false) impression that Wittgenstein was interested in dialectical
materialism and the development of Soviet philosophic thought. It was
apparently through Janovskaya that Wittgenstein was offered first a
chair in philosophy at Kazan University, and then a teaching post in
philosophy at the University of Moscow.</p>
<p>In Moscow Wittgenstein also met two or three times with Pat Sloan,
the British Communist who was then working as a Soviet trade union
organizer (a period of his life recalled in the book Russia Without
Illusions, 1938). It seems quite likely that these meetings centred on
Wittgenstein’s continuing hopes to work in some manual capacity. If so,
they were apparently unsuccessful. George Sacks recalls that in Moscow:
‘we [he and his wife] heard that Wittgenstein wanted to work on a
collective farm, but the Russians told him his own work was a useful
contribution and he ought to go back to Cambridge’.9</p>
<p>On 17 September, while still in Moscow, Wittgenstein received a
letter from Francis urging him to stay as long as it took to find work.
‘I wish I could be with you and see things with you’, he wrote.10 ‘But I
feel it is as though I was with you.’ From this letter it appears that
Wittgenstein and Skinner were planning to spend the following academic
year preparing the Brown Book for publication, prior, presumably, to
their settling in the Soviet Union. This makes sense in that the coming
academic year, 1935–6, was to be the final year of both Skinner’s
three-year postgraduate scholarship and Wittgenstein’s five-year
fellowship at Trinity. ‘I think a lot about the work which we are going
to do next year’, Francis told him. ‘I feel that the spirit of the
method which you used last year is so good’:</p>
<p>Everything, I feel, is absolutely simple and yet it’s all full of
light. I feel it will be very good to go on with it and get it ready for
publication. I feel that the method is so valuable. I hope very much we
shall be able to get on with it. We will do our best.</p>
<p>‘I’d like to say again’, he added, ‘that I hope you will stay longer
in Moscow than the time you arranged for if you feel there is any chance
that you might learn more. It would be valuable for both of us.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein evidently saw no reason to extend his stay. His visit
had served only to confirm what he had been told before he left: that he
was welcome to enter the Soviet Union as a teacher, but unwelcome as a
worker on a collective farm. On the Sunday before he left he wrote a
postcard to Pattisson asking to be met in London:</p>
<p>My dear Gilbert!11</p>
<p>Tomorrow evening I shall leave Moskow (I am staying in the rooms
which Napoleon had in 1812). The day after tomorrow my boat sails from
Leningrad andandandand I can only hope that Neptune will have a heart
when he sees me. My boat is due in London on Sunday 29th [September].
Could you either meet the boat or leave a message for me at my Palace
(usually called ‘Strand Palace’)? I’m certainly looking forward to
seeing your old and bloody face again. Ever in blood.</p>
<p>Ludwig</p>
<p>P.S. If the censor reads this it serves him right!</p>
<p>After his return to England Wittgenstein very rarely discussed his
trip to Russia. He sent Francis to deliver a report to Fania Pascal,
which told her of his meeting with Mrs Janovskaya and his offer of an
academic job at Kazan, and concluded with a statement that: ’He had
taken no decisions about his future.’12 What the report did not provide
were any of Wittgenstein’s impressions of Soviet Russia – any hint of
whether he liked or disliked what he had seen. On this he remained,
apart from one or two isolated comments, completely silent. The reason
he gave friends for this silence was that he did not wish his name to be
used, as Russell had allowed his name to be used (after the publication
of Theory and Practice of Bolshevism), to support anti-Soviet
propaganda.</p>
<p>This suggests that, had he been open about his impression of the
Soviet Union, he would have drawn an unflattering picture. An important
clue to his attitude perhaps lies in his remark to Gilbert Pattisson
that living in Russia was rather like being a private in the army. It
was difficult, he told Pattisson, for ‘people of our upbringing’ to live
there because of the degree of petty dishonesty that was necessary even
to survive. If Wittgenstein thought of life in Russia as comparable to
his experience on the Goplana during the First World War, it is perhaps
not surprising that he showed so little inclination to settle there
after he returned from his brief visit.</p>
<p>He nevertheless repeatedly expressed his sympathy for the Soviet
régime and his belief that, as material conditions for ordinary Soviet
citizens were improving, the régime was strong and unlikely to collapse.
He spoke admiringly of the educational system in Russia, remarking that
he had never seen people so eager to learn and so attentive to what they
were being told. But perhaps his most important reason for sympathizing
with Stalin’s régime was that there was in Russia so little
unemployment. ‘The important thing’, he once said to Rush Rhees, ‘is
that the people have work.’13 When the regimentation of life in Russia
was mentioned – when it was pointed out that, although they were
employed, the workers there had no freedom to leave or change their jobs
– Wittgenstein was not impressed. ‘Tyranny’, he told Rhees with a shrug
of his shoulders, ‘doesn’t make me feel indignant.’14 The suggestion
that ‘rule by bureaucracy’ was bringing class distinctions in Russia,
however, did arouse his indignation: ’If anything could destroy my
sympathy with the Russian regime, it would be the growth of class
distinctions.’15</p>
<p>For two years after his return from Russia Wittgenstein toyed with
the idea of taking up the teaching post in Moscow that he had been
offered. During this time he continued to correspond with Sophia
Janovskaya, and when he went away to Norway he arranged with Fania
Pascal for Janovskaya to be sent insulin for her diabetes. As late as
June 1937 he remarked in a letter to Engelmann: ‘perhaps I shall go to
Russia’.16 Shortly after this, however, the offer of a post was
withdrawn, because (according to Piero Sraffa) by this time all Germans
(including Austrians) had become suspect in Russia.17</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even after the show trials of 1936, the worsening of
relations between Russia and the West and the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939,
Wittgenstein continued to express his sympathy with the Soviet régime –
so much so that he was taken by some of his students at Cambridge to be
a ‘Stalinist’. This label is, of course, nonsense. But at a time when
most people saw only the tyranny of Stalin’s rule, Wittgenstein
emphasized the problems with which Stalin had to deal and the scale of
his achievement in dealing with them. On the eve of the Second World War
he asserted to Drury that England and France between them would not be
able to defeat Hitler’s Germany; they would need the support of Russia.
He told Drury: ‘People have accused Stalin of having betrayed the
Russian Revolution.18 But they have no idea of the problems that Stalin
had to deal with; and the dangers he saw threatening Russia.’ He
immediately added, as though it were somehow relevant: ‘I was looking at
a picture of the British Cabinet and I thought to myself, “a lot of
wealthy old men”.’ This remark recalls Keynes’s characterization of
Russia as ‘the beautiful and foolish youngest son of the European
family, with hair on his head, nearer to both the earth and to heaven
than his bald brothers in the West’. Wittgenstein’s reasons for wanting
to live in Russia, both the ‘bad and even childish’ reasons and the
‘deep and even good’ ones, had much to do, I think, with his desire to
dissociate himself from the old men of the West, and from the
disintegrating and decaying culture of Western Europe.</p>
<p>It is also, of course, one more manifestation of his perennial desire
to join the ranks. The Soviet authorities knew, just as the Austrian
authorities had in 1915, that he would be more use to them as an officer
than as a private; and Wittgenstein himself realized that he could not
really tolerate life among the ‘petty dishonesty’ of the ordinary
soldiers. Yet he continued to wish it could be otherwise.</p>
<p>When, in the autumn of 1935, Wittgenstein began the final year of his
fellowship at Trinity, he still had little idea of what he would do
after it had expired. Perhaps he would go to Russia – perhaps, like
Rowland Hutt, get a job among ‘ordinary people’; or perhaps, as Skinner
had wanted, he would concentrate on preparing the Brown Book for
publication. One thing seemed sure: he would not continue to lecture at
Cambridge.</p>
<p>His lectures during this last year centred on the theme of ‘Sense
Data and Private Experience’. In these lectures he tried to combat the
philosopher’s temptation to think that, when we experience something
(when we see something, feel pain etc.), there is some thing, a sense
datum, that is the primary content of our experience. He took his
examples, however, not from philosophers but from ordinary speech. And
when he quoted from literature, it was not from the great philosophical
works, nor from the philosophical journal Mind, but from Street
andandandand Smith’s Detective Story Magazine.</p>
<p>He began one lecture by reading a passage from Street andandandand
Smith in which the narrator, a detective, is alone on the deck of a ship
in the middle of the night, with no sound except the ticking of the
ship’s clock. The detective muses to himself: ‘A clock is a bewildering
instrument at best: measuring a fragment of infinity: measuring
something which does not exist perhaps.’ Wittgenstein told his class
that it is much more revealing and important when you find this sort of
confusion in something said ‘in a silly detective story’ than it is when
you find it in something said ‘by a silly philosopher’:19</p>
<p>Here you might say ‘obviously a clock is not a bewildering instrument
at all’. – If in some situation it strikes you as a bewildering
instrument, and you can then bring yourself round to saying that of
course it is not bewildering – then this is the way to solve a
philosophical problem.</p>
<p>The clock becomes a bewildering instrument here because he says about
it ‘it measures a fragment of infinity, measuring something which does
not exist perhaps’. What makes the clock bewildering is that he
introduces a sort of entity which he then can’t see, and it seems like a
ghost.</p>
<p>The connection between this and what we were saying about sense data:
What is bewildering is the introduction of something we might call
‘intangible’. It seems as though there is nothing intangible about the
chair or the table, but there is about the fleeting personal
experience.</p>
<p>A recurrent theme of Wittgenstein’s lectures for that year was his
concern to uphold, against philosophers, our ordinary perception of the
world. When a philosopher raises doubts, about time or about mental
states, that do not occur to the ordinary man, this is not because the
philosopher has more insight than the ordinary man, but because, in a
way, he has less; he is subject to temptations to misunderstand that do
not occur to the non-philosopher:</p>
<p>We have the feeling that the ordinary man, if he talks of ‘good’, of
‘number’ etc.,20 does not really understand what he is talking about. I
see something queer about perception and he talks about it as if it were
not queer at all. Should we say he knows what he is talking about or
not?</p>
<p>You can say both. Suppose people are playing chess. I see queer
problems when I look into the rules and scrutinise them. But Smith and
Brown play chess with no difficulty. Do they understand the game? Well,
they play it.</p>
<p>The passage is redolent of Wittgenstein’s own doubts about his status
as a philosopher, his weariness of ‘seeing queer problems’ and his
desire to start playing the game rather than scrutinizing its rules. His
thoughts turned again to the idea of training as a doctor. Drury was at
this time preparing for his first MB examination at Dublin, and
Wittgenstein wrote asking him to make enquiries about the possibility of
his entering the medical school there, his training presumably to be
paid for by Keynes. He suggested to Drury that the two of them might
practise together as psychiatrists. Wittgenstein felt that he might have
a special talent for this branch of medicine, and was particularly
interested in Freudian psychoanalysis. That year he sent Drury, as a
birthday present, Freud’s Interpretation of Dreams, telling Drury that
when he first read it he said to himself: ’Here at last is a
psychologist who has something to say.’21</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s feeling that he would have made a good psychiatrist
seems to rest on a belief that his style of philosophizing and Freudian
psychoanalysis required a similar gift. Not, of course, that they are
the same technique. Wittgenstein reacted angrily when his philosophical
method was dubbed ‘therapeutic positivism’ and compared with
psychoanalysis. When, for example, A. J. Ayer drew the comparison in an
article in the Listener, he received from Wittgenstein a strongly worded
letter of rebuke. However, Wittgenstein was inclined to see some sort of
connection between his work and Freud’s. He once described himself to
Rhees as a ‘disciple of Freud’, and at various times summed up the
achievements of both himself and Freud in strikingly similar phrases.
‘It’s22 all excellent similes’, he said in a lecture of Freud’s work;
and of his own contribution to philosophy: ’What I invent are new
similes.’23 This ability to form a synoptic view by constructing
illuminating similes and metaphors was, it appears, what he wished to
contribute to psychiatric medicine.</p>
<p>As the year wore on, however, Wittgenstein’s interest in training as
a doctor or in getting any other sort of job declined in favour of the
idea of finishing his book. At the end of the year, as his fellowship
was coming to an end, Wittgenstein discussed the possibilities open to
him with a number of his favourite students. The latest of these was the
postgraduate student Rush Rhees. Rhees had arrived in Cambridge in
September 1935 to study under G. E. Moore, after having studied
philosophy previously at Edinburgh, Göttingen and Innsbruck. He had, at
first, been put off attending Wittgenstein’s lectures by the mannerisms
of Wittgenstein’s students, but in February 1936 he overcame these
misgivings and attended all the remaining lectures of that year. He
became one of Wittgenstein’s closest friends, and remained so until
Wittgenstein’s death. In June 1936 Wittgenstein invited Rhees to tea and
discussed with him the question of whether he should try to get a job of
some sort, or go somewhere by himself and spend his time working on his
book. He told Rhees: ’I still have a little money. And I could live and
work by myself as long as that lasts.’24</p>
<p>This latter idea held sway, and when Wittgenstein and Skinner visited
Drury in Dublin later that June, the issue of training as a psychiatrist
was not raised. What perhaps clinched the decision was news of the death
of Moritz Schlick. Wittgenstein was in Dublin when he heard that Schlick
had been murdered – shot on the steps of Vienna University by a mentally
deranged student. The fact that the student later became a member of the
Nazi Party gave rise to rumours that the killing had a political motive,
although the evidence suggests that the student had a more personal
grudge against Schlick, who had rejected his doctoral thesis. Upon
hearing the news, Wittgenstein immediately wrote to Friedrich
Waismann:</p>
<p>Dear Mr Waismann,</p>
<p>The death of Schlick is indeed a great misfortune. Both you and I
have lost much. I do not know how I should express my sympathy, which as
you know, I really feel, to his wife and children. If it is possible for
you, you would do me a great kindness if you contact Mrs Schlick or one
of the children and tell them that I think of them with warm sympathy
but I do not know what I should write to them. Should it be impossible
for you (externally or internally) to convey this message, please let me
know.</p>
<p>With kind sympathy and regards</p>
<p>Yours</p>
<p>Ludwig Wittgenstein</p>
<p>Schlick’s death finally put an end to any idea there might still have
been to fulfil the plans made in 1929 for Waismann and Wittgenstein to
co-operate together on a book. With Waismann’s exasperation at
Wittgenstein’s constant changes of mind, and Wittgenstein’s distrust of
Waismann’s understanding of him, only their mutual respect for Schlick,
and Schlick’s encouragement to persist with the project, had provided
even a slender hope of completion. After Schlick’s death Waismann
decided to work without Wittgenstein, and signed a contract to finish
the book himself and have it published under his own name. The book
reached the galley-proof stage in 1939, but was then withdrawn.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, meanwhile, decided to do as he had done in 1913 – to go
to Norway, where he could live alone without any distractions and bring
his work to completion. It is possible that his decision was made in the
wake of Schlick’s death, but possible too that it was prompted by the
more personal reason of needing to get away from the ‘distraction’ of
his relationship with Francis, whose three-year postgraduate studentship
ended at the same time as Wittgenstein’s fellowship.</p>
<p>Until the summer of 1936 it seems to have been understood that
whatever Wittgenstein and Francis would do — train as doctors, go to
Russia, work with ‘ordinary’ people or work on Wittgenstein’s book –
they would do together. So, at least, it was understood by Francis. It
is doubtful, however, whether Wittgenstein ever took Francis seriously
as a philosophical collaborator; he was useful to dictate ideas to,
especially when, as in the case of the Blue and Brown Books, the
dictation was done in English. But for the discussion of ideas, the
clarification of thoughts, Francis was no use; his awed respect for
Wittgenstein paralysed him and got in the way of his making any useful
contribution. ‘Sometimes’, Wittgenstein told Drury, ‘his silence
infuriates me and I shout at him, “Say something, Francis!”’ ‘But’, he
added, ‘Francis isn’t a thinker.25 You know Rodin’s statue called The
Thinker ; it struck me the other day that I couldn’t imagine Francis in
that attitude.’</p>
<p>For similar reasons Wittgenstein discouraged Francis from going on
with academic work. ‘He would never be happy in academic life’, he
decided, and Francis, as always, accepted his decision. It was not,
however, the view of Francis’s family, nor that of many of his friends.
Louis Goodstein, for example, who was Francis’s contemporary at both St
Paul’s and Cambridge and who later became Professor of Mathematical
Logic at Leicester University, thought that Francis might have had a
promising career as a professional mathematician. He was one of the
first people to be told by Francis of his decision to abandon
mathematics, and he disapproved strongly, seeing in the decision only
the unfortunate influence of Wittgenstein’s own dislike of academic
life. So, too, did Francis’s family. His mother particularly came to
dislike deeply the influence that Wittgenstein was exerting on her son.
She reacted with great consternation both to the plan to settle in
Russia and to the idea that Francis should abandon his potentially
brilliant academic career. His sister, Priscilla Truscott, was equally
incredulous. ‘Why?’ she demanded. ‘Why?’</p>
<p>For Francis, however, the only person whose opinion mattered was
Wittgenstein, and he resolutely adhered to Wittgenstein’s decision, even
when that meant living away from Wittgenstein himself and working in a
job which made little use of his talents and in which he felt exploited.
It was not to train as a doctor, but as a factory mechanic, that Skinner
left university, and not alongside Wittgenstein, but on his own. The
idea that he might train as a doctor was impractical: his parents could
not afford to see him through medical studies, and Keynes’s promise to
finance Wittgenstein’s medical training did not extend to Francis.
Francis volunteered to fight in the Spanish Civil War alongside the
International Brigade, but was turned down because of his physical
disability. (Francis, whose health was always precarious, was lame in
one leg as a result of the osteomyelitis from which he suffered as a
young boy and from which he was always subject to renewed attacks.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s (and therefore Skinner’s) second choice of career
after medicine was that of a mechanic. And so in the summer of 1936
Francis was taken on as a two-year apprentice mechanic at the Cambridge
Instrument Company. For most of the time he was employed in making
mainscrews, a repetitive and tiring task that he neither enjoyed nor
found at all interesting; it was simply a drudge which he put up with
for Wittgenstein’s sake. Fania Pascal, however, believes that Skinner
was happier among working people than among people of his own class. The
working people were, she says, kinder and less self-conscious. This is
perhaps true, although for the first few years at the factory Francis
spent little time socializing with his colleagues. His evenings were
spent either alone or with friends from the university – the Bachtins,
Rowland Hutt and Pascal herself. What he wanted more than anything else
was to live and work together with Wittgenstein, and this he had been
denied by Wittgenstein himself.</p>
<p>Francis did not have a Weiningerian conception of love; he did not
believe that love needed a separation, a certain distance, to preserve
it. Wittgenstein, on the other hand, probably shared Weininger’s view.
While in Norway he recorded in his diary that he realized how unique
Francis was – that he really appreciated him – only when he was away
from him. And thus it was, perhaps, precisely to get away from him that
he decided to go to Norway.</p>
<p>Before he left for Norway Wittgenstein took a holiday in France with
Gilbert Pattisson, the two touring the Bordeaux region together in a
car. Pattisson was one of the relatively few people with whom
Wittgenstein could relax and enjoy himself. For Pattisson’s part,
however, Wittgenstein’s company could be a little too heavy. He
accordingly insisted, as he had before in 1931, on spending at least a
few nights of the holiday away from Wittgenstein at a fashionable
resort, where he could indulge himself in unfettered luxury – wining,
dining and gambling. On the one occasion when Wittgenstein accompanied
Pattisson in the pleasures of gambling, he showed himself to be a novice
in the art of wasting money. They went together to the Casino Royan,
where they played roulette, a game obviously new to Wittgenstein. He
studied the game carefully before remarking to Pattisson, incredulously:
‘I don’t see how you can win!’ Sometimes, it seems, there is more point
in scrutinizing the rules than in playing the game.26</p>
