<h4 id="confessions">18 CONFESSIONS</h4>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN’S LEAVING FOR Norway in August 1936 is strongly
reminiscent of his earlier departure in October 1913. In both cases he
was leaving for an indefinite period to accomplish a definite task – the
preparation of a final formulation of his philosophical remarks. In both
cases, too, he was leaving behind someone he loved.</p>
<p>The difference is that in 1913 Pinsent had had no wish to accompany
him. It is doubtful whether Pinsent ever realized how much Wittgenstein
was in love with him, and almost certain that he did not return that
love. He was ‘thankful’ for his ‘acquaintance’ with Wittgenstein, but
not in any way dependent upon it. In October 1913 Pinsent’s training as
a lawyer figured much larger in his concerns than his friendship with
Wittgenstein, a break from whom possibly came to him as something of a
relief.</p>
<p>For Francis, however, his relationship with Wittgenstein was the very
centre of his life: if asked, he would have dropped everything to go and
live with him in Norway. ‘When I got your letter’, he wrote just a few
weeks after they were separated, ‘I wished I could come and help you
clean your room.’1 His life in Cambridge without Wittgenstein was lonely
and dreary. He no longer got on well with his family, he could no longer
participate in Wittgenstein’s work, and, though he persevered with it
for Wittgenstein’s sake, he disliked his job at the factory. As he had
no doubt been asked by Wittgenstein to do, he gave regular reports of
his work. They sound far from enthusiastic: ‘My work goes on all right.
I am working at mainscrews’ (21.8.36); ‘My work is going on all right. I
am almost reaching the end of making the mainscrews. Last week I had to
do some hand tool work on them, which was difficult at first. I am now
polishing them up ready to be nickelled’ (1.9.36); ‘I have an order for
200 draught and pressure gauges. I wish there weren’t going to be so
many’ (14.10.36). Eventually, after a discussion with Rowland Hutt about
his position at the factory, even the mild and compliant Francis was
moved to express his dissatisfaction:</p>
<p>I don’t feel clear about my relation to the firm.2 I don’t feel clear
whether I am getting work which makes full use of me. It seems to me
(and Hutt agrees with me) that there is a line to be drawn between being
favoured exceptionally and letting them do anything with you. For
instance the foreman said to me that if I had been going to be there
five years he could have advanced me very quickly, but as I was only
going to be there two years and the firm knew anyhow I would not ever be
much use to them, it was very different.</p>
<p>He tried, he said, to remember what Wittgenstein had told him about
being ‘hopeful, grateful andandandand thoughtful’, but in such
circumstances it was not easy. He does not say so, but one can imagine
him thinking that in such a position he had little to hope for, nothing
to be grateful for and nothing to occupy his thoughts except that he
would rather be with Wittgenstein. His conversation with Hutt, he told
Wittgenstein, ‘made me feel how much I wished I could have you here to
talk with you’. Time and again in his letters he emphasizes that: ‘I
think of you a lot with great love.’ Wittgenstein’s side of this
correspondence has not survived, but the form of these declarations of
love sometimes suggests that they were written to reassure doubts that
Wittgenstein might have expressed: ‘My feelings for you haven’t changed
at all.3 This is the honest truth. I think of you a lot and with great
love.’</p>
<p>It is likely that the advice to stay ‘hopeful, grateful andandandand
thoughtful’ was all that Francis received in the way of sympathetic
understanding from Wittgenstein. In Norway, Wittgenstein gave more
thought to himself and to his work – the two, as ever, being
inextricably linked – than he did to Francis. And, as in 1913–14, and
again in 1931, being alone in Norway proved conducive to thinking
seriously about both logic and his sins.</p>
<p>‘I do believe that it was the right thing for me to come here thank
God’, he wrote to Moore in October.4 ‘I can’t imagine that I could have
worked anywhere as I do here. It’s the quiet and, perhaps, the wonderful
scenery; I mean, its quiet seriousness.’ To the news that both Moore and
Rhees were finding it difficult to write anything, Wittgenstein replied
that this was a good sign: ‘One can’t drink wine while it ferments, but
that it’s fermenting shows that it isn’t dish-water’. ‘You see’, he
added, ‘I still make beautiful similes.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein sent Moore a map, showing his hut in relation to the
fjord, the neighbouring mountains and the nearest village. The point was
to illustrate that it was impossible for him to get to the village
without rowing. In clement weather this was not too bad, but by October
it was wet and cold. He wrote to Pattisson: ‘The weather has changed
from marvellous to rotten.5 It rains like hell now. Two days ago we had
our first snow.’ Pattisson responded by sending Wittgenstein a
sou’wester, with which Wittgenstein was very pleased. Recalling the
‘Letters from a Satisfied Customer’, he wrote: ’“Both fit and style are
perfect” as they always write to Mr Burton, the tailor of taste.’6</p>
<p>He had taken with him a copy of the Brown Book, with the intention of
using it as the basic material out of which to construct a final version
of his book. For over a month, he worked on a revision of it,
translating it from English into German and rewriting it as he went
along. At the beginning of November he gave this up, writing, in heavy
strokes: ‘Dieser ganze “Versuch einer Umarbeitung” vom (Anfang) bis
hierher ist nichts wert’ (‘This whole attempt at a revision, from the
beginning right up to here, is worthless’). He explained in a letter to
Moore that when he read through what he had written so far he found it
all, ‘or nearly all, boring and artificial’:7</p>
<p>For having the English version before me had cramped my thinking. I
therefore decided to start all over again and not to let my thoughts be
guided by anything but themselves. – I found it difficult the first day
or two but then it became easy. And so I’m writing now a new version and
I hope I’m not wrong in saying that it’s somewhat better than the
last.</p>
<p>This new version became the final formulation of the opening of
Wittgenstein’s book. It forms, roughly, paragraphs 1–188 of the
published text of Philosophical Investigations (about a quarter of the
book), and is the only section of Wittgenstein’s later work with which
he was fully satisfied – the only part he never later attempted to
revise or rearrange, or indicate that he would wish to revise if he had
time.</p>
<p>To a large extent it follows the arrangement of the Brown Book,
beginning with St Augustine’s account of how he learnt to talk, using
that to introduce the notion of a language-game and then proceeding to a
discussion of following a rule. In this final version, however, the
passage from Augustine’s Confessions is actually quoted, and the point
of beginning with that passage is spelt out more clearly:</p>
<p>These words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the
essence of human language. It is this: the individual words in language
name objects – sentences are combinations of such names.8 – In this
picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word
has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the
object for which the word stands.</p>
<p>The rest of the book was to examine the implications of this idea and
the traps into which it led philosophers, and to suggest routes out of
those traps. These routes all begin by dislodging the
(pre-philosophical) picture of language expressed by Augustine, which
gives rise to the philosophical idea mentioned above. In this way,
Wittgenstein hoped to dig out philosophical confusion by its
pre-philosophical roots.</p>
<p>The quotation from St Augustine is not given, as is sometimes
thought, to present a theory of language, which Wittgenstein will then
show to be false. Confessions, after all, is not (primarily, at least) a
philosophical work, but a religious autobiography, and in the passage
quoted Augustine is not theorizing, but is describing how he learnt to
talk. And this is precisely why it is appropriate for presenting the
target of Wittgenstein’s philosophical enterprise. Though it expresses
no theory, what is contained in Augustine’s account is a picture. And,
for Wittgenstein, all philosophical theories are rooted in just such a
picture, and must be uprooted by the introduction of a new picture, a
new metaphor:</p>
<p>A simile that has been absorbed into the forms of our language
produces a false appearance and this disquiets us.9</p>
<p>A picture held us captive. And we could not get outside it, for it
lay in our language and language seemed to repeat it to us
inexorably.10</p>
<p>The final version of the beginning of Wittgenstein’s book differs
from the Brown Book in that, rather than simply leading the reader
through a series of language-games without any explanation, he pauses
now and again to elucidate his procedure and to guard against some
possible misunderstandings of it:</p>
<p>Our clear and simple language-games are not preparatory studies of a
future regularization of language – as it were first approximations,
ignoring friction and air-resistance.11 The language-games are set up as
objects of comparison which are meant to throw light on the facts of our
language by way not only of similarities, but also of
dissimilarities.</p>
<p>It is not our aim to refine or complete the system of rules for the
use of our words in unheard-of ways.12</p>
<p>For the clarity that we are aiming at is indeed complete clarity. But
this simply means that the philosophical problems should completely
disappear. The real discovery is the one that makes me capable of
stopping doing philosophy when I want to. – The one that gives
philosophy peace, so that it is no longer tormented by questions which
bring itself in question. – Instead we now demonstrate a method, by
examples; and the series of examples can be broken off. – Problems are
solved (difficulties eliminated), not a single problem.</p>
<p>Anticipating a natural reaction to his conception of philosophy and
its method, he asks: ‘Where does our investigation get its importance
from, since it seems only to destroy everything interesting, that is,
all that is great and important? (As it were all the buildings, leaving
behind only bits of stone and rubble.)’ He answers: ‘What we are
destroying is nothing but houses of cards and we are clearing up the
ground of language on which they stand.’ And, changing the metaphor, but
keeping to the same point:</p>
<p>The results of philosophy are the uncovering of one or other piece of
plain nonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running
its head up against the limits of language.13 These bumps make us see
the value of the discovery.</p>
<p>Whether such explanations would mean anything to people who have not
themselves experienced such ‘bumps’ remains doubtful. But then, the
method was not developed for such people, just as Freudian analysis was
not developed for the psychologically unconcerned. Philosophical
Investigations – more, perhaps, than any other philosophical classic –
makes demands, not just on the reader’s intelligence, but on his
involvement. Other great philosophical works – Schopenhauer’s World and
Representation, say – can be read with interest and entertainment by
someone who ‘wants to know what Schopenhauer said’. But if Philosophical
Investigations is read in this spirit it will very quickly become
boring, and a chore to read, not because it is intellectually difficult,
but because it will be practically impossible to gather what
Wittgenstein is ‘saying’. For, in truth, he is not saying anything; he
is presenting a technique for the unravelling of confusions. Unless
these are your confusions, the book will be of very little interest.</p>
<p>Connected with the degree of personal involvement required to make
sense of it, there is another reason why it seems appropriate to begin
the book with a quotation from St Augustine’s Confessions. And that is
that, for Wittgenstein, all philosophy, in so far as it is pursued
honestly and decently, begins with a confession. He often remarked that
the problem of writing good philosophy and of thinking well about
philosophical problems was one of the will more than of the intellect –
the will to resist the temptation to misunderstand, the will to resist
superficiality. What gets in the way of genuine understanding is often
not one’s lack of intelligence, but the presence of one’s pride. Thus:
‘The edifice of your pride has to be dismantled. And that is terribly
hard work.’14 The self-scrutiny demanded by such a dismantling of one’s
pride is necessary, not only to be a decent person, but also to write
decent philosophy. ‘If anyone is unwilling to descend into himself,
because this is too painful, he will remain superficial in his
writing’:15</p>
<p>Lying to oneself about oneself, deceiving yourself about the pretence
in your own state of will, must have a harmful influence on [one’s]
style; for the result will be that you cannot tell what is genuine in
the style and what is false …</p>
<p>If I perform to myself, then it’s this that the style expresses. And
then the style cannot be my own. If you are unwilling to know what you
are, your writing is a form of deceit.</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that Wittgenstein wrote the set of remarks with
which he remained most satisfied at a time when he was most ruthlessly
honest about himself – when he made the most intense efforts to ‘descend
into himself’ and admit to those occasions on which his pride had forced
him to be deceitful.</p>
<p>During the months in which he prepared the final formulation of the
beginning of his book, Wittgenstein also prepared a confession,
describing the times in his life when he had been weak and dishonest.
His intention was to read the confession out to members of his family
and to a number of his closest friends. He presumably felt that to admit
the deceit to himself was not enough; properly to ‘dismantle the pride’
that had given rise to his weakness would involve confession to other
people. It was, for him, a matter of the utmost importance, and
accordingly, in November 1936, he wrote to, among others, Maurice Drury,
G. E. Moore, Paul Engelmann, Fania Pascal and, of course, Francis
Skinner, telling them that he had to meet them some time during the
Christmas period. The only one of these letters to survive is the one to
Moore, although we can guess that the others were broadly similar. He
told Moore that, besides his work, ‘all sorts of things have been
happening inside me (I mean in my mind)’:16</p>
<p>I won’t write about them now, but when I come to Cambridge, as I
intend to do for a few days about the New Year, I hope to God I shall be
able to talk to you about them; and I shall then want your advice and
your help in some very difficult and serious matters.</p>
<p>To Francis he must have been a little more direct, telling him that
what he had in mind was to make a confession. In a letter of 6 December,
we find Francis promising: ‘Whatever you say to me can’t make any
difference to my love for you.17 I am terribly rotten in every way
myself.’ What was of more importance for Francis was that he would, at
last, be seeing Wittgenstein again: ‘I think of you a lot and of our
love for each other. This keeps me going and gives me cheerfulness and
helps me to get over despondency.’ Three days later he repeated the
promise: ‘Whatever you have to tell me about yourself can’t make any
difference to my love for you … There won’t be any question of my
forgiving you as I am a much worse person than you are.18 I think of you
a lot and love you always.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein spent Christmas in Vienna, and delivered the confession
to Engelmann, some members of his family and, probably, to some other
friends as well (surely, one would think, Hänsel must have been
included). None of these people left any record of what the confession
contained. When Engelmann published his letters from Wittgenstein he
omitted the one that mentioned the confession; in all probability, he
destroyed it. In the New Year Wittgenstein visited Cambridge and made
his confession to G. E. Moore, Maurice Drury, Fania Pascal, Rowland Hutt
and Francis.</p>
<p>Moore, Drury and Francis died without revealing the secret of what
the confession contained, and we therefore have only the recollections
of Pascal and Hutt to depend on. How the others reacted to the
confession we do not know, although Pascal most likely captures the
spirit of Drury’s and Moore’s responses when she remarks that, without
being told, she knows they: ‘listened patiently, said little, but showed
friendly participation, implying by manner and look that there was no
need for him to make this confession, but if he thought he should, well
and good, so be it’.19 According to Drury, however, he did not listen to
the confession, but read it. Drury adds that Moore had already read it,
and, according to Wittgenstein, had seemed very distressed at having to
do so. Other than this, Drury says nothing in his memoir about the
confession. As for Francis, Pascal is no doubt correct in speculating:
’He would have sat transfixed, profoundly affected, his eyes
undeviatingly on Wittgenstein.’20</p>
<p>For both Rowland Hutt and Fania Pascal, listening to the confession
was an uncomfortable experience. In Hutt’s case the discomfort was
simply embarrassment at having to sit in a Lyons café while opposite him
sat Wittgenstein reciting his sins in a loud and clear voice. Fania
Pascal, on the other hand, was exasperated by the whole thing.
Wittgenstein had phoned at an inconvenient moment to ask whether he
could come and see her. When she asked if it was urgent she was told
firmly that it was, and could not wait. ‘If ever a thing could wait’,
she thought, facing him across the table, ‘it is a confession of this
kind and made in this manner.’21 The stiff and remote way in which he
delivered his confession made it impossible for her to react with
sympathy. At one point she cried out: ‘What is it? You want to be
perfect?’ ‘Of course I want to be perfect’, he thundered.</p>
<p>Fania Pascal remembers two of the ‘sins’ confessed to by
Wittgenstein. As well as these, there were a number of more minor sins,
which elude her memory. Some of these have been remembered by Rowland
Hutt. One concerned the death of an American acquaintance of
Wittgenstein’s.22 Upon being told by a mutual friend of this death,
Wittgenstein reacted in a way that was appropriate to hearing sorrowful
news. This was disingenuous of him, because, in fact, it was not news to
him at all; he had already heard of the death. Another concerned an
incident in the First World War. Wittgenstein had been told by his
commanding officer to carry some bombs across an unsteady plank which
bridged a stream. He had, at first, been too afraid to do it. He
eventually overcame his fear, but his initial cowardice had haunted him
ever since. Yet another concerned the fact that, although most people
would have taken him to be a virgin, he was not so: as a young man he
had had sexual relations with a woman. Wittgenstein did not use the
words ‘virgin’ or ‘sexual relations’, but Hutt is in no doubt this is
what he meant. The actual words used by Wittgenstein have eluded his
memory. They were, he thinks, something like: ‘Most people would think
that I have had no relationship with women, but I have.’</p>
<p>The first of the ‘sins’ that Fania Pascal does remember was that
Wittgenstein had allowed most people who knew him to believe that he was
three-quarters Aryan and one-quarter Jewish, whereas, in fact, the
reverse was the case. That is to say, of Wittgenstein’s grandparents,
three were of Jewish descent. Under the Nuremberg Laws, this made
Wittgenstein himself a Jew, and Pascal is surely right in linking this
confession with the existence of Nazi Germany. What Wittgenstein did not
tell her, but what she subsequently discovered, was that not one of his
‘Jewish’ grandparents was actually a Jew. Two were baptized as
Protestants, and the third as a Roman Catholic. ‘Some Jew’, she
remarks.</p>
<p>So far, all these ‘crimes’ are sins of omission: they concern only
cases in which Wittgenstein failed to do something, or declined to
correct a misleading impression. The final, and most painful, sin
concerns an actual untruth told by Wittgenstein. At this stage in the
confession, Pascal recalls, ‘he had to keep a firmer control on himself,
telling in a clipped way of the cowardly and shameful manner in which he
had behaved’.23 Her account of this confession, however, gives a
strangely distorted impression of the incident she describes:</p>
<p>During the short period when he was teaching at a village school in
Austria, he hit a little girl in his class and hurt her (my memory is,
without details, of a physically violent act). When she ran to the
headmaster to complain, Wittgenstein denied he had done it. The event
stood out as a crisis of his early manhood. It may have been this that
made him give up teaching, perhaps made him realise that he ought to
live as a solitary.</p>
<p>This is distorted in a number of ways. First, Wittgenstein was in his
late thirties when the incident at Otterthal occurred, which is surely a
little old to be described as ‘early manhood’. More important, Pascal
seems to have had no idea that physically violent acts were, by all
accounts, a not infrequent occurrence in Wittgenstein’s classes, nor
that Wittgenstein actually stood trial before a court to answer charges
of violence. It is possible that Wittgenstein did not tell her these
things – that he used the isolated incident as a symbol of his
misdemeanours at Otterthal. But it is also possible – and I think not
unlikely – that Pascal’s memory is at fault. She was, after all, in no
mood to listen to Wittgenstein’s confession, and was further alienated
by his manner while delivering it. Rowland Hutt remembers the
confession, not as concerning a denial made to a headmaster about an
isolated incident, but rather as an admission to having told lies in a
court case. Put like this, it both squares better with the accounts
given by the Otterthal villagers and explains better why the deception
so haunted Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that of all the deceptions confessed to by
Wittgenstein, his behaviour at Otterthal was felt to be the greatest
burden, and he went to much greater lengths than Pascal and Hutt could
have known to relieve himself of it. In the same year in which he made
his confessions, Wittgenstein astounded the villagers of Otterthal by
appearing at their doorsteps to apologize personally to the children
whom he had physically hurt. He visited at least four of these children
(and possibly more), begging their pardon for his ill-conduct towards
them. Some of them responded generously, as the Otterthal villager Georg
Stangel recalls:</p>
<p>I myself was not a pupil of Wittgenstein’s, but I was present when
shortly before the war Wittgenstein visited my father’s house to
apologise to my brother and my father. Wittgenstein came at midday, at
about 1 o’clock, into the kitchen and asked me where Ignaz is.24 I
called my brother, my father was also present. Wittgenstein said that he
wanted to apologise if he had done him an injustice. Ignaz said that he
had no need to apologise, he had learnt well from Wittgenstein.
Wittgenstein stayed for about half an hour and mentioned that he also
wanted to go to Gansterer and Goldberg to beg their pardon in a similar
way.</p>
<p>But at the home of Mr Piribauer, who had instigated the action
against Wittgenstein, he received a less generous response. There he
made his apologies to Piribauer’s daughter Hermine, who bore a
deep-seated grudge against him for the times he had pulled her by the
ears and by the hair in such a violent fashion that, on occasion, her
ears had bled and her hair had come out. To Wittgenstein’s plea for
pardon, the girl responded only with a disdainful, ’Ja, ja.’25</p>
<p>One can imagine how humiliating this must have been for Wittgenstein.
And it might almost seem that the point of humbling himself in this way
was precisely that: to punish himself. But this, I think, would be to
misunderstand the purpose of his confessions and apologies. The point
was not to hurt his pride, as a form of punishment; it was to dismantle
it – to remove a barrier, as it were, that stood in the way of honest
and decent thought. If he felt he had wronged the children of Otterthal,
then he ought to apologize to them. The thought might have occurred to
anyone, but most people would entertain the idea and then dismiss it for
various reasons: it happened a long time ago; the villagers would not
understand such an apology, and would think it very strange; the journey
to Otterthal is difficult in winter; it would be painful and humiliating
to offer such an apology and, given the other reasons, not worth the
trouble; and so on. But to find these reasons compelling, as, I think,
most of us would, is in the end to submit to cowardice. And this, above
all else, is what Wittgenstein was steadfastly determined not to do. He
did not, that is, go to Otterthal to seek pain and humiliation, but
rather with the determination to go through with his apology despite
it.</p>
<p>In reflecting upon the effects of his confession he wrote:</p>
<p>Last year with God’s help I pulled myself together and made a
confession. This brought me into more settled waters, into a better
relation with people, and to a greater seriousness.26 But now it is as
though I had spent all that, and I am not far from where I was before. I
am cowardly beyond measure. If I do not correct this, I shall again
drift entirely into those waters through which I was moving then.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein regarded his confessions as a kind of surgery, an
operation to remove cowardice. Characteristically, he regarded the
infection as malignant and in need of continued treatment. It was
characteristic, too, for him to regard a mere physical injury as trivial
by comparison. Soon after he returned to Norway in the New Year of 1937
he suffered an accident and broke one of his ribs. Whereas his moral
condition had been a matter of urgency, this was simply brushed aside
with a joke. He told Pattisson: ’I thought of having it removed
andandandand of having a wife made of it, but they tell me that the art
of making women out of ribs has been lost.’27</p>
<p>If the confessions had any effect on Francis, it was possibly that of
emboldening him to speak his mind a bit more freely – to reveal some of
the things he had kept hidden. ‘I feel it is wrong to hide things from
you’, he wrote in March 1937, ‘even though I do so because I am ashamed
of myself.’ But in his case, it was not past deeds that he revealed, but
present feelings, and in particular the feeling that he did not want to
be in Cambridge working at the factory, but with Wittgenstein, and
preferably working with him: ‘I sometimes wish that we could do some
work together, any sort of work.28 I feel you are part of my life.’ What
worried him was not his own moral state (and certainly not
Wittgenstein’s), but their relationship – his fear that they were
growing apart or that they might be forced apart by circumstances:</p>
<p>I think a lot about our relation. Are we going to act independently
of each other, will I be able to act independently of you? What will
happen if there is a war? Or if we are permanently separated? I am so
terribly deficient in courage. I long for you often. I do feel you are
near me in whatever state of mind I am in, and would feel so even if I
did something very bad. I am always your old heart. I love to think
about you.</p>
<p>It was painful for Francis to think that he was no longer involved in
Wittgenstein’s work – to recognize that he was no longer in any sense
Wittgenstein’s collaborator. In May he wrote: ‘I don’t think I have ever
understood your present work thoroughly, and I think it would be good
for me to try and understand it better.’29 The letter contains a report
of a meeting with Sraffa, from which, he said, he had ‘learnt a lot and
it had done me good’. Sraffa had: ‘talked in a very nice way about
working men’. But, as a working man himself, Francis was beginning to
find, to his great consternation, that the problems of philosophy seemed
rather remote to him now:</p>
<p>I have been trying to think lately about what use philosophy is to me
now. I don’t want to lose my intellectual conscience. I want to make
some use of all those years I spent learning philosophy. I don’t want
now just to have been made a cleverer person. I want to keep in mind the
importance of trying to use words correctly… I think also I ought not to
forget that philosophical problems are really important problems to
me.</p>
<p>This letter, dated 27 May, was written to Wittgenstein in Vienna. His
work in Norway during the spring of 1937 had gone badly – ‘partly’, he
told Moore, ‘because I’ve been troubled about myself a lot’, and he
spent the summer, first with his family, and then in East Road with
Francis. At Cambridge he undertook work that, presumably, Francis could
help him with: he dictated a typescript of the remarks, written the
previous winter, that now form the first 188 paragraphs of Philosophical
Investigations.30 On 10 August he left again for Norway.</p>
<p>That Wittgenstein returned to Norway full of trepidation is apparent
from his diary entries of this period. On the ship to Skjolden he notes
that he has managed to write a little, but that his mind is not
‘wholeheartedly’ on his work. A few days later he describes himself as:
‘vain, thoughtless, anxious’ – anxious, that is, about living alone.31
‘Am afraid I will be depressed and not able to work’:</p>
<p>I would now like to live with somebody. To see a human face in the
morning. – On the other hand, I have now become so soft, that it would
perhaps be good for me to have to live alone. Am now extraordinarily
contemptible.</p>
<p>‘I have the feeling’, he writes, ‘that I would not be completely
without ideas, but that the solitude will depress me, that I will not be
able to work. I am afraid that in my house all my thoughts will be
killed off, that there a spirit of despondency will take complete
possession of me.’ But where else could he work? The idea of living in
Skjolden but not in his house disturbed him, and in Cambridge, ‘I could
teach, but not write as well.’ The following day he was: ‘unhappy,
helpless and thoughtless’, and it occurred to him: ‘how unique and
irreplaceable Francis is.32 And yet how little I realise this when I am
with him’:</p>
<p>Am completely ensnared in pettiness. Am irritable, think only of
myself, that my life is wretched, and at the same time I have no idea of
how wretched it is.</p>
<p>He could not face moving back into his house. His room, which before
had seemed charming, now struck him as alien and unfriendly. He took
lodgings instead with Anna Rebni, but in so doing he had to wrestle with
his conscience. It struck him as ‘weird’ (unheimlich) that he should
live with her and leave his own house standing empty: ‘I am ashamed to
have this house and not to live in it.33 It is, however, strange that
this shame should be such a powerful feeling.’ After a night at Rebni’s
house, he wrote that he felt strange being there: ‘I do not know whether
I have either a right or any good reason to live here.34 I have neither
any real need for solitude nor any overpowering urge to work.’ He felt
weak at the knees. ‘Is it the climate?? – It is terrible how easily I am
overcome by anxiety [die Sorge].’ He thought of moving back to his own
house, ‘but I am frightened of the sadness that can overcome me there’.
It is difficult, he wrote, to walk uphill, and one does it only
reluctantly. He himself felt too weak to make the effort. He was, for a
day or two, inclined to think that the trouble was physical rather than
psychological. ‘Am now really ill’, he wrote on 22 August, ‘abdominal
pains and temperature.’35 The following evening, however, he recorded
that his temperature was normal, but that he felt as tired as ever. It
was not until 26 August that he recorded the first sign of recovery: he
was able once more to look at the Norwegian scenery with pleasure. He
had that day received two letters (‘showered with gifts’ as he put it) –
one from Francis and another from Drury, ‘both stirringly lovely’.36 On
the same day he finally – a year after he had first gone to live in
Norway – wrote to Francis to invite him to join him. ‘May it go well.
And may it be given to me to be halfway decent.’</p>
<p>Francis accepted the invitation with alacrity. On 23 August he had
written: ‘You said in one of your letters “I wish I had you here”.37
Would I be of any help to you if I could come to see you? You know I
would come and would love to come.’ Now: ‘I would love very much to come
and see you.38 I definitely think it would do me good. I’m quite sure of
it.’ Owing, however, to a blister on his leg that had to be operated on,
it was not until the third week of September that he was able to
travel.</p>
<p>During this time Wittgenstein gradually recovered his mental
stability and his ability to work, and was able to move back into his
house. ‘The way to solve the problem you see in life’, he wrote on 27
August, ‘is to live in a way that will make what is problematic
disappear’:39</p>
<p>The fact that life is problematic shows that the shape of your life
does not fit into life’s mould. So you must change the way you live and,
once your life does fit into the mould, what is problematic will
disappear.</p>
<p>But don’t we have the feeling that someone who sees no problem in
life is blind to something important, even to the most important thing
of all? Don’t I feel like saying that a man like that is just living
aimlessly – blindly, like a mole, and that if only he could see, he
would see the problem?</p>
<p>Or shouldn’t I say rather: a man who lives rightly won’t experience
the problem as sorrow, so for him it will be a bright halo round his
life, not a dubious background.</p>
<p>In these terms Wittgenstein saw himself as neither blind, nor one who
lives rightly. He felt the problem of life as a problem, as sorrow.
Inevitably, he identified the problem as himself: ‘I conduct myself
badly and have mean and shabby feelings and thoughts’40 (26.8.37); ‘I am
a coward, that I notice again and again, on all sorts of occasions’41
(2.9.37); ‘Am irreligious, but with Angst’ (7.9.37).42 The ‘but’ in the
last sentence seems to have been some reassurance, as though if he felt
his lack of faith with anxiety, that at least proved that he was not
living blindly – it gave him at least the possibility of living ‘with a
bright halo round his life’. On 4 September he wrote:</p>
<p>Christianity is not a doctrine, not, I mean, a theory about what has
happened and will happen to the human soul, but a description of
something that actually takes place in human life.43 For ‘consciousness
of sin’ is a real event and so are despair and salvation through faith.
Those who speak of such things (Bunyan for instance) are simply
describing what has happened to them, whatever gloss anyone may want to
put on it.</p>
<p>It was, as ever, the God within himself that he sought – the
transformation of his own despair into faith. He chastized himself when,
during the violent storms of the following few days, he found himself
tempted to curse God. It was, he told himself, ‘just wicked and
superstitious’.44</p>
<p>By 11 September Wittgenstein’s ability to work had revived
sufficiently for him to start writing into one of his large manuscript
volumes (rather than his notebooks), but he was frightened, he said,
that he would write ‘in a stilted and bad style’. He found he could just
about manage to work, but he could find no pleasure in so doing: ‘It’s
as though my work had been drained of its juice’, he wrote on 17
September.45</p>
<p>The following day he travelled to Bergen to meet Francis. He felt, he
wrote, very sensual: in the night, when he could not sleep, he had
sensual fantasies. A year ago he had been much more decent – more
serious. After Francis had arrived at the house, Wittgenstein was
‘sensual, susceptible, indecent’46 with him: ‘Lay with him two or three
times. Always at first with the feeling that there was nothing wrong in
it, then with shame.47 Have also been unjust, edgy and insincere towards
him, and also cruel.’ Whether this was the only occasion on which he and
Francis were sexually intimate, we do not know. It is certainly the only
occasion mentioned in his coded remarks. What is striking is the
juxtaposition of his account of their lying together with observations
of his lovelessness towards Francis. Or perhaps what he is expressing is
his fear of becoming loveless, as though he expected to find that
Weininger was right when he wrote: ‘physical contact with the beloved
object, in which the sexual impulse is awakened … suffices to kill love
on the spot’.</p>
<p>During the ten days or so that Francis stayed at Wittgenstein’s house
there is only one coded remark: ‘Am very impatient!’ (25.9.37) On 1
October, the day that Francis left, however, he wrote:48</p>
<p>The last 5 days were nice: he settled into the life here and did
everything with love and kindness, and I was, thank God, not impatient,
and truly I had no reason to be, except for my own rotten nature.49
Yesterday I accompanied him as far as Sogndal; returned today to my hut.
Somewhat depressed, also tired.</p>
<p>For Francis, of course, the sensuality and the intimacy of their
first night together in Wittgenstein’s house had no Weiningerian
connotations. He could give himself over to his ‘susceptibility’ to
Wittgenstein without any fear of losing his love. In an undated letter,
for example, he writes: ‘I often remember all the things we have done
together in the past and also the things we did here in Cambridge.50
This makes me long for you sometimes very violently’; and his letters
immediately after his visit to Norway are repetitious in their
affirmation of how ‘wonderful’ the visit had been:</p>
<p>I think constantly of you and of the wonderful time I have had with
you.51 It was wonderful that it was possible. It was so lovely being
with you and living in the house with you. It was a wonderful gift to
us. I hope it will do me a lot of good. [undated]</p>
<p>I am often thinking now how good I felt when I was with you and how
wonderful it was being with you and looking at the landscape with you.52
You were most wonderfully good to me. It has done me a lot of good being
with you … It was wonderful being with you. [14.10.37]</p>
<p>During his stay, Francis had helped Wittgenstein clean his room, just
as he had longed to do a year earlier. Wittgenstein’s horror of
uncleanliness impelled him to adopt a particularly rigorous method of
cleaning his floor: he would throw wet tea-leaves over it, to soak up
the dirt, and then sweep them up. He performed this task frequently
wherever he stayed, and resolutely refused to have a carpet in any room
that he lived in for any length of time. When Francis returned to his
flat in East Road he adopted this fastidiousness as a sort of memento of
his stay:</p>
<p>I’m thinking of you a lot. I also think often how lovely it was
cleaning your room with you.53 When I got back I decided I wouldn’t put
my carpet down even though it had been beaten because I know I can’t
keep it properly clean. I now have to sweep my room. I like to do it
because it reminds me of when I was with you. I’m glad I learnt how to
do it properly then.</p>
<p>Francis also put on Wittgenstein’s mantle when he attended a meeting
of the Moral Science Club. In his report of the meeting he eschews the
modest and mild tone of almost all his other recorded utterances, and
displays an uncharacteristic fierceness, borrowed, one suspects, from
Wittgenstein:</p>
<p>Prof. Moore wasn’t present and Braithwaite took the chair.54 The
paper was on ethics. I must say I thought Braithwaite was most revolting
in the discussion. He took away all the seriousness from it. He never
talked as if he had any responsibility for the discussion, or as if the
discussion had a serious purpose. There was constant laughter throughout
the discussion, a good deal of it provoked by him. I wouldn’t have
minded if what he had said had just been bad but I hated his lack of
seriousness. This prevents anything useful and valuable coming from the
discussion.</p>
<p>In his diary Wittgenstein describes this as a ‘lovely letter from
Fr.’:55</p>
<p>He writes … how miserably bad the discussion was under Braithwaite’s
chairmanship. It is dreadful. But I wouldn’t know what to do about it,
for the other people are not serious enough either. Also, I would be too
cowardly to do anything decisive.</p>
<p>In another letter, Francis mentions, in a similarly disapproving
manner, Fania Pascal’s lectures on ‘Modern Europe’, a course on current
events that she had agreed to give to the Workers’ Educational
Association. Here Wittgenstein did attempt a decisive intervention: he
wrote Pascal what she describes as a ‘harsh and hectoring’ letter, which
‘caused the greatest explosion of fury on my part, a fury that rankled
the more since I would not dare to express it to him’.56 Wittgenstein
wrote that she must on no account give the course – that it was wrong
for her, it was evil and damaging. Why he thought this, and what exactly
the letter said, we will never know; Pascal tore it up in a fit of
anger.</p>
<p>The first of Francis’s letters did not reach Wittgenstein until about
two weeks after Francis had left Skjolden. This, though not an
extraordinarily long delay, was enough to confirm his fears. On 16
October he wrote: ‘Have not heard from Francis for about 12 days and am
rather worried, because he has not yet written from England.57 God, how
much misery and wretchedness there is in this world.’ The next day he
received the first letter: ’Am relieved and gladdened. God may help
us.’58</p>
<p>In the meantime, he had received a short visit from Ludwig Hänsel’s
son, Hermann: ‘He made a good impression.59 I have no very close
relationship with him, because he is rough-grained [grobkörnig] and I am
not entirely suited to rough-grained people.’ But, though the grain was
rough, the wood was good, Hänsel, ‘who is much more decent than I’,
showed him what a shabby person he was: ‘how worried I am that something
will corrupt me; how annoyed if the slightest thing is ruined’. He
worried that he might lose his energy for work, his imagination. Images
of decay impressed themselves upon him:</p>
<p>[I] just took some apples out of a paper bag where they had been
lying for a long time.60 I had to cut half off many of them and throw it
away. Afterwards when I was copying out a sentence I had written, the
second half of which was bad, I at once saw it as a half-rotten
apple.</p>
<p>And was there not, he asked himself, something feminine about this
way of thinking, whereby: ‘Everything that comes my way becomes a
picture for me of what I am thinking about at the time.’ It was as
though, in Weininger’s terms, he had relapsed into thinking in henids
rather than in concepts.</p>
<p>Throughout November and December, his last two months in Norway,
Wittgenstein’s diary is full of the fears, anxieties and unpleasant
thoughts that assailed him. He thought about illness and death – his
own, his friends’ and his family’s. He worried that something would
happen to him before he could leave. He fretted about his relationship
with Anna Rebni, and about what he would do after he had left Norway.
Would his book be finished by then? Would he be able to work on his own
again, or should he go somewhere where he could be with someone –
perhaps to Dublin, to Drury?</p>
<p>He worried, too, about his sensuality and his ability to love. He
recorded the occasions on which he masturbated, sometimes with shame,
and sometimes with bewildered doubt: ’How bad is it? I don’t know. I
guess it is bad, but I have no reason to think so.’61 Was his ability to
love, with a clean and pure heart, threatened by the sexual desire
manifested in his urge to masturbate?</p>
<p>Think of my earlier love, or infatuation, for Marguerite and of my
love for Francis.62 It is a bad sign for me that my feelings for M could
go so completely cold. To be sure, there is a difference here; but still
my coldheartedness remains. May I be forgiven; i.e., may it be possible
for me, to be sincere and loving, [1.12.37]</p>
<p>Masturbated last night.63 Pangs of conscience. But also the
conviction that I am too weak to withstand the urge and the temptation
if they and the images which accompany them offer themselves to me
without my being able to take refuge in others. Yet only yesterday
evening I was reflecting on the need to lead a pure life. (I was
thinking of Marguerite and Francis.) [2.12.37]</p>
<p>Throughout all these worries, anxieties and fears, he tried to work
on his book. During these months he wrote most of the remarks that now
form Part I of Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, although at
the time of writing he intended them to form the second half of the work
he had written the previous year. The remarks are an application of the
method described in the earlier work to the problems in the philosophy
of mathematics, trying to show that these problems arise out of ‘the
bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language’. In particular, he
uses his ‘anthropological’ method in an attempt to dissolve the way of
thinking that gave rise to the logicism of Frege and Russell.64 By
imagining tribes with conventions or ways of reasoning different to our
own, and by constructing metaphors different to ones commonly employed,
he tries to weaken the hold of certain analogies, certain ‘similes that
have been absorbed into the forms of our language’. He attacks, for
example, the Platonism that regards logical propositions as analogous to
factual propositions. ‘Isn’t there a truth corresponding to logical
inference?’ he makes his interlocutor ask.65 ‘Isn’t it true that this
follows from that?’ Well, replies Wittgenstein, what would happen if we
made a different inference? How would we get into conflict with the
truth?</p>
<p>How should we get into conflict with truth, if our footrules were
made of very soft rubber instead of wood and steel? – ‘Well, we
shouldn’t get to know the correct measurement of the table.’ – You mean:
we should not get, or could not be sure of getting, that measurement
which we get with our rigid rulers.</p>
<p>The point here is that the criteria for correct or incorrect
reasoning are not provided by some external realm of Platonic truths,
but, rather, by ourselves, by ‘a convention, or a use, and perhaps our
practical requirements’. The convention of using rigid rulers rather
than floppy ones is not truer; it is simply more useful.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein also attacks the simile that lies at the heart of
logicism: the analogy between a mathematical proof and a logical
argument. In a logical argument, connections are made between various
(empirical) propositions, with the intention of establishing the truth
of a conclusion: All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore
Socrates is mortal. The result of a mathematical proof, on the other
hand, is never the truth of an empirical proposition, but the
establishing of a generally applicable rule. In this particular assault,
Wittgenstein had to show the disanalogy between mathematical and
empirical propositions, but his remarks on this point are less than
completely satisfying. Occasionally his own dissatisfaction is
acknowledged in the body of the text: ’I am merely – in an unskilful
fashion – pointing to the fundamental difference, together with an
apparent similarity, between the roles of an arithmetical proposition
and an empirical proposition.’66 He was never happy with his
presentation of this point, or with his treatment of other issues in the
philosophy of mathematics, and over the next six years was to attempt to
improve on it again and again.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was dissatisfied with this work as he was writing it. In
his diary he criticizes it often, and severely. The style, he says
repeatedly, is bad, too uncertain, and he has constantly to cross out
and change what he has written: ‘I am nervous when writing and all my
thoughts are short of breath.67 And I feel constantly that I cannot
completely justify the expression. That it tastes bad.’ This is
indicative of his own nervousness, and of the fact that he got so little
sleep and had been so long without seeing the sun. The weather was
upsetting him; it was too cold. The fjord was already completely frozen,
and the lake was beginning to ice over as well. He could no longer row,
but had to walk across the ice, and this, too, worried him. He began to
count the days until he could leave to go to Vienna for Christmas. Of
course, he could leave at any time, but would this be right?</p>
<p>I would like to flee, but that would be wrong and I simply can’t do
it.68 On the other hand, perhaps I could – I could pack tomorrow and
leave the next day. But would I want to? Would it be right? Is it not
right to stick it out here? Sure. I would leave tomorrow with a bad
feeling. ‘Stick it out’, a voice says to me. There is also some vanity
in this desire to stick it out, but something better as well. – The only
cogent reason to leave here any earlier or at once would be that now I
could perhaps work better somewhere else. For it is a fact that the
pressure I am under at the moment makes it almost impossible for me to
work and perhaps in a few more days really impossible.</p>
<p>When, during the following few days, he was able to work again, he
thanked God for a gift he did not deserve. He always felt, he wrote,
what a truly devout person never feels – that God was responsible for
what he was: ‘It is the opposite of piety.69 Again and again I want to
say: “God, if you do not help me, what can I do?”’ And although this
attitude accords with what the Bible teaches, it is not that of a truly
devout man, for such a one would assume responsibility for himself. ‘You
must strive’, he urged himself; ’never mind God.’70</p>
<p>Despite these urgings, he remained ‘sensual, weak and mean’, and
subject to all the old anxieties – that he would not be able to leave
because something would happen to him, that he would become ill or have
an accident on the way home. He was troubled, too, by all the problems
of spending the winter in Norway that Russell had pointed out in 1913:
‘The ever-changing, difficult weather, cold, snow, sheet ice, etc.,71
and the darkness and my exhaustion make everything very difficult.’ He
was sent, of course, encouragement and loving concern from Francis:</p>
<p>I’m sorry you are having storms. Please be very careful about going
across the lake.72 I will be thinking about you a great deal. I love to
remember our time together in Norway. It does me good to think about
it.</p>
<p>But when his last night in Norway came, on 10 December, he greeted it
with some relief, writing that it was perfectly possible that he would
never return.</p>
<p>On the ship to Bergen Wittgenstein wrote of Christ’s Resurrection and
of what inclined even him to believe in it. If Christ did not rise from
the dead, he reasoned, then he decomposed in the grave like any other
man. ‘He is dead and decomposed.’73 He had to repeat and underline the
thought to appreciate its awfulness. For if that were the case, then
Christ was a teacher like any other, ‘and can no longer help; and once
more we are orphaned and alone. So we have to content ourselves with
wisdom and speculation.’ And if that is all we have, then: ‘We are in a
sort of hell where we can do nothing but dream, roofed in, as it were,
and cut off from heaven.’ If he wanted to be saved, to be redeemed, then
wisdom was not enough; he needed faith:</p>
<p>And faith is faith in what is needed by my heart, my soul, not my
speculative intelligence. For it is my soul with its passions, as it
were with its flesh and blood, that has to be saved, not my abstract
mind. Perhaps we can say: Only love can believe the Resurrection. Or: it
is love that believes the Resurrection. We might say: Redeeming love
believes even in the Resurrection; holds fast even to the
Resurrection.</p>
<p>Ultimately, then, perhaps what he needed to do to escape the hell of
being alone was to love; if he could do this, then he could overcome his
doubts, believe in the Resurrection, and thus be saved. Or, perhaps, it
was that he needed first to be loved, by God:</p>
<p>What combats doubts is, as it were, redemption. Holding fast to this
must be holding fast to that belief. So what that means is: first you
must be redeemed and hold on to your redemption – then you will see that
you are holding fast to this belief.</p>
<p>First, you must be redeemed: ‘Then everything will be different and
it will be “no wonder” if you can do things that you cannot do now.’
Such as: believing in the Resurrection. So, it seems, belief in the
Resurrection is necessary for salvation, but salvation is needed to
believe in the Resurrection. Who is to break the vicious circle: himself
or God?</p>
<p>As he escaped the hell of being alone in Norway, Wittgenstein seemed
to be saying that his escape from the wider hell, from the greater
aloneness, was God’s responsibility.</p>
