<h4 id="the-verifications-phase">12 THE ‘VERIFICATIONS PHASE’</h4>
<p>TOWARDS THE END of 1929 Wittgenstein might have gained some hint of
Marguerite’s ambivalence about their relationship, and of her doubts
about marrying him, when, shortly after he arrived in Vienna to spend
Christmas with her and with his family, she announced that she no longer
wished to kiss him. Her feelings for him, she explained, were not of the
appropriate kind. Wittgenstein did not take the hint. In his diary notes
he does not pause to reflect on her feelings, but dwells, rather, on his
own. He found it painful, he admitted, but at the same time he was not
unhappy about it. For, really, everything depended on his spiritual
state rather than on the satisfaction of his sensual desires. ‘For if
the spirit does not abandon me, then nothing that happens is dirty and
petty.’1 ‘I will, however’, he added, ‘have to stand on tiptoe a great
deal if I do not want to go under.’ The problem, as he saw it, was not
to win her over but to conquer his own desires. ‘I am a beast and am
still not unhappy about it’, he wrote on Christmas Day.2 ‘I am in danger
of becoming still more superficial. May God prevent it!’</p>
<p>As a technique for avoiding this tendency, or perhaps in order to
reveal it, he conceived the idea of writing an autobiography. And here
again, everything depended on the spirit. On 28 December he wrote:</p>
<p>The spirit in which one can write the truth about oneself can take
the most varied forms; from the most decent to the most indecent.3 And
accordingly it is very desirable or very wrong for it to be written.
Indeed, among the true autobiographies that one might write there are
all the gradations from the highest to the lowest. I for instance cannot
write my biography on a higher plane than I exist on. And by the very
fact of writing it I do not necessarily enhance myself; I may thereby
even make myself dirtier than I was in the first place. Something inside
me speaks in favour of my writing my biography, and in fact I would like
some time to spread out my life clearly, in order to have it clearly in
front of me, and for others too. Not so much to put it on trial as to
produce, in any case, clarity and truth.</p>
<p>Nothing came of this plan, although for the next two or three years
he continued to make notes that attempted to expose the ‘naked truth’
about himself and to reflect upon the nature of a worthwhile
autobiography.</p>
<p>Any autobiography he might have written would almost certainly have
had more in common with St Augustine’s Confessions than with, say,
Bertrand Russell’s Autobiography. The writing of it would, that is, have
been fundamentally a spiritual act. He considered Confessions to be
possibly ‘the most serious book ever written’.4 He was particularly fond
of quoting a passage from Book I, which reads: ‘Yet woe betide those who
are silent about you! For even those who are most gifted with speech
cannot find words to describe you’, but which Wittgenstein, in
discussing it with Drury, preferred to render: ’And woe to those who say
nothing concerning thee just because the chatterboxes talk a lot of
nonsense.’5</p>
<p>In conversation with Waismann and Schlick the text was translated
even more freely: ‘What, you swine, you want not to talk nonsense! Go
ahead and talk nonsense, it does not matter!’ These free translations,
even if they fail to capture Augustine’s intended meaning, certainly
capture Wittgenstein’s view.6 One should put a stop to the nonsense of
chatterboxes, but that does not mean that one should refuse to talk
nonsense oneself. Everything, as always, depends on the spirit in which
one does it.</p>
<p>To Waismann and Schlick he repeated the general lines of his lecture
on ethics: ethics is an attempt to say something that cannot be said, a
running up against the limits of language. ‘I think it is definitely
important to put an end to all the claptrap about ethics – whether
intuitive knowledge exists, whether values exist, whether the good is
definable.’7 On the other hand, it is equally important to see that
something was indicated by the inclination to talk nonsense. He could
imagine, he said, what Heidegger, for example, means by anxiety and
being (in such statements as: ‘That in the face of which one has anxiety
is Being-in-the-world as such’), and he sympathized too with
Kierkegaard’s talk of ‘this unknown something with which the Reason
collides when inspired by its paradoxical passion’.</p>
<p>St Augustine, Heidegger, Kierkegaard – these are not names one
expects to hear mentioned in conversations with the Vienna Circle –
except as targets of abuse. Heidegger’s work, for example, was used
frequently by logical positivists to provide examples of the sort of
thing they meant by metaphysical nonsense – the sort of thing they
intended to condemn to the philosophical scrapheap.</p>
<p>While Wittgenstein had been in Cambridge, the Circle had formed
itself into a self-consciously cohesive group and had made the
anti-metaphysical stance that united them the basis for a kind of
manifesto, which was published under the title, Die Wissenschaftliche
Weltauffassung: Der Wiener Kreis (‘The Scientific View of the World: The
Vienna Circle’). The book was prepared and published as a gesture of
gratitude to Schlick, who was acknowledged as the leader of the group
and who had that year rejected an offer to go to Berlin in order to stay
with his friends and colleagues in Vienna. On hearing of the project,
Wittgenstein wrote to Waismann to express his disapproval:</p>
<p>Just because Schlick is no ordinary man, people owe it to him to take
care not to let their ‘good intentions’ make him and the Vienna school
which he leads ridiculous by boastfulness.8 When I say ‘boastfulness’ I
mean any kind of self-satisfied posturing. ‘Renunciation of
metaphysics!’ As if that were something new! What the Vienna school has
achieved, it ought to show not say … The master should be known by his
work.</p>
<p>Apart from an outline of the central tenets of the Circle’s doctrine,
their manifesto also contained an announcement of a forthcoming book by
Waismann entitled Logik, Sprache, Philosophie, which was then described
as an introduction to the ideas of the Tractatus. Despite his misgivings
about the manifesto, Wittgenstein agreed to co-operate with the book and
to meet regularly with Waismann to explain his ideas.</p>
<p>The discussions were held at Schlick’s house. Waismann took fairly
complete notes of what Wittgenstein said, partly to use for his
projected book and partly in order to keep the other members of the
Vienna Circle (whom Wittgenstein refused to meet) informed about
Wittgenstein’s latest thoughts. These members then quoted Wittgenstein’s
ideas in their own papers at philosophical conferences etc. In this way
Wittgenstein established a reputation as an influential but somewhat
shadowy contributor to Austrian philosophical debate. Among some
Austrian philosophers there was even speculation that this ‘Dr
Wittgenstein’, about whom they heard a great deal but of whom they saw
nothing, was no more than a figment of Schlick’s imagination, a
mythological character invented as a figurehead for the Circle.</p>
<p>What neither Schlick nor Waismann – still less the other members of
the Circle – appreciated in 1929 was how quickly and radically
Wittgenstein’s ideas were moving away from those of the Tractatus. In
the ensuing years the conception of Waismann’s book was forced to
undergo fundamental changes: from its intended beginnings as an
exposition of the ideas of the Tractatus, it became first a summary of
Wittgenstein’s modifications of those ideas, and then, finally, a
statement of Wittgenstein’s entirely new thoughts. After it had reached
this final manifestation, Wittgenstein withdrew his co-operation, and
the book was never published.fn1</p>
<p>In his discussions with Schlick and Waismann during the Christmas
vacation, Wittgenstein outlined some of the ways in which his views had
changed since he had written the Tractatus. He explained to them his
conviction that the Tractatus account of elementary propositions was
mistaken, and had to be abandoned – and, with it, his earlier view of
logical inference:</p>
<p>… at that time I thought that all inference was based on tautological
form. At that time I had not seen that an inference can also have the
form: This man is 2m tall, therefore he is not 3m tall.9</p>
<p>‘What was wrong about my conception’, he told them, ‘was that I
believed that the syntax of logical constants could be laid down without
paying attention to the inner connection of propositions.’ He now
realized, though, that the rules for the logical constants form only a
part of ‘a more comprehensive syntax about which I did not yet know
anything at the time’. His philosophical task now lay in describing this
more complicated syntax, and in making clear the role of ‘internal
connections’ in inference.</p>
<p>His thoughts on how he was to accomplish this task were, at this
time, in a state of flux, changing from one week to the next, and even
from one day to the next. A feature of these conversations is how often
Wittgenstein begins his remarks with comments like ‘I used to believe
…’, ‘I have to correct my account …’, ‘I was wrong when I presented the
matter in this way …’, referring, not to positions he had taken in the
Tractatus, but to views he had expressed earlier in the year, or,
perhaps, earlier in the week.</p>
<p>As an example of what he meant by ‘syntax’ and of the internal
connections it established, he imagined someone’s saying: ‘There is a
circle. Its length is 3cm and its width is 2cm.’ To this, he says, we
could only reply: ‘Indeed! What do you mean by a circle then?’ In other
words, the possibility of a circle that is longer than it is wide is
ruled out by what we mean by the word ‘circle’. These rules are provided
by the syntax, or, as Wittgenstein also says, the ‘grammar’ of our
language, which in this case establishes an ‘internal connection’
between something’s being a circle and its having only one radius.10</p>
<p>The syntax of geometrical terms prohibits, a priori, the existence of
such circles, just as the syntax of our colour words rules out the
possibility of a thing’s being both red and blue. The internal
connections set up by these different grammars allow the kind of
inferences that had eluded analysis in terms of the tautologies of the
Tractatus, because each of them forms a system:</p>
<p>Once I wrote [TLP 2.1512], ‘A proposition is laid against reality
like a ruler…’ I now prefer to say that a system of propositions is laid
against reality like a ruler. What I mean by this is the following.11 If
I lay a ruler against a spatial object, I lay all the graduating lines
against it at the same time.</p>
<p>If we measure an object to be ten inches, we can also infer
immediately that it is not eleven inches etc.</p>
<p>In describing the syntax of these systems of propositions,
Wittgenstein was coming close to, as Ramsey had put it, outlining
certain ‘necessary properties of space, time, and matter’. Was he, then,
in some sense, doing physics? No, he replies, physics is concerned with
determining the truth or falsity of states of affairs; he was concerned
with distinguishing sense from nonsense. ‘This circle is 3 cm long and 2
cm wide’ is not false, but nonsensical. The properties of space, time
and matter that he was concerned with were not the subject of a physical
investigation, but, as he was inclined to put it at this time, a
phenomenological analysis. ‘Physics’, he said, ‘does not yield a
description of the structure of phenomenological states of affairs.12 In
phenomenology it is always a matter of possibility, i.e. of sense, not
of truth and falsity.’</p>
<p>This way of putting things had, for Schlick, an uncomfortably Kantian
ring. It almost sounded as if Wittgenstein were attempting, à la The
Critique of Pure Reason, to describe the general and necessary features
of the ‘structure of appearance’, and was being led along the road that
led to Husserl. With Husserl’s phenomenology in mind, he asked
Wittgenstein: ‘What answer can one give to a philosopher who believes
that the statements of phenomenology are synthetic a priori
judgements?’13 To this Wittgenstein replied enigmatically: ‘I would
reply that it is indeed possible to make up words, but I cannot
associate a thought with them.’ In a remark written at about this time
he is more explicit: his view that there are indeed grammatical rules
that are not replaceable by tautologies (e.g. arithmetical equations)
‘explains – I believe – what Kant means when he insists that 7 + 5 = 12
is not an analytic proposition, but synthetic a priori’.14 In other
words, his answer is the familiar one that his investigations show what
Kant and the Kantians have tried to say.</p>
<p>Though disturbed by this pseudo-Kantian strain in Wittgenstein’s new
reflections, Schlick and (therefore) the other members of the Vienna
Circle took comparatively little notice of it. More congenial to the
empiricist tenor of their thinking was another point expressed by
Wittgenstein in the course of these conversations. This was that, if a
proposition is to have a meaning, if it is to say something, we must
have some idea of what would be the case if it were true. And therefore
we must have some means of establishing its truth or falsity. This
became known to the Vienna Circle as ‘Wittgenstein’s Principle of
Verification’, and so enthusiastically was it adopted by the members of
the Circle that it has been regarded ever since as the very essence of
logical positivism. In English it received its best-known and most
strident statement in A. J. Ayer’s Language, Truth and Logic (a title
inspired – if that is the word – by Waismann’s Logik, Sprache,
Philosophie ), which was published in 1936 and was written after Ayer
had spent some time in Vienna sitting in on meetings of the Circle.</p>
<p>The principle is expressed in the slogan: The sense of a proposition
is its means of verification; and it was explained by Wittgenstein to
Schlick and Waismann as follows:</p>
<p>If I say, for example, ‘Up there on the cupboard there is a book’,
how do I set about verifying it? Is it sufficient if I glance at it, or
if I look at it from different sides, or if I take it into my hands,
touch it, open it, turn over its leaves, and so forth? There are two
conceptions here.15 One of them says that however I set about it, I
shall never be able to verify the proposition completely. A proposition
always keeps a back-door open, as it were. Whatever we do, we are never
sure that we are not mistaken.</p>
<p>The other conception, the one I want to hold, says, ‘No, if I can
never verify the sense of a proposition completely, then I cannot have
meant anything by the proposition either. Then the proposition signifies
nothing whatsoever.’</p>
<p>In order to determine the sense of a proposition, I should have to
know a very specific procedure for when to count the proposition as
verified.</p>
<p>Later, Wittgenstein denied that he had ever intended this principle
to be the foundation of a Theory of Meaning, and distanced himself from
the dogmatic application of it by the logical positivists. He told a
meeting of the Moral Science Club in Cambridge:</p>
<p>I used at one time to say that, in order to get clear how a sentence
is used, it was a good idea to ask oneself the question: ‘How would one
try to verify such an assertion?’ But that’s just one way among others
of getting clear about the use of a word or sentence.16 For example,
another question which it is often very useful to ask oneself is: ‘How
is this word learned?’ ‘How would one set about teaching a child to use
this word?’ But some people have turned this suggestion about asking for
the verification into a dogma – as if I’d been advancing a theory about
meaning.</p>
<p>When, in the early 1930s, he was asked by G. F. Stout about his views
on verification, Wittgenstein told the following parable, the point of
which seems to be that discovering that a sentence has no means of
verification is to understand something important about it, but not to
discover that there is nothing in it to understand:</p>
<p>Imagine that there is a town in which the policemen are required to
obtain information from each inhabitant, e.g. his age, where he came
from, and what work he does.17 A record is kept of this information and
some use is made of it. Occasionally when a policeman questions an
inhabitant he discovers that the latter does not do any work. The
policeman enters this fact on the record, because this too is a useful
piece of information about the man!</p>
<p>And yet, despite these later disavowals, throughout 1930 – in his
conversations with Schlick and Waismann, in a list of ‘Theses’ dictated
to Waismann, and in his own notebooks – we find the principle expressed
by Wittgenstein in formulations that sound every bit as dogmatic as
those of the Vienna Circle and of Ayer: ‘The sense of a proposition is
the way it is verified’, ‘How a proposition is verified is what it says
… The verification is not one token of the truth, it is the sense of the
proposition’, and so on. We can, it seems, talk of a ‘Verificationist
Phase’ of Wittgenstein’s thought. But only if we distance the
verification principle from the logical empiricism of Schlick, Carnap,
Ayer etc, and place it within the more Kantian framework of
Wittgenstein’s ‘phenomenological’, or ‘grammatical’, investigations.</p>
<p>In the new year of 1930 Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge to find
that Frank Ramsey was seriously ill. He had suffered a spell of severe
jaundice and had been admitted to Guy’s Hospital for an operation to
discover the cause. After the operation his condition became critical,
and it became apparent that he was dying. Frances Partridge, a close
friend of the Ramseys, has described how, the evening before Frank
Ramsey’s death, she visited his ward and was surprised to find
Wittgenstein sitting in a small room that opened off the ward a few feet
from Frank’s bed:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s kindness, and also his personal grief, were somehow
apparent beneath a light, almost jocose tone which I myself found
off-putting.18 Frank had had another operation from which he had not yet
come round properly, and Lettice had had no supper, so the three of us
set off to search for some, and eventually found sausage rolls and
sherry in the station buffet. Then Wittgenstein went off and Lettice and
I returned to our furnace.</p>
<p>Ramsey died at three o’clock the following morning, on 19 January. He
was twenty-six years old.</p>
<p>The following day Wittgenstein gave his first lecture. He had been
invited to give a course of lectures at the end of the previous term by
Richard Braithwaite, on behalf of the Moral Science Faculty. Braithwaite
asked him under what title the course should be announced. After a long
silence Wittgenstein replied: ’The subject of the lectures would be
philosophy. What else can be the title of the lectures but
Philosophy.’19 And, under this uniquely general title, they were so
listed for the rest of Wittgenstein’s lecturing career.</p>
<p>During the Lent term of 1930 he gave an hour’s lecture in the Arts
School lecture room each week, followed later in the week by a two-hour
discussion held in a room in Clare College lent by R. E. Priestley
(later Sir Raymond Priestley), the explorer. Subsequently he abandoned
the formality of the lecture room altogether and held both lecture and
discussion in Priestley’s rooms, until 1931, when he acquired a set of
rooms of his own in Trinity.</p>
<p>His lecture style has often been described, and seems to have been
quite different from that of any other university lecturer: he lectured
without notes, and often appeared to be simply standing in front of his
audience, thinking aloud. Occasionally he would stop, saying, ‘Just a
minute, let me think!’ and sit down for a few minutes, staring at his
upturned hand. Sometimes the lecture would restart in response to a
question from a particularly brave member of the class. Often he would
curse his own stupidity, saying: ‘What a damn fool I am!’ or exclaim
vehemently: ‘This is as difficult as hell!’ Attending the lectures were
about fifteen people, mostly undergraduates but including also a few
dons, most notably G. E. Moore, who sat in the only armchair available
(the others sat on deckchairs) smoking his pipe and taking copious
notes. Wittgenstein’s impassioned and syncopated performances left a
memorable impression on all who heard him, and are vividly described by
I. A. Richards (the co-author, with C. K. Ogden, of The Meaning of
Meaning) in his poem, ‘The Strayed Poet’:</p>
<p>Your voice and his I heard in those Non-Lectures20</p>
<p>– Hammock chairs sprawled skew-wise all about;</p>
<p>Moore in the armchair bent on writing it all out –</p>
<p>Each soul agog for any word of yours.</p>
<p>Few could long withstand your haggard beauty,</p>
<p>Disdainful lips, wide eyes bright-lit with scorn,</p>
<p>Furrowed brow, square smile, sorrow-born</p>
<p>World-abandoning devotion to your duty.</p>
<p>Such the torment felt, the spell-bound listeners</p>
<p>Watched and waited for the words to come,</p>
<p>Held and bit their breath while you were dumb,</p>
<p>Anguished, helpless, for the hidden prisoners.</p>
<p>Poke the fire again! Open the window!</p>
<p>Shut it! – patient pacing unavailing,</p>
<p>Barren the revelations on the ceiling –</p>
<p>Dash back again to agitate a cinder.</p>
<p>‘O it’s so clear! It’s absolutely clear!’</p>
<p>Tense nerves crisp tenser then throughout the school;</p>
<p>Pencils are poised: ’Oh, I’m a bloody fool!</p>
<p>A damn’d fool!’ – So: however it appear.</p>
<p>Not that the Master isn’t pedagogic:</p>
<p>Thought-free brows grow pearly as they gaze</p>
<p>Hearts bleed with him. But – should you want a blaze,</p>
<p>Try prompting! Who is the next will drop a brick?</p>
<p>Window re-opened, fire attack’t again,</p>
<p>(Leave, but leave what’s out, long since, alone!)</p>
<p>Great calm; A sentence started; then the groan</p>
<p>Arrests the pencil leads. Round back to the refrain.</p>
<p>Richards’s title is apt; Wittgenstein’s lecturing style, and indeed
his writing style, was curiously at odds with his subject-matter, as
though a poet had somehow strayed into the analysis of the foundations
of mathematics and the Theory of Meaning. He himself once wrote: ’I
think I summed up my attitude to philosophy when I said: philosophy
ought really to be written as a poetic composition.’21</p>
<p>In these lectures Wittgenstein outlined his conception of philosophy
as ‘the attempt to be rid of a particular kind of puzzlement’,
i.e. ‘puzzles of language’.22 The method it employs is that of spelling
out the features of the grammar of our language: grammar tells us what
makes sense and what does not – it ‘lets us do some things with language
and not others; it fixes the degree of freedom’. The colour octahedron
is an example of grammar, in this sense, because it tells us that,
though we can speak of a greenish blue, we cannot speak of a greenish
red. It therefore concerns, not truth, but possibility. Geometry is also
in this sense a part of grammar. ‘Grammar is a mirror of reality.’</p>
<p>In explaining his view of the ‘internal relations’ established by
grammar, Wittgenstein explicitly contrasts it with the causal view of
meaning adopted by Ogden and Richards in The Meaning of Meaning and by
Russell in The Analysis of Mind. A causal relation is external. In
Russell’s view, for example, words are used with the intention of
causing certain sensations and/or images, and a word is used correctly
‘when the average hearer will be affected by it in the way intended’.23
To Wittgenstein, this talk of cause and effect misses the point. In his
notes he ridiculed Russell’s account by the following analogy: ’If I
wanted to eat an apple, and someone punched me in the stomach, taking
away my appetite, then it was this punch that I originally
wanted.’24</p>
<p>At the end of term the question again arose of how to provide
Wittgenstein with funds necessary for him to pursue his work. The grant
made by Trinity the previous summer was all but spent, and the college
council apparently had doubts as to whether it was worthwhile renewing
it. On 9 March, therefore, Moore wrote to Russell at his school in
Petersfield to ask him if he would be prepared to look at the work which
Wittgenstein was doing, and report to the college on its value:</p>
<p>… for there seems to be no other way of ensuring him sufficient
income to continue his work, unless the Council do make him a grant; and
I am afraid there is very little chance that they will do so, unless
they can get favourable reports from experts in the subject; and you
are, of course, by far the most competent person to make one.25</p>
<p>As Moore had anticipated, Russell was not very enthusiastic. ‘I do
not see how I can refuse’, he replied:26</p>
<p>At the same time, since it involves arguing with him, you are right
that it will require a great deal of work. I do not know anything more
fatiguing than disagreeing with him in an argument.</p>
<p>The following weekend Wittgenstein visited Russell at Beacon Hill
School and tried to explain the work that he had been doing. ‘Of course
we couldn’t get very far in two days’, he wrote to Moore, ‘but he seemed
to understand a little bit of it.’27 He arranged to see Russell again
after the Easter vacation, in order to give him a synopsis of the work
that he had done since returning to Cambridge. Thus Wittgenstein’s
Easter vacation in Vienna was taken up with the task of dictating
selected remarks from his manuscripts to a typist. ‘It is a terrible bit
of work and I feel wretched doing it’, he complained to Moore.</p>
<p>The result of this work was the typescript that has now been
published as Philosophical Remarks. It is usually referred to as a
‘transitional’ work – transitional, that is, between the Tractatus and
Philosophical Investigations – and it is perhaps the only work that can
be so-called without confusion. It does indeed represent a very
transitory phase in Wittgenstein’s philosophical development, a phase in
which he sought to replace the Theory of Meaning in the Tractatus with
the pseudo-Kantian project of ‘phenomenological analysis’ outlined in
his discussions with Schlick and Waismann. This project, as we shall
see, was soon abandoned – and with it the insistence on the Verification
Principle as the criterion for meaningfulness. As it stands,
Philosophical Remarks is the most verificationist, and at the same time
the most phenomenological, of all his writings. It uses the tools
adopted by the Vienna Circle for a task diametrically opposed to their
own.</p>
<p>Upon his return from Vienna towards the end of April, Wittgenstein
visited Russell at his home in Cornwall to show him the manuscript. From
Russell’s point of view it was not a convenient time. His wife Dora was
seven months pregnant with the child of another man (Griffen Barry, the
American journalist); his daughter Kate was ill with chickenpox; and his
son John had gone down with measles. His marriage was falling apart amid
mutual infidelities, and he was working desperately hard, writing the
popular journalism, the lectures and potboiling books that paid for his
financially draining experiment in educational reform. The pressures on
him at this time were such that colleagues at Beacon Hill School
seriously considered that he was going insane.</p>
<p>In these troubled circumstances Wittgenstein stayed for a day and a
half, after which the beleaguered Russell made a rather tired attempt to
summarize Wittgenstein’s work in a letter to Moore:</p>
<p>Unfortunately I have been ill and have therefore been unable to get
on with it as fast as I hoped.28 I think, however, that in the course of
conversation with him I got a fairly good idea of what he is at. He uses
the words ‘space’ and ‘grammar’ in peculiar senses, which are more or
less connected with each other. He holds that if it is significant to
say ‘This is red’, it cannot be significant to say ‘This is loud’. There
is one ‘space’ of colours and another ‘space’ of sounds. These ‘spaces’
are apparently given a priori in the Kantian sense, or at least not
perhaps exactly that, but something not so very different. Mistakes of
grammar result from confusing ‘spaces’. Then he has a lot of stuff about
infinity, which is always in danger of becoming what Brouwer has said,
and has to be pulled up short whenever this danger becomes apparent. His
theories are certainly important and certainly very original. Whether
they are true, I do not know: I devoutly hope not, as they make
mathematics and logic almost incredibly difficult.</p>
<p>‘Would you mind telling me whether this letter could possibly suffice
for the Council?’ he pleaded with Moore. ‘The reason I ask is that I
have at the moment so much to do that the effort involved in reading
Wittgenstein’s stuff thoroughly is almost more than I can face. I will,
however, push on with it if you think it is really necessary.’ Moore did
not consider it necessary, although, unfortunately for Russell, he did
not think the letter would suffice as a report to the Council. Russell
accordingly rewrote his letter in, as he put it, ‘grander language,
which the Council will be able to understand’, and this was then
accepted as a report on Wittgenstein’s work, and Wittgenstein was duly
awarded a grant for £100. ‘I find I can only understand Wittgenstein
when I am in good health’, Russell explained to Moore, ’which I am not
at the present moment.’29</p>
<p>Given the litany of Russell’s troubles at this time, it is surprising
that he coped as well as he did with the rigours of examining
Wittgenstein’s work. For his part, Wittgenstein was a harsh critic of
Russell’s predicament. He loathed Russell’s popular works: The Conquest
of Happiness was a ‘vomative’; What I Believe was ‘absolutely not a
“harmless thing”’. And when, during a discussion at Cambridge, someone
was inclined to defend Russell’s views on marriage, sex and ‘free love’
(expressed in Marriage and Morals), Wittgenstein replied:</p>
<p>If a person tells me he has been to the worst places I have no right
to judge him, but if he tells me it was his superior wisdom that enabled
him to go there, then I know he is a fraud.30</p>
<p>On his arrival back in Cambridge on 25 April, Wittgenstein had
reported in his diary the state of progress in his own, more restrained,
love life:</p>
<p>Arrived back in Cambridge after the Easter vacation. In Vienna often
with Marguerite. Easter Sunday with her in Neuwaldegg.31 For three hours
we kissed each other a great deal and it was very nice.</p>
<p>After the Easter term Wittgenstein returned to Vienna to spend the
summer with his family and Marguerite. He lived on the family estate,
the Hochreit, but not in the large house, preferring the woodman’s
cottage, where he had the peace, quiet and unencumbered surroundings
that he needed for his work. He received the £50 grant from Trinity
College designed to see him through the summer, but, as he wrote to
Moore: ’My life is now very economical, in fact as long as I’m here
there is no possibility of spending any money.’32 One of the few breaks
he allowed himself from this work was to write nonsense to Gilbert
Pattisson:</p>
<p>Dear Gil (old beast),33</p>
<p>You have a goal of ambition; of course you have; otherwise you’d be a
mere drifter, with the spirit of a mouse rather than of man. You are not
content to stay where you are. You want something more out of life. You
deserve a better position andandandand larger earnings for the benefit
of yourself andandandand those who are (or will be) dependent on
you.</p>
<p>How, you may ask, can I lift myself out of the ranks of the ill
paid?? To think about these and other problems I have retired to the
above address which is a country place about 3 hours journey from
Vienna. I have purchased a new big writing book of which I enclose the
label andandandand am doing a good deal of work. I also enclose my photo
which has been taken recently. The top of my head has been removed as I
don’t want it for philosophising. I have found pelmanism the most useful
method for the organisation of thought. The little gray books have made
it possible to ‘card-index’ my mind.</p>
<p>Early in the summer Wittgenstein met with Schlick and Waismann at
Schlick’s house in Vienna, primarily to prepare a lecture that Waismann
would deliver at the coming conference on the Theory of Knowledge in the
exact sciences to be held in Königsberg in September. Waismann’s
lecture, ‘The Nature of Mathematics: Wittgenstein’s Standpoint’, would
be the fourth in a series covering the main schools of thought on the
subject of the foundations of mathematics (the others in the series
were: Carnap on logicism, Heyting on intuitionism and von Neumann on
formalism). The central point of this lecture was the application of the
Verification Principle to mathematics to form the basic rule: ‘The
meaning of a mathematical concept is the mode of its use and the sense
of a mathematical proposition is the method of its verification.’ In the
event, Waismann’s lecture, and all other contributions to the
conference, were overshadowed by the announcement there of Gödel’s
famous Incompleteness Proof.fn2</p>
<p>During the summer, Wittgenstein also dictated to Waismann a list of
‘Theses’, presumably as a preliminary to the proposed joint book. These
theses are for the most part a restatement of the doctrines of the
Tractatus, but they include also a number of ‘elucidations’ on the
subject of verification. Here the Verification Principle is stated in
its most general and direct form: ‘The sense of a proposition is the way
it is verified’, and is elucidated in the following way:</p>
<p>A proposition cannot say more than is established by means of the
method of its verification. If I say ‘My friend is angry’ and establish
this in virtue of his displaying a certain perceptible behaviour, I only
mean that he displays that behaviour.34 And if I mean more by it, I
cannot specify what that extra consists in. A proposition says only what
it does say and nothing that goes beyond that.</p>
<p>Almost as soon as these theses were written, Wittgenstein became
dissatisfied with their formulation, which he came to regard as sharing
the mistaken dogmatism of the Tractatus. Indeed, Wittgenstein was
developing a conception of philosophy without any theses at all. This,
in fact, is implied by the remarks about philosophy in the Tractatus,
especially proposition 6.53:</p>
<p>The correct method in philosophy would really be the following: to
say nothing except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural
science – i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy – and
then, whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical, to
demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain signs
in his propositions. Although it would not be satisfying to the other
person – he would not have the feeling that we were teaching him
philosophy – this method would be the only strictly correct one.</p>
<p>However, the Tractatus itself, with its numbered propositions,
notoriously fails to adhere to this method. Insisting that these
propositions are not really propositions at all, but
‘pseudo-propositions’ or ‘elucidations’, is an obviously unsatisfactory
evasion of this central difficulty. And, clearly, a similar difficulty
would attend the Theses being compiled by Waismann. Philosophical
clarity must be elucidated in some other way than by the assertion of
doctrines. In 1930, at the very time that Waismann was preparing his
presentation of Wittgenstein’s ‘Theses’, Wittgenstein wrote: ’If one
tried to advance theses in philosophy, it would never be possible to
debate them, because everyone would agree to them.’35</p>
<p>Instead of teaching doctrines and developing theories, Wittgenstein
came to think, a philosopher should demonstrate a technique, a method of
achieving clarity. The crystallization of this realization and its
implications brought him to, as he put it to Drury, ‘a real resting
place’. ‘I know that my method is right’, he told Drury.36 ‘My father
was a business man, and I am a business man: I want my philosophy to be
businesslike, to get something done, to get something settled.’ The
‘transitional phase’ in Wittgenstein’s philosophy comes to an end with
this.</p>
<p>fn1 At least, it was never published in either Waismann’s or
Wittgenstein’s lifetime. in 1965 it appeared in English as The
Principles of Linguistic Philosophy, but by then the posthumous
publication of Wittgenstein’s own work had it more or less obsolete.</p>
<p>fn2 Gödel’s first and second Incompleteness Theorems state: (1) that
within any consistent formal system, there will be a sentence that can
neither be proved true nor proved false; and (2) that the consistency of
a formal system of arithmetic cannot be proved within that system. The
first (often known simply as Gödel’s Theorem) is widely believed to show
that Russell’s ambition in Principia Mathematica, of deriving all
mathematics form within a single system of logic is, in principle,
unrealizable. Whether Wittgenstein accepted his interpretation of
Gödel’s result is moot point. His comments on Gödel’s proof (see Remarks
on the Foundations of Mathematics, Appendix to Part I) appear at first
sight, to one trained in mathematical logic, quite amazingly primitive.
The best, and most sympathetic, discussion of these remarks that I know
of is S. G. Shanker’s ‘Wittgenstein’s Remarks on the Significance of
Gödel’s Theorem’, in Gödel’s Theorem in Focus, ed. S. G. Shanker(Croom
Helm, 1988), pp. 155–256.</p>
