<h4 id="the-unprintable-truth">8 THE UNPRINTABLE TRUTH</h4>
<p>LIKE MANY WAR veterans before and since, Wittgenstein found it almost
insuperably difficult to adjust to peace-time conditions. He had been a
soldier for five years, and the experience had left an indelible stamp
upon his personality. He continued to wear his uniform for many years
after the war, as though it had become a part of his identity, an
essential part, without which he would be lost. It was also perhaps a
symbol of his feeling – which persisted for the rest of his life – that
he belonged to a past age. For it was the uniform of a force that no
longer existed. Austria-Hungary was no more, and the country he returned
to in the summer of 1919 was itself undergoing a painful process of
adjustment. Vienna, once the imperial centre of a dynasty controlling
the lives of fifty million subjects of mixed race, was now the capital
of a small, impoverished and insignificant Alpine republic of little
more than six million, mostly German, inhabitants.</p>
<p>The parts of the empire in which Wittgenstein himself had fought to
defend what had been his homeland were now absorbed into foreign states.
Lemberg and Kraków were now in the new state of Poland; the area around
the Trentino mountains had been claimed by Italy; and Olmütz, that last
outpost of Austro-Hungarian culture, was now in Czechoslovakia – itself
a hybrid creation of ‘self-determination’ – of which Paul Engelmann had
become a reluctant citizen. (The problems encountered by Engelmann in
obtaining a Czechoslovakian passport kept him from visiting Wittgenstein
in Vienna for many months.) To many Austrians, the whole raison d’être
of their separate identity had been destroyed, and in 1919 the majority
voted for Anschluss with Germany. If they were to be nothing more than a
German state, it was felt, then surely they had better be part of the
fatherland. That option was denied them by the Allies, who also, through
the war reparations demanded by the Treaties of Versailles and St
Germain, ensured that the German people of both German states would
remain poor, resentful and revengeful throughout the inter-war
period.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had entered the war hoping it would change him, and this
it had. He had undergone four years of active service and a year of
incarceration; he had faced death, experienced a religious awakening,
taken responsibility for the lives of others, and endured long periods
of close confinement in the company of the sort of people he would not
previously have shared a railway carriage with. All this had made him a
different person – had given him a new identity. In a sense, he was not
returning to anything in 1919: everything had changed, and he could no
more slip back into the life he had left in 1914 than he could revert to
being the ‘little Wittgenstein’ that the Jolles had known in Berlin. He
was faced with the task of re-creating himself – of finding a new role
for the person that had been forged by the experiences of the last five
years.</p>
<p>His family were dismayed by the changes they saw in him. They could
not understand why he wanted to train to become a teacher in elementary
schools. Hadn’t Bertrand Russell himself acknowledged his philosophic
genius, and stated that the next big step in philosophy would come from
him? Why did he now want to waste that genius on the uneducated poor? It
was, his sister Hermine remarked, like somebody wanting to use a
precision instrument to open crates. To this, Wittgenstein replied:</p>
<p>You remind me of somebody who is looking out through a closed window
and cannot explain to himself the strange movements of a passer-by.1 He
cannot tell what sort of storm is raging out there or that this person
might only be managing with difficulty to stay on his feet.</p>
<p>Of course, it might be thought that the most natural step for the
person in Wittgenstein’s analogy to take would be to come in out of the
storm. But this Wittgenstein could not do. The hardship suffered during
the war was not experienced by him as something from which he sought
refuge, but as the very thing that gave his life meaning. To shelter
from the storm in the comfort and security which his family’s wealth and
his own education could provide would be to sacrifice everything he had
gained from struggling with adversity. It would be to give up climbing
mountains in order to live on a plateau.</p>
<p>It was essential to Wittgenstein, not only that he should not use the
privileges of his inherited wealth, but that he could not do so. On his
arrival home from the war he was one of the wealthiest men in Europe,
owing to his father’s financial astuteness in transferring the family’s
wealth, before the war, into American bonds. But within a month of
returning, he had disposed of his entire estate. To the concern of his
family, and the astonishment of the family accountant, he insisted that
his entire inheritance should be made over to his sisters, Helene and
Hermine, and his brother Paul (Gretl, it was decided, was already too
wealthy to be included). Other members of the family, among them his
Uncle Paul Wittgenstein, could not understand how they could have
accepted the money. Couldn’t they at least have secretly put some of it
aside in case he should later come to regret his decision? These people,
writes Hermine, could not know that it was precisely that possibility
that troubled him:</p>
<p>A hundred times he wanted to assure himself that there was no
possibility of any money still belonging to him in any shape or form.2
To the despair of the notary carrying out the transfer, he returned to
this point again and again.</p>
<p>Eventually the notary was persuaded to execute Wittgenstein’s wishes
to the letter. ‘So’, he sighed, ’you want to commit financial
suicide!’3</p>
<p>In September 1919, after ridding himself of his wealth and having
enrolled at the Lehrerbildungsanhalt in the Kundmanngasse, Wittgenstein
took another step towards independence from his privileged background,
moving out of the family home in the Neuwaldeggergasse and taking
lodgings in Untere Viaduktgasse, a street in Vienna’s Third District
within easy walking distance of the college.fn1</p>
<p>This period was one of great suffering for Wittgenstein, and on more
than one occasion during these months he contemplated taking his own
life. He was exhausted and disorientated. ‘I’m not quite normal yet’,4
he wrote to Russell soon after his return; and to Engelmann: ‘I am not
very well (i. e. as far as my state of mind is concerned).’5 He asked
both Russell and Engelmann to come and see him as soon as they could,
but neither could manage the trip. Engelmann was having problems
obtaining a Czechoslovakian passport, and Russell was engaged on a
course of lectures at the London School of Economics (the material of
which formed the basis for The Analysis of Mind), which would keep him
in England until the Christmas vacation. Besides, there was a real
possibility that Russell would not be given permission to leave the
country – ‘for as you may know’, he wrote to Wittgenstein, ‘I have
fallen out with the Government’.6 He nevertheless suggested that they
try to meet at The Hague at Christmas: ‘I could manage a week, if the
government will let me go.’</p>
<p>The frustration of not being able to reunite with either Engelmann or
Russell undoubtedly added to the emotional strain Wittgenstein was
suffering. He had the feeling of losing all his old friends and being
unable to make any new ones. The meeting he had most looked forward to
during the last five years had been denied him by the death of ‘dear
David’ (so he wrote to Mrs Pinsent), and other eagerly anticipated
meetings were either frustrated or turned out to be a bitter
disappointment. He looked up Adolf Loos, but was, he told Engelmann,
‘horrified and nauseated’:7</p>
<p>He has become infected with the most virulent bogus intellectualism!
He gave me a pamphlet about a proposed ‘fine arts office’, in which he
speaks about a sin against the Holy Ghost. This surely is the limit! I
was already a bit depressed when I went to see Loos, but that was the
last straw!</p>
<p>Nor was he – a thirty-year-old war veteran – likely to make many
friends among the teenagers with whom he attended lectures at the
teacher training college. ‘I can no longer behave like a grammar-school
boy’, he wrote to Engelmann, ‘and – funny as it sounds – the humiliation
is so great for me that often I think I can hardly bear it!’ He
complained in similar spirit to Russell:8</p>
<p>The benches are full of boys of 17 and 18 and I’ve reached 30.9 That
leads to some very funny situations – and many very unpleasant ones too.
I often feel miserable!</p>
<p>Though he was embarking on a new career and a new life, and in many
ways was deliberately severing the ties that bound him to his family
background, he needed to establish some continuity between the person he
was before the war and the person he had become. Before he started his
course at the Lehrerbildungsanhalt, he spent about ten days living at
the Hochreit, in order, as he put it to Engelmann, ‘to find something of
myself again if I can’.10</p>
<p>His family connections, and the ambivalence with which he regarded
them, provoked one of the unpleasant situations at college he mentions
to Russell. His teacher asked him whether he was related to the
Wittgensteins, the rich Wittgensteins. He replied that he was. Was he
closely related? the teacher persisted. To this, Wittgenstein felt
compelled to lie: ’Not very.’11</p>
<p>The defeat and impoverishment of his home country, the death of his
most beloved friend, the frustration at not being able to re-establish
old friendships and the strain of putting his whole life on a new
footing might themselves be sufficient to account for Wittgenstein’s
suicidal state during the autumn of 1919. But perhaps the most important
cause of his depression was his failure to find a publisher for the
Tractatus – or even a single person who understood it.</p>
<p>He had, he thought, completed a book that provided a definitive and
unassailably true solution to the problems of philosophy. How, then,
could he have anticipated such difficulty in finding someone willing to
publish it? Even after it had been rejected by Jahoda, Wittgenstein
could write confidently from the prison camp at Cassino: ’My book will
be published as soon as I get home.’12</p>
<p>Within a few days of his return, he took the book to the Viennese
offices of Wilhelm Braumüller, the publishers of Otto Weininger’s Sex
and Character. Braumüller, he told Russell, ‘naturally neither knows my
name nor understands anything about philosophy [and] requires the
judgment of some expert in order to be sure that the book is really
worth printing’:13</p>
<p>For this purpose he wanted to apply to one of the people he relies on
here (probably a professor of philosophy). So I told him that no one
here would be able to form a judgment on the book, but that you would
perhaps be kind enough to write him a brief assessment of the value of
the work, and if this happened to be favourable that would be enough to
induce him to publish it. The publisher’s address is: Wilhelm
Braumüller, XI Servitengasse 5, Vienna. Now please write him a few words
– as much as your conscience will allow you to.</p>
<p>After receiving Russell’s testimonial, Braumüller offered to publish
the book on condition that Wittgenstein himself paid for the printing
and paper. By the time the offer was made he had no money to pay such
costs, but even if he had he would still have refused. ‘I consider it
indecent’, he said, ‘to force a work upon the world – to which the
publisher belongs – in this way.14 The writing was my affair; but the
world must accept it in the normal manner.’</p>
<p>While waiting for Braumüller’s decision, he received a letter from
Frege – a late reply to Wittgenstein’s last letter from Cassino, and to
a further letter which Wittgenstein had written since his return to
Vienna. Frege was still far from satisfied with the clarity of
Wittgenstein’s use of the word Sachverhalt:</p>
<p>You now write: ‘What corresponds to an elementary proposition, if it
is true, is the existence of a Sachverhalt.’15 Here you do not explain
the expression ‘Sachverhalt’, but the whole expression ‘the existence of
a Sachverhalt’.</p>
<p>He was further perturbed by what Wittgenstein had written about the
purpose of the book. ‘This book will perhaps only be understood by those
who have themselves already thought the thoughts which are expressed in
it’, Wittgenstein had written in the preface (he must also have written
something similar to Frege). ‘It is therefore not a textbook. Its object
would be attained if it afforded pleasure to one who read it with
understanding.’ This Frege found strange:</p>
<p>The pleasure of reading your book can therefore no longer be aroused
by the content which is already known, but only by the peculiar form
given to it by the author. The book thereby becomes an artistic rather
than a scientific achievement; what is said in it takes second place to
the way in which it is said.</p>
<p>He was encouraged, however, by one sentence in Wittgenstein’s letter.
Responding to Frege’s remarks about the identical meanings of his
propositions, ‘The world is everything that is the case’, and ‘The world
is the totality of facts’, Wittgenstein wrote: ‘The sense of both
propositions is one and the same, but not the ideas that I associated
with them when I wrote them.’16 Here Frege was (or thought he was) on
home ground, and agreed wholeheartedly with Wittgenstein’s point, the
more so because it touched on a thought that was dear to him at this
time. In order to make Wittgenstein’s point, he argued, it was necessary
to distinguish a proposition from its sense, thus opening up the
possibility that two propositions could have the same sense and yet
differ in the ideas associated with them. ‘The actual sense of a
proposition’, he wrote to Wittgenstein, ’is the same for everybody; but
the ideas which a person associates with the proposition belong to him
alone … No one can have another’s ideas.’17</p>
<p>It was a theme Frege had dealt with in an article he had recently
published, a copy of which he enclosed with his letter to Wittgenstein.
The article was called ‘Der Gedanke’ (‘The Thought’), and was published
in the journal Beiträgen zur Philosophie des Deutschen Idealismus.
Though exasperated by Frege’s laboured attempts to clarify the meaning
of his book (‘He doesn’t understand a single word of my work’, he wrote
to Russell after receiving Frege’s letter, ‘and I’m thoroughly exhausted
from giving what are purely and simply explanations’), Wittgenstein
seized the opportunity to offer his work to another potentially
sympathetic publisher.18 After rejecting Braumüller’s offer to publish
it if he would pay for the printing, he asked Frege to investigate the
possibility of having it published in the same journal that had
published Frege’s article.</p>
<p>Frege’s reply was not greatly encouraging. He could, he told
Wittgenstein, write to the editor of the journal and tell him: ‘that I
have learnt to know you as a thinker to be taken thoroughly
seriously’.19 But: ‘Of the treatise itself I can offer no judgement, not
because I am not in agreement with its contents, but rather because the
content is too unclear to me.’ He could ask the editor if he wished to
see Wittgenstein’s book, but: ‘I hardly think that this would lead to
anything.’ The book would take up about fifty printed pages, nearly the
whole journal, and: ‘There seems to me not a chance that the editor
would give up a whole edition to a single, still unknown writer.’</p>
<p>If, however, Wittgenstein were prepared to split the book into
sections, its publication in a periodical would be more feasible (and,
one gathers, would receive more support from Frege himself):</p>
<p>You write in your preface that the truth of the thoughts communicated
seems to you unassailable and definitive. Now could not one of these
thoughts, in which the solution to a philosophical problem is contained,
itself provide the subject for an article and thus the whole book be
divided into as many parts as the number of philosophical problems with
which it deals?</p>
<p>This would have the merit, argued Frege, of not frightening the
reader away from the book because of its length. And furthermore: ‘If
the first article, which would have to lay the foundations, met with
approval, it would be easier to find a place in the periodical for the
rest of the treatise.’</p>
<p>It would also, he thought, help to make Wittgenstein’s work clearer.
After reading the preface, he told Wittgenstein, one did not really know
what to make of the first proposition. One expected to see a question,
to have a problem outlined, to which the book would address itself.
Instead, one came across a bald assertion, without being given the
grounds for it. Wouldn’t it be better to make clear to which problems
the book was supposed to provide a definitive solution?</p>
<p>‘Don’t take these remarks badly’, Frege ended; ‘they are made with
good intentions.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein would have nothing to do with Frege’s suggestion. To
divide the book up in the manner recommended would be, in his opinion,
to ‘mutilate it from beginning to end and, in a word, make another work
out of it’.20 As Frege had remarked earlier, the form in which
Wittgenstein’s thoughts were expressed was essential to the nature of
the work. After receiving Frege’s letter he abandoned the attempt to
have it published in Beiträgen zur Philosophie des Deutschen
Idealismus.</p>
<p>Reasoning, perhaps, that if the book was too literary for a
philosophical journal he would try a literary journal instead,
Wittgenstein next thought of von Ficker and Der Brenner. By coincidence,
the day on which he was about to go to see Loos to get Ficker’s address,
a letter from Ficker arrived telling him that Der Brenner would indeed
continue to be published and asking him if he would like to be sent a
copy. Immediately, Wittgenstein wrote a long letter to Ficker,
explaining the history of his book. ‘About a year ago’, he wrote, ‘I
finished a philosophical work on which I had worked for the previous
seven years’:21</p>
<p>It is quite strictly speaking the presentation of a system. And this
presentation is extremely compressed since I have only retained in it
that which really occurred to me – and how it occurred to me.</p>
<p>Immediately after finishing the work, he continued, he wanted to find
a publisher: ‘And therein lies a great difficulty’:</p>
<p>The work is very small, only about sixty pages long. Who writes
sixty-page brochures about philosophical matters? … [only] those
certain, totally hopeless hacks who have neither the mind of the great,
nor the erudition of the professors, and yet would like to have
something printed at any price. Therefore such products are usually
printed privately. But I simply cannot mix my life’s work – for that is
what it is – among these writings.</p>
<p>He then told Ficker of the unsatisfactory responses he had so far had
from the publishers of, respectively, Kraus, Weininger and Frege.
Finally, he got to the point: ‘it occurred to me whether you might be
inclined to take the poor thing into your protection’. If Ficker thought
its publication in Der Brenner conceivable, Wittgenstein would send him
the manuscript. ‘Until then I should only like to say this about
it’:</p>
<p>The work is strictly philosophical and at the same time literary, but
there is no babbling in it.</p>
<p>Ficker replied with a mixture of encouragement and caution. ‘Why
hadn’t you thought of me immediately?’ he asked.22 ‘For you could well
imagine that I would take a completely different, i.e. a deeper,
interest in your work than a publisher who had only his commercial
interests in mind.’ Strangely, his letter then dwelt at length on the
need for him to keep his commercial interests in mind. He had, he said,
previously published Der Brenner for love, not money. But this could not
continue; times were hard, he had a wife and children to support, and
printing costs were prohibitively high. In the difficult financial
climate that prevailed in Austria after the war, publishing was a risky
business, and he had to ensure that he did not take more chances than
were necessary. Nevertheless, with the proviso that ‘strictly scientific
works are not really our field’ (and with the awareness that he was
still somewhat in Wittgenstein’s debt for the benefactions of 1914),he
asked to see Wittgenstein’s manuscript: ‘Rest assured, dear Mr
Wittgenstein, that I will do my best to meet your wishes.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was sufficiently encouraged by this to send Ficker the
manuscript. ‘I am pinning my hopes on you’, he wrote in the accompanying
letter, which also provides one of the most direct statements we have of
how he wished his book to be understood.23 He needed to say something
about it, he told Ficker: ‘For you won’t – I really believe – get too
much out of reading it. Because you won’t understand it; the content
will be strange to you’:</p>
<p>In reality, it isn’t strange to you, for the point of the book is
ethical. I once wanted to give a few words in the foreword which now
actually are not in it, which, however, I’ll write to you now because
they might be a key for you: I wanted to write that my work consists of
two parts: of the one which is here, and of everything which I have not
written. And precisely this second part is the important one. For the
Ethical is delimited from within, as it were, by my book; and I’m
convinced that, strictly speaking, it can ONLY be delimited in this way.
In brief, I think: All of that which many are babbling today, I have
defined in my book by remaining silent about it. Therefore the book
will, unless I’m quite wrong, have much to say which you want to say
yourself, but perhaps you won’t notice that it is said in it. For the
time being, I’d recommend that you read the foreword and the conclusion
since these express the point most directly.</p>
<p>If this was intended to convince Ficker that the message of the
Tractatus was, despite appearances, consonant with the aims of Der
Brenner, it was misjudged. Wittgenstein was asking Ficker to accept that
what he wanted to say about ethics had best be said by remaining silent
– and, by implication, that much of what Ficker published in Der Brenner
was mere ‘babbling’. His letter was hardly calculated, either, to
reassure Ficker’s financial worries. A book in which the most important
part has been left out could not be expected to be a very attractive
proposition to a publisher with a concerned eye to his own solvency.</p>
<p>Ficker’s response was cool. He could not give a definite answer, he
wrote on 18 November, but there was a possibility that he would not be
able to publish Wittgenstein’s work. It was, at that moment, in the
hands of his friend and colleague, who, as he had explained in the
previous letter, was responsible for the financial affairs of the
publishing house. The opinion of this colleague was that the work was
too specialized to appear in Der Brenner – although that was not
necessarily his last word on the subject. Nevertheless, Ficker had
approached Rilke for advice on where an alternative publisher might be
found. Finally, could he show the book to a philosophy professor? He
knew someone at Innsbruck University who was familiar with the work of
Russell and who was interested to read what Wittgenstein had written.
Who knows, he might even be able to help find a publisher for it.</p>
<p>The letter threw Wittgenstein into a state of despondency. ‘Do you
remember’, he wrote to Russell, ‘how you were always pressing me to
publish something? And now when I should like to, it can’t be managed.24
The devil take it!’ To Ficker he replied: ‘Your letter, naturally,
wasn’t pleasant for me, although I wasn’t really surprised by your
answer.25 I don’t know where I can get my work accepted either. If I
were only somewhere else than in this lousy world!’ Yes, Ficker could
show the book to a professor if he liked, but showing a philosophical
work to a professor of philosophy would be like casting pearls before
swine – ‘At any rate he won’t understand a word of it’:</p>
<p>And now, only one more request: Make it short and sweet with me. Tell
me ‘no’ quickly, rather then too slowly; that is Austrian delicacy which
my nerves are not strong enough to withstand, at the moment.</p>
<p>Alarmed by this note of despair, Ficker wired a telegram: ’Don’t
worry. Treatise will appear whatever the circumstances. Letter
follows.’26 Much relieved, Wittgenstein replied that he would rather
Ficker accepted the book because he considered it worth publishing than
because he wanted to do a favour. He nevertheless seemed inclined to
accept the offer: ’I think I can say that if you print Dallago, Haecker,
etc., then you can also print my book.’27 The next letter he received,
however, reinforced any doubts he may still have had. Ficker wrote that
he was still hoping something would come of Rilke’s attempt to find a
publisher.28 But if not, so moved was he by the bitterness and distress
evident in Wittgenstein’s previous letter, he had decided – even if it
meant risking everything he had – to see to the publication of
Wittgenstein’s work himself. Rather that than disappoint the trust
Wittgenstein had placed in him. (By the way, he added, if it did come to
that was it absolutely necessary to include the decimal numbers?)</p>
<p>This, obviously, would not do. ‘I couldn’t accept the
responsibility’, Wittgenstein wrote to him, ’of a person’s (whoever’s)
livelihood being placed in jeopardy by publishing my book.’29 Ficker
hadn’t betrayed his trust:</p>
<p>… for my trust, or rather, simply my hope, was only directed to your
perspicacity that the treatise is not junk – unless I am deceiving
myself – but not to the fact that you would accept it, without thinking
something of it, just out of kindness toward me and against your
interests.30</p>
<p>And, yes, the decimals were absolutely necessary: ‘because they alone
give the book lucidity and clarity and it would be an incomprehensible
jumble without them’. The book had to be published as it was, and for
the reason that it was perceived to be worth publishing. Nothing else
would do. If Rilke could somehow arrange that, he would be very pleased,
but: ‘if that isn’t possible, we can just forget about it’.</p>
<p>It is difficult to know how much trouble Rilke went to on
Wittgenstein’s behalf. In a letter from Berne, dated 12 November 1919,
he asks Ficker whether his own publisher, Insel-Verlag, might be
suitable, and further suggests Otto Reichl, the publisher of Count
Keyserling. Nothing came of either suggestion, and no further
correspondence on the subject survives.</p>
<p>By this time Wittgenstein was sick to death of the whole business.
‘Is there a Krampus who fetches evil publishers?’ he asked Ficker; and
on 16 November he wrote to Engelmann:31</p>
<p>Just how far I have gone downhill you can see from the fact that I
have on several occasions contemplated taking my own life.32 Not from my
despair about my own badness but for purely external reasons.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s despair was alleviated to some extent when, in
November, he left his lodgings in Untere Viaduktgasse and moved in with
the Sjögren family at their home in St Veitgasse, in Vienna’s Thirteenth
District. The Sjögrens were lifelong friends of the Wittgenstein family;
the father, Arvid Sjögren, had been a director of a steelworks belonging
to the Wittgenstein group, and the mother, Mima, now widowed, was a
particularly close friend of Wittgenstein’s sister Hermine. Mima was
having problems bringing up her three sons alone, and it was thought by
the Wittgenstein family that Wittgenstein, by acting as the man of the
house, might be able to help her. If he refused to enjoy the benefits of
living with his own family, perhaps he could be induced to share the
responsibilities of caring for another. This, it was thought, might have
a calming effect on him.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, it worked. Wittgenstein’s time with the Sjögrens
was, in the context of perhaps the most desperately unhappy year of his
life, comparatively pleasant. ‘Normal human beings are a balm to me’, he
wrote to Engelmann, ‘and a torment at the same time.’33 With the middle
son, Arvid, in particular, he formed a close friendship, and indeed
became a sort of father figure to him. Arvid Sjögren was a big, clumsy,
gruff boy – a ‘bear of a man’, he was later called – who continued to
look to Wittgenstein for moral guidance throughout most of his life.
Under Wittgenstein’s influence he abandoned all thought of studying at
university and trained instead as a mechanic. In this sense he was,
perhaps, Wittgenstein’s first disciple, the forerunner of the bright
young undergraduates at Cambridge of the 1930s and 1940s who similarly
chose to learn an honest trade rather than pursuing the kind of careers
for which their education and privileged backgrounds had prepared
them.</p>
<p>Throughout November Wittgenstein and Russell exchanged letters in
connection with their proposed meeting at The Hague in December; there
were dates to arrange, bureaucratic hurdles to overcome, and, in
Wittgenstein’s case at least, money to raise to finance the trip. ‘It is
terrible to think of your having to earn a living’, Russell wrote to
him, after hearing that he had given all his money away, ’but I am not
surprised by your action. I am much poorer too. They say Holland is very
expensive but I suppose we can endure a week of it without going
bankrupt.’34 To pay Wittgenstein’s expenses, Russell bought some
furniture and books that Wittgenstein had left behind in a dealer’s shop
in Cambridge before his trip to Norway. It included the furniture he had
chosen so painstakingly in the autumn of 1912. Russell paid £100; it
was, he says in his autobiography, the best bargain he ever made.</p>
<p>Russell arrived at The Hague on 10 December, accompanied by his new
lover and future wife, Dora Black. They booked into the Hotal Twee
Steden. ‘Come here as quick as you can after your arrival in The Hague’,
Russell wrote to Wittgenstein; ‘I am impatient to see you – We will find
some way to get your book published – in England if necessary.’35
Wittgenstein arrived a few days later, accompanied by Arvid Sjögren
(remembered by Dora Russell as: ‘a vague, shadowy figure who spoke
little, even at mealtimes’).36 For Russell and Wittgenstein, the week
was taken up with intense discussion of Wittgenstein’s book.
Wittgenstein was, Russell wrote to Colette on 12 December, ‘so full of
logic that I can hardly get him to talk about anything personal’.37
Wittgenstein didn’t want to waste a moment of their time together. He
would rise early and hammer at Russell’s door until he woke, and then
discuss logic without interruption for hours on end. They went through
the book line by line. The discussions were fruitful: Russell came to
think even more highly of the book than he had before, while
Wittgenstein had the euphoric feeling that, at last, somebody understood
it.</p>
<p>Not that Russell agreed with it entirely. In particular, he refused
to accept Wittgenstein’s view that any assertion about the world as a
whole was meaningless. To Russell, the proposition: ‘There are at least
three things in the world’ was both meaningful and true. During
discussion of this point Russell took a sheet of white paper and made
three blobs of ink on it: ‘I besought him to admit that, since there
were these three blobs, there must be at least three things in the
world; but he refused resolutely’:38</p>
<p>He would admit there were three blobs on the page, because that was a
finite assertion, but he would not admit that anything at all could be
said about the world as a whole.</p>
<p>‘This part of his doctrine’, Russell insisted, ‘is to my mind
definitely mistaken.’</p>
<p>Related to this was Russell’s refusal to accept what Wittgenstein had
earlier told him was the ‘main contention’ of the book: the doctrine
that what cannot be said by propositions can be shown. To Russell this
remained an unappealingly mystical notion. He was surprised, he wrote to
Ottoline, to find that Wittgenstein had become a complete mystic. ’He
has penetrated deep into mystical ways of thought and feeling, but I
think (though he wouldn’t agree) that what he likes best in mysticism is
its power to make him stop thinking.’39</p>
<p>He was nonetheless sufficiently impressed by the Theory of Logic in
the book to offer to write an introduction, based on their conversation
at The Hague, which would attempt to explain the most difficult parts of
the book. With an introduction by Russell, now a best-selling author,
the publication of the book was almost guaranteed. Wittgenstein returned
to Vienna in jubilant mood. ‘I enjoyed our time together very much’, he
wrote to Russell on 8 January 1920, ‘and I have the feeling (haven’t you
too?) that we did a great deal of real work during that week.’40 To
Ficker, he wrote: ‘The book is now a much smaller risk for a publisher,
or perhaps even none at all, since Russell’s name is very well known and
ensures a quite special group of readers for the book’:41</p>
<p>By this I naturally don’t mean that it will thus come into the right
hands; but at any rate, favourable circumstances are less excluded.</p>
<p>Ficker, who did not reply for over two weeks, was evidently still not
convinced that the book would be anything other than a financial
liability. ‘With or without Russell’, he wrote on 16 January, ’the
publication of your treatise is, under the present circumstances, a risk
that no publisher in Austria today can afford to take.’42 He advised
Wittgenstein to have the book published in English first and then – if
the opportunity arose – in German.</p>
<p>Anticipating he would have no success with Ficker, Wittgenstein had
already made appoaches to another publisher. Through Engelmann, he
obtained a recommendation from a Dr Heller to the Leipzig publishing
house, Reclam, who, after learning of Russell’s introduction, were only
too willing to consider the book.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein at once took the manuscript from Ficker and sent it to
Reclam, and throughout February and March waited impatiently for
Russell’s introduction to arrive. When it did, he was immediately
disappointed. ‘There’s so much of it that I’m not in agreement with’, he
told Russell, ‘both where you’re critical of me and also where you’re
simply trying to elucidate my point of view.’43 He nevertheless had it
translated into German, in preparation for its printing, but this only
made matters worse: ‘All the refinement of your English style’, he wrote
to Russell, ‘was, obviously, lost in the translation and what remained
was superficiality and misunderstanding.’44 He sent the introduction to
Reclam but told them it was not for publication; it was to serve only
for the publisher’s own orientation with regard to the work. As a
consequence Reclam, as Wittgenstein had anticipated, rejected the book.
He comforted himself with the following argument, which, he told
Russell, ‘seems to me unanswerable’:</p>
<p>Either my piece is a work of the highest rank, or it is not a work of
the highest rank. In the latter (and more probable) case I myself am in
favour of it not being printed. And in the former case it’s a matter of
indifference whether it’s printed twenty or a hundred years sooner or
later. After all, who asks whether the Critique of Pure Reason, for
example, was written in 17X or y.</p>
<p>Russell was at this time visiting Soviet Russia with a Labour Party
delegation, and did not see Wittgenstein’s letter until his return in
June. He reacted with remarkable generosity. ‘I don’t care twopence
about the introduction, but I shall be really sorry if your book isn’t
printed.45 May I try, in that case, to have it printed in England?’ Yes,
Wittgenstein replied, ‘you can do what you like with it’.46 He himself
had given up trying: ‘But if you feel like getting it printed, it is
entirely at your disposal.’</p>
<p>The comforting argument he had earlier offered Russell did not
prevent Wittgenstein from sinking into a deep depression after Reclam’s
rejection. At the end of May he wrote to Engelmann: ‘I have continually
thought of taking my own life, and the idea still haunts me sometimes. I
have sunk to the lowest point.47 May you never be in that position!
Shall I ever be able to raise myself up again? Well, we shall see.’</p>
<p>He was, by this time, living on his own again. At the beginning of
April he moved out of the Sjögrens’ home and into lodgings once more,
this time in Rasumofskygasse, which, like his earlier lodgings, was in
Vienna’s Third District. ‘This change of home was accompanied by
operations which I can never remember without a sinking feeling’, he
told Engelmann.48 In fact, he fled the house after it became apparent
that Mrs Sjögren was in love with him.fn2</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s letters to Russell, and especially to Engelmann,
during this period, show him to be desperately, suicidally, depressed.
The severity of self-accusation contained in them is extreme even for
Wittgenstein, who was always harsh on himself. He attributes his
miserableness to his own ‘baseness and rottenness’, and talks of being
afraid that: ‘the devil will come and take me one day’.fn3</p>
<p>For both Wittgenstein and Engelmann, religion was inseparable from an
awareness of one’s own failings. Indeed, for Engelmann, such awareness
was central to the religious outlook:</p>
<p>If I am unhappy and know that my unhappiness reflects a gross
discrepancy between myself and life as it is, I solved nothing; I shall
be on the wrong track and I shall never find a way out of the chaos of
my emotions and thoughts so long as I have not achieved the supreme and
crucial insight that that discrepancy is not the fault of life as it is,
but of myself as I am …49</p>
<p>The person who has achieved this insight and holds on to it, and who
will try again and again to live up to it, is religious.</p>
<p>On this view, to be unhappy is to find fault with oneself: one’s
misery can only be the consequence of one’s own ‘baseness and
rottenness’; to be religious is to recognize one’s own unworthiness and
to take responsibility for correcting it.</p>
<p>This was a theme that dominated the conversations and the
correspondence between Wittgenstein and Engelmann, as, for example, in
the set of remarks on religion that Engelmann sent Wittgenstein in
January:</p>
<p>Before Christ, people experienced God (or Gods) as something outside
themselves.50</p>
<p>Since Christ, people (not all, but those who have learnt to see
through him) see God as something in themselves. So that one can say
that, through Christ, God has been drawn into mankind …</p>
<p>… Through Christ God has become man.</p>
<p>Lucifer wanted to become God and was not.</p>
<p>Christ became God without wanting to.</p>
<p>So the wicked thing is to want pleasure without deserving it.</p>
<p>If, however, one does right, without wanting pleasure, so joy comes
of its own accord.</p>
<p>When Wittgenstein came to comment on these remarks, he did not
dispute the truth of them, but only the adequacy of their expression.
‘They are still not clear enough’, he wrote.51 ‘It must be possible, I
believe, to say all these things much more adequately. (Or, not at all,
which is even more likely).’ Even if their most perfect expression
should turn out to be silence, then, they are nonetheless true.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein regarded Engelmann as ‘someone who understands man’.
When, after the attempt to be published by Reclam had come to nothing,
he was feeling emotionally and spiritually demoralized, he felt an
urgent need to talk with him. And when, at the end of May, he reached
his ‘lowest point’ and continually thought of suicide, it was to
Engelmann he turned for support. He received it in the form of a long
letter about Engelmann’s own experience. Engelmann wrote that he had
recently been worried about his motives for his own work – whether they
were decent and honest motives. He had taken some time off to be alone
in the countryside, to think about it. The first few days were
unsatisfactory:</p>
<p>But then I did something about which I can tell you, because you know
me well enough not to regard it as a piece of stupidity.52 That is, I
took down a kind of ‘confession’, in which I tried to recall the series
of events in my life, in as much detail as is possible in the space of
an hour. With each event I tried to make clear to myself how I should
have behaved. By means of such a general over-view [Übersicht] the
confused picture was much simplified.</p>
<p>The next day, on the basis of this newly-gained insight, I revised my
plans and intentions for the future.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know at all’, he wrote, ‘whether something similar would be
good or necessary for you now; but perhaps my telling you this would
help you now to find something.’</p>
<p>‘Concerning what you write about thoughts of suicide,’ Engelmann
added, ‘my thoughts are as follows’:</p>
<p>Behind such thoughts, just as in others, there can probably lie
something of a noble motive. But that this motive shows itself in this
way, that it takes the form of a contemplation of suicide, is certainly
wrong. Suicide is certainly a mistake. So long as a person lives, he is
never completely lost. What drives a man to suicide is, however, the
fear that he is completely lost. This fear is, in view of what has
already been said, ungrounded. In this fear a person does the worst
thing he can do, he deprives himself of the time in which it would be
possible for him to escape being lost.</p>
<p>‘You undoubtedly know all this better than I’, wrote Engelmann,
excusing himself for appearing to have something to teach Wittgenstein,
‘but one sometimes forgets what one knows.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein himself was later to use, more than once, the technique
of preparing a confession in order to clarify his own life. On this
occasion, however, it was not the advice that did him good, but simply
reading about Engelmann’s own efforts. ‘Many thanks for your kind
letter’, he wrote on 21 June, ‘which has given me much pleasure and
thereby perhaps helped me a little, although as far as the merits of my
case are concerned I am beyond any outside help’:53</p>
<p>In fact I am in a state of mind that is terrible to me. I have been
through it several times before: it is the state of not being able to
get over a particular fact. It is a pitiable state, I know. But there is
only one remedy that I can see, and that is of course to come to terms
with that fact. But this is just like what happens when a man who can’t
swim has fallen into the water and flails about with his hands and feet
and feels that he cannot keep his head above water. That is the position
I am in now. I know that to kill oneself is always a dirty thing to do.
Surely one cannot will one’s own destruction, and anybody who has
visualized what is in practice involved in the act of suicide knows that
suicide is always a rushing of one’s own defences. But nothing is worse
than to be forced to take oneself by surprise.</p>
<p>Of course it all boils down to the fact that I have no faith!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no possible way of knowing what fact he is
here talking about. Certainly, it is some fact about himself, and
something for which he felt the only remedy to be religious faith.
Without such faith, his life was unendurable. He was in the position of
wishing himself dead, but unable to bring himself to suicide. As he put
it to Russell: ’The best for me, perhaps, would be if I could lie down
one evening and not wake up again.’54</p>
<p>‘But perhaps there is something better left for me’, he added
parenthetically. The letter was written on 7 July, the day he received
his teaching certificate: perhaps in teaching, it is implied, he would
find something worth living for.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had completed his course at the Lehrerbildungsanhalt
satisfactorily, but not without misgivings. The best thing about it, he
told Engelmann, was that on teaching practice he was able to read
fairy-tales to the children: ‘It pleases them and relieves the strain on
me.’55 It was the ‘one good thing in my life just now’.</p>
<p>He received help and encouragement from his friend from the
prisoner-of-war camp, Ludwig Hänsel, himself a teacher, and a figure
well known in Viennese educational circles. On at least one occasion he
considered giving the course up, because, he told Hänsel, of the bad
relations between himself and his fellow men. Hänsel, perceptively,
attributed this to Wittgenstein’s chronic sensitivity. ‘There is no wall
between you and your fellow men’, he wrote.56 ‘I have a thicker crust
around me.’</p>
<p>At the Lehrerbildungsanhalt Wittgenstein would have been taught in
accordance with the principles of the School Reform Movement, which was,
under the leadership of the education minister, Otto Glöckel, attempting
to reshape the education of the new, post-war, republic of Austria. It
was a movement fired with secular, republican and socialist ideals, and
it had attracted the good will, and even the participation, of a good
number of well known Austrian intellectuals. It was not, however, a
movement with which Wittgenstein himself could readily identify. It was
not the idea of fitting pupils to live in a democracy that had inspired
him to become a teacher, such social and political motives being alien
to the fundamentally religious morality that he shared with
Engelmann.</p>
<p>Hänsel, too, was a religious man, and for that very reason at odds
with the School Reform Movement. He was to become a leading light in a
Conservative-Catholic organization called Der Bund Neuland, which sought
to reform education while maintaining, and indeed increasing, the
influence of the Catholic Church. Wittgenstein no more identified
himself with this movement, however, than he did with the Glöckel
programme. In the struggle between clericals and socialists that
dominated the public life of post-war Austria, Wittgenstein occupied an
ambivalent position. He shared with the socialists a dislike of the
Catholic establishment and a general egalitarianism, while firmly
rejecting their secularism and their faith in social and political
change. In the politically turbulent and increasingly polarized world of
the 1920s, however, such ambivalence and aloofness would always be
liable to be misunderstood: to conservative clericals, his contempt for
convention was sufficient to establish him as a socialist; to
socialists, on the other hand, his individualism and fundamentally
religious outlook identified him as a clerical reactionary.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, then, was trained within the Glöckel programme while
distancing himself from some of its objectives. He felt sufficiently
uncertain of his standing at the college to ask Hänsel what he had heard
said of him by the lecturers there. The entire faculty, Hänsel reported,
were united in their praise of him; he was regarded as a serious,
capable student-teacher, who knew just what he was doing. The teachers
of all his classes – educational theory, natural history, handwriting
and music – were all pleased with his work. ’The professor of psychology
said with great self-satisfaction that he was very pleased with the
noble Lord Wittgenstein.’57</p>
<p>Throughout his year as a student-teacher Wittgenstein saw Hänsel
regularly, sometimes in the company of their fellow prisoner of war,
Michael Drobil. With Hänsel he discussed not only educational matters,
but also philosophy. As a learned Hofrat Direktor, Hänsel maintained a
keen interest in the subject, and in his lifetime published some twenty
articles on philosophical subjects (mostly ethics). In a letter of 23
May we find him providing Wittgenstein with a summary of the three kinds
of object (actual, ideal and real) distinguished by the ‘Critical
Realist’ O. Külpe, in his book Die Realisierung. What, precisely,
Wittgenstein’s interest in this might have been must remain a mystery,
since Külpe is nowhere referred to again. However, further evidence of
Wittgenstein’s preoccupation at this time with the competing metaphysics
of idealism and realism is provided by a letter from Frege – the last
Frege is known to have written to Wittgenstein – dated 3 April.</p>
<p>Frege was evidently responding to criticisms Wittgenstein had made of
his essay ‘The Thought’, in which Wittgenstein had spoken of ‘deep
grounds’ for idealism. ‘Of course I don’t take exception to your
frankness’, Frege began:58</p>
<p>But I would like to know what deep grounds for idealism you think I
have not grasped. I take it that you yourself do not hold the idealist
theory of knowledge to be true. So, I think, you recognise that there
can, after all, be no deep grounds for this idealism. The grounds for it
can then only be apparent grounds, not logical ones.</p>
<p>The rest of this long letter is taken up with an analysis by Frege of
the lack of clarity of the Tractatus. This time he concentrates solely
on the first proposition: ‘The world is everything that is the case.’
Assuming, he argues, that the ‘is’ in this statement is the ‘is of
identity’, and further assuming that it is meant to convey information
and not simply to provide a definition of ‘the world’, then, in order
for it to mean anything, there must be some way of identifying the sense
of ‘the world’ and that of the phrase ‘everything that is the case’
independently of the statement of their identity. How is this to be
done? ‘I would be glad’, he wrote, ‘if you, by answering my questions,
could facilitate my understanding of the results of your thinking.’</p>
<p>This is the last preserved communication between the two. Frege died
four years later, presumably no nearer to understanding a word of the
famous book inspired by his own work. The ‘deep grounds’ for idealism
which Wittgenstein perceived are undoubtedly connected with the account
of the world which he gives in propositions 5.6–5.641 of the Tractatus.
‘The world is my world’, ‘I am my world.(The microcosm.)’, and yet I am
not in my world: ‘The subject does not belong to the world; rather it is
a limit of the world.’ Thus, solipsism, ‘when its implications are
followed out strictly’, coincides with pure realism: ‘The self of
solipsism shrinks to a point without extension, and there remains the
reality co-ordinated with it.’ The realism of Frege is thus seen to
coincide with the idealism of Schopenhauer and the solipsism of
Weininger.</p>
<p>It is a view that gives a philosophical underpinning to the religious
individualism adopted by Wittgenstein and Engelmann. I am my world, so
if I am unhappy about the world, the only way in which I can do anything
decisive about it is to change myself. ‘The world of the happy man is a
different one from that of the unhappy man.’</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in a sense Frege was right to find the metaphysics of
this view unintelligible. On Wittgenstein’s own theory, its expression
in words can lead only to nonsense. And yet, though he was unable to
explain it to Frege, unable to convince Russell of its truth, and unable
to find a publisher for its expression as the outcome of a Theory of
Logical Symbolism, Wittgenstein remained firmly convinced of its
unassailability. Though he had suffered greatly from ‘external’ causes
in the last year – the death of Pinsent, the defeat of the Habsburg
Empire, the problems of publishing his book – he looked only to an
‘internal’ solution. What, in the final analysis, did it matter if his
book remained unpublished? By far the most important thing was to
‘settle accounts with himself’.</p>
<p>Thus in the summer, after completing his training as a teacher and
after abandoning his book to Russell, he concentrated on what was, to
him, the most immediate task: the struggle to overcome his own
unhappiness, to combat the ‘devils within’ that pulled him away from the
‘world of the happy man’. To this end he spent the summer working as a
gardener at the Klosterneuburg Monastery, just outside Vienna. Working
solidly the whole day through seemed to act as a kind of therapy. ‘In
the evening when the work is done,’ he told Engelmann, ’I am tired, and
then I do not feel unhappy.’59 It was a job to which he could bring his
customary competénce with practical, manual tasks. One day the Abbot of
the monastery passed him while he was at work and commented: ’So I see
that intelligence counts for something in gardening too.’60</p>
<p>However, the therapy was only partially successful. ‘External’ causes
of suffering continued to confine Wittgenstein to the ‘world of the
unhappy man’. ‘Every day I think of Pinsent’, he wrote to Russell in
August. ‘He took half my life away with him. The devil will take the
other half.’61 As the summer vacation drew to an end, and his new life
as a primary school teacher beckoned, he had, he told Engelmann, ‘grim
forebodings’ about his future life:</p>
<p>For unless all the devils in hell pull the other way, my life is
bound to become very sad if not impossible.62</p>
<p>fn1 He was in these lodgings scarcely more than a month, but his time
there has become the subject of a heated controversy following claims
made by the writer William Warren Bartley III. See here.</p>
<p>fn2 So it was believed, anyway, by certain members of the Sjögren and
Wittgenstein families, who (according to Brian McGuinness, op. cit.
p. 285) thereafter avoided inviting Mima and Wittgenstein to the same
occasions.</p>
<p>fn3 Since the publication of Bartley’s book it has become natural to
interpret these self-admonitions as being in some way connected with the
alleged ‘Prater episodes’. If there is any connection, however,
Engelmann himself was unaware of it. In a diary entry written after
Wittgenstein’s death, he remarks that he is often asked about
Wittgenstein’s homosexuality, but can say nothing about it – he and
Wittgenstein did not discuss such things.</p>
