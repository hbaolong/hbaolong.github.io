<h4 id="storeys-end">27 STOREYS END</h4>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN ARRIVED AT the Bevans’ home resigned to the fact that he
would do no more work. He had written nothing since his visit to Norway,
and now that he had been forced to give up the idea of living and
working by the side of the Sogne fjord, his only wish was that these
unproductive last months of his life should be few in number. ‘I can’t
even think of work at present’, he wrote to Malcolm, ’andandandand it
doesn’t matter, if only I don’t live too long!’1</p>
<p>Mrs Bevan was initially somewhat frightened of Wittgenstein,
especially after their first meeting, which was something of an ordeal
for her. Before Wittgenstein moved into their house, Dr Bevan had
invited him for supper to introduce him to his wife. She had been warned
by her husband that Wittgenstein was not one for small talk and that she
should be careful not to say anything thoughtless. Playing it safe, she
remained silent throughout most of the evening. But when Wittgenstein
mentioned his visit to Ithaca, she chipped in cheerfully: ‘How lucky for
you to go to America!’ She realized at once she had said the wrong
thing. Wittgenstein fixed her with an intent stare: ’What do you mean,
lucky?’2</p>
<p>After Wittgenstein had been there a few days, however, she began to
relax in his company, and eventually they became close friends. Not that
he was a particularly easy guest:</p>
<p>He was very demanding and exacting although his tastes were very
simple.3 It was understood that his bath would be ready, his meals on
time and that the events of the day would run to a regular pattern.</p>
<p>It was also understood that Wittgenstein should pay for nothing while
he was there – not even for the items on the shopping lists that he
would leave lying on the table for Mrs Bevan to collect when she went
out. These items would include food and books, and, of course, every
month, Street andandandand Smith’s Detective Story Magazine.</p>
<p>When they had become friends, Wittgenstein and Mrs Bevan would, as
part of the regular pattern of each day, walk to the local pub at six
o’clock in the evening. Mrs Bevan remembers: ‘We always ordered two
ports, one I drank and the other one he poured with great amusement into
the Aspidistra plant – this was the only dishonest act I ever knew him
to do.’ Conversation with Wittgenstein was, in spite of her first
experience of him, surprisingly easy: ‘It was remarkable that he never
discussed or tried to discuss with me, subjects which I did not
understand, so that in our relationship I never felt inferior or
ignorant.’ This is not to say, however, that the significance of all his
remarks was always transparently clear; perhaps the most gnomic was his
comment on Peter Geach, Elizabeth Anscombe’s husband. When Mrs Bevan
asked Wittgenstein what Geach was like, he replied solemnly: ‘He reads
Somerset Maugham.’</p>
<p>In February Wittgenstein wrote to Fouracre:</p>
<p>I have been ill for some time, about 6 weeks, andandandand have to
spend part of the day in bed.4 I don’t know when I’ll come to London
again. If there’s no chance of it I’ll let you know andandandand you
might be able to visit me here on a Sunday sometime.</p>
<p>He does not tell Fouracre that he has cancer, and as his condition
deteriorated sharply soon after this letter was written, it is unlikely
that Wittgenstein met Fouracre again in London. But the fact that it
should even have been suggested at this stage illustrates how important
to him his meetings with his ex-colleague at Guy’s had become.</p>
<p>At the end of February it was decided that there was no further point
in continuing Wittgenstein’s hormone and X-ray treatment. This, even
when accompanied by the information that he could not expect to live
more than a few months, came as an enormous relief to him. He told Mrs
Bevan: ‘I am going to work now as I have never worked before.’
Remarkably, he was right. During the two months left of his life
Wittgenstein wrote over half (numbered paragraphs 300–676) of the
remarks which now constitute On Certainty, and in doing so produced what
many people regard as the most lucid writing to be found in any of his
work.</p>
<p>The work picks up the threads of Wittgenstein’s earlier discussions
of Moore’s ‘Defence of Common Sense’, but explores the issues in much
greater depth, and expresses the ideas with much greater clarity and
succinctness than hitherto. Even when he is chiding himself for his own
lack of concentration, he does so with an amusingly apt simile: ‘I do
philosophy now like an old woman who is always mislaying something and
having to look for it again: now her spectacles, now her keys.’5 Despite
this self-deprecation, he was in no doubt that the work he was now
writing would be of interest: ‘I believe it might interest a
philosopher, one who can think himself, to read my notes.6 For even if I
have hit the mark only rarely, he would recognize what target I had been
ceaselessly aiming at.’</p>
<p>The target he was aiming at was the point at which doubt becomes
senseless – the target at which he believed Moore to have made an
inaccurate shot. We cannot doubt everything, and this is true not only
for practical reasons, like insufficient time or having better things to
do; it is true for the intrinsic, logical reason that: ‘A doubt without
an end is not even a doubt.’ But we do not reach that end with
statements that begin: ‘I know …’ Such statements have a use only in the
‘stream of life’; outside of it, they appear absurd:7</p>
<p>I am sitting with a philosopher in the garden; he says again and
again ‘I know that that’s a tree’, pointing to a tree that is near us.8
Someone else arrives and hears this, and I tell them: ‘This fellow isn’t
insane. We are only doing philosophy.’</p>
<p>We reach the end of doubt, rather, in practice: ‘Children do not
learn that books exist, that armchairs exist, etc., etc., – they learn
to fetch books, sit in armchairs, etc. etc.’ Doubting is a rather
special sort of practice, which can be learnt only after a lot of
non-doubting behaviour has been acquired: ’Doubting and non-doubting
behaviour. There is a first only if there is a second.’9 The thrust of
Wittgenstein’s remarks is to focus the attention of philosophers away
from words, from sentences, and on to the occasions in which we use
them, the contexts which give them their sense:</p>
<p>Am I not getting closer and closer to saying that in the end logic
cannot be described? You must look at the practice of language, then you
will see it.10</p>
<p>His attitude is summed up by Goethe’s line in Faust: ‘Im Anfang war
die Tat’ (‘In the beginning was the deed’), which he quotes with
approval, and which might, with some justification, be regarded as the
motto of On Certainty – and, indeed, of the whole of Wittgenstein’s
later philosophy.</p>
<p>The last remark of On Certainty was written on 27 April, the day
before Wittgenstein finally lost consciousness. The day before that was
his sixty-second birthday. He knew it would be his last. When Mrs Bevan
presented him with an electric blanket, saying as she gave it to him:
‘Many happy returns’, he stared hard at her and replied: ‘There will be
no returns.’ He was taken violently ill the next night, after he and Mrs
Bevan had returned from their nightly stroll to the pub. When told by Dr
Bevan that he would live only a few more days, he exclaimed ‘Good!’ Mrs
Bevan stayed with him the night of the 28th, and told him that his close
friends in England would be coming the next day. Before losing
consciousness he said to her: ‘Tell them I’ve had a wonderful life.’</p>
<p>The next day Ben, Anscombe, Smythies and Drury were gathered at the
Bevans’ home to be with Wittgenstein at his death. Smythies had brought
with him Father Conrad, but no one would decide whether Conrad should
say the usual office for the dying and give conditional absolution,
until Drury recollected Wittgenstein’s remark that he hoped his Catholic
friends prayed for him. This decided the matter, and they all went up to
Wittgenstein’s room and kneeled down while Conrad recited the proper
prayers. Shortly after this, Dr Bevan pronounced him dead.</p>
<p>The next morning he was given a Catholic burial at St Giles’s Church,
Cambridge. The decision to do this was again prompted by a recollection
of Drury’s. He told the others:</p>
<p>I remember that Wittgenstein once told me of an incident in Tolstoy’s
life. When Tolstoy’s brother died, Tolstoy, who was then a stern critic
of the Russian Orthodox Church, sent for the parish priest and had his
brother interred according to the Orthodox rite.11 ‘Now’, said
Wittgenstein, ‘that is exactly what I should have done in a similar
case.’</p>
<p>When Drury mentioned this, everyone agreed that all the usual Roman
Catholic prayers should be said by a priest at the graveside, although
Drury admits: ‘I have been troubled ever since as to whether what we did
then was right.’ Drury does not expand on this, but the trouble perhaps
stems from doubt as to whether the story about Tolstoy quite fits the
occasion. For the point of the story is that, although not himself an
adherent of the Orthodox Church, Tolstoy had the sensitivity to respect
his brother’s faith. But in Wittgenstein’s case the position is
reversed: it was Anscombe and Smythies, and not he, who adhered to the
Catholic faith.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was not a Catholic. He said on a number of occasions,
both in conversation and in his writings, that he could not bring
himself to believe the things that Catholics believe. Nor, more
important, did he practise Catholicism. And yet there seems to be
something appropriate in his funeral being attended by a religious
ceremony. For, in a way that is centrally important but difficult to
define, he had lived a devoutly religious life.</p>
<p>A few days before his death Wittgenstein was visited in Cambridge by
Drury, and remarked to him: ‘Isn’t it curious that, although I know I
have not long to live, I never find myself thinking about a “future
life”.12 All my interest is still on this life and the writing I am
still able to do.’ But if Wittgenstein did not think of a future life,
he did think of how he might be judged. Shortly before his death he
wrote:</p>
<p>God may say to me: ‘I am judging you out of your own mouth.13 Your
own actions have made you shudder with disgust when you have seen other
people do them.’</p>
<p>The reconciliation with God that Wittgenstein sought was not that of
being accepted back into the arms of the Catholic Church; it was a state
of ethical seriousness and integrity that would survive the scrutiny of
even that most stern of judges, his own conscience: ‘the God who in my
bosom dwells’.</p>
