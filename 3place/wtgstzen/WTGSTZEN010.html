<h4 id="at-the-front">7 AT THE FRONT</h4>
<p>Undoubtedly, it is the knowledge of death, and therewith the
consideration of the suffering and misery of life, that give the
strongest impulse to philosophical reflection and metaphysical
explanations of the world.</p>
<p>Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation</p>
<p>IF WITTGENSTEIN HAD spent the entire war behind the lines, the
Tractatus would have remained what it almost certainly was in its first
inception of 1915: a treatise on the nature of logic. The remarks in it
about ethics, aesthetics, the soul and the meaning of life have their
origin in precisely the ‘impulse to philosophical reflection’ that
Schopenhauer describes, an impulse that has as its stimulus a knowledge
of death, suffering and misery.</p>
<p>Towards the end of March 1916 Wittgenstein was posted, as he had long
wished, to a fighting unit on the Russian Front. He was assigned to an
artillery regiment attached to the Austrian Seventh Army, stationed at
the southernmost point of the Eastern Front, near the Romanian border.
In the few weeks that elapsed before his regiment was moved up to the
front line, he endeavoured to prepare himself, psychologically and
spiritually, to face death. ‘God enlighten me. God enlighten me. God
enlighten my soul’, he wrote on 29 March.1 On the next day: ‘Do your
best. You cannot do more: and be cheerful’:2</p>
<p>Help yourself and help others with all your strength. And at the same
time be cheerful! But how much strength should one need for oneself and
how much for the others? It is hard to live well!! But it is good to
live well. However, not my, but Thy will be done.</p>
<p>When the long-awaited moment came, however, he fell ill and was told
by his commanding officer that he may have to be left behind. ‘If that
happens’, he wrote, ’I will kill myself.’3 When, on 15 April, he was
told that he would, after all, be allowed to accompany his regiment, he
prayed: ’If only I may be allowed to risk my life in some difficult
assignment.’4 He counted the days until he would at last be in the line
of fire, and, when the time came, prayed to God for courage. He noted
that since he had been at the Front he had become completely
asexual.</p>
<p>Once at the front line he asked to be assigned to that most dangerous
of places, the observation post. This guaranteed that he would be the
target of enemy fire. ‘Was shot at’, he recorded on 29 April.5 ‘Thought
of God. Thy will be done. God be with me.’ The experience, he thought,
brought him nearer to enlightenment. On 4 May he was told that he was to
go on night-duty at the observation post. As shelling was heaviest at
night, this was the most dangerous posting he could have been given.
‘Only then’, he wrote, ‘will the war really begin for me’:6</p>
<p>And – maybe – even life. Perhaps the nearness of death will bring me
the light of life. May God enlighten me. I am a worm, but through God I
become a man. God be with me. Amen</p>
<p>During the following day in the observation post, he waited for the
night’s shelling with great anticipation. He felt ‘like the prince in
the enchanted castle’.7</p>
<p>Now, during the day, everything is quiet, but in the night it must be
frightful. Will I endure it?? Tonight will show. God be with me!!</p>
<p>The next day he reported that he had been in constant danger of his
life, but through the grace of God he had survived. ’From time to time I
was afraid. That is the fault of a false view of life.’8 Almost every
night at his post he expected to die and prayed to God not to abandon
him, to give him courage to look death squarely in the eye without fear.
Only then could he be sure that he was living decently: ’Only death
gives life its meaning.’9</p>
<p>As on the Goplana Wittgenstein preferred being in a solitary and
dangerous position to being in the company of his comrades. He needed as
much, or more, strength from God to face them as he needed to face the
enemy. They were ‘a company of drunkards, a company of vile and stupid
people’:</p>
<p>The men, with few exceptions, hate me because I am a volunteer.10 So
I am nearly always surrounded by people that hate me. And this is the
one thing that I still cannot bear. The people here are malicious and
heartless. It is almost impossible to find a trace of humanity in
them.</p>
<p>The struggle to stop himself from hating these people was, like the
struggle against fear in the face of death, a test of his faith: ’The
heart of a true believer understands everything.’11 So, he urged
himself: ’Whenever you feel like hating them, try instead to understand
them.’12 He tried, but it was obviously an effort:</p>
<p>The people around me are not so much mean as appallingly limited.13
This makes it almost impossible to work with them, because they forever
misunderstand. These people are not stupid, but limited. Within their
circle they are clever enough. But they lack character and thereby
breadth.</p>
<p>Finally, he decided that he did not hate them – but they disgusted
him all the same.</p>
<p>Throughout these first few months at the Front, from March to May,
Wittgenstein was able to write a little on logic. He continued with his
theme of the nature of functions and propositions and the need to
postulate the existence of simple objects. But he added this isolated
and interesting remark about the ‘modern conception of the world’, which
found its way unchanged into the Tractatus (6.371 and 6.372):</p>
<p>The whole modern conception of the world is founded on the illusion
that the so-called laws of nature are the explanations of natural
phenomena.14</p>
<p>Thus people today stop at the laws of nature, treating them as
something inviolable, just as God and Fate were treated in past
ages.</p>
<p>And in fact both are right and both wrong: though the view of the
ancients is clearer in so far as they have a clear and acknowledged
terminus, while the modern system tries to make it look as if everything
were explained.</p>
<p>From Frege he received a postcard encouraging him to keep up his work
on logic. ‘Your desire not to allow your intellectual work to be
abandoned’, Frege wrote, ’I find very understandable.’15 He thanked
Wittgenstein for the invitation to come to Vienna to discuss his work,
but thought it doubtful whether he would be able to make it. He hoped,
nevertheless, to be able to continue their scientific discussions in
some way or other. Wittgenstein, however, was to write little on logic
for the remainder of the war. And when Frege finally had a chance to
read the Tractatus, he was unable, in Wittgenstein’s eyes, to understand
a word of it.</p>
<p>The fighting on the Eastern Front during the months of April and May
was light, but in June Russia launched its long-expected major assault,
known, after the general who planned and led it, as the ‘Brusilov
Offensive’. Thus began some of the heaviest fighting of the entire war.
The Austrian Eleventh Army, to which Wittgenstein’s regiment was
attached, faced the brunt of the attack and suffered enormous
casualties. It was at precisely this time that the nature of
Wittgenstein’s work changed.</p>
<p>On 11 June his reflections on the foundations of logic are
interrupted with the question: ‘What do I know about God and the purpose
of life?’ He answers with a list:16</p>
<p>I know that this world exists.</p>
<p>That I am placed in it like my eye in its visual field.</p>
<p>That something about it is problematic, which we call its
meaning.</p>
<p>That this meaning does not lie in it but outside it.</p>
<p>That life is the world.</p>
<p>That my will penetrates the world.</p>
<p>That my will is good or evil.</p>
<p>Therefore that good and evil are somehow connected with the meaning
of the world.</p>
<p>The meaning of life, i.e. the meaning of the world, we can call
God.</p>
<p>And connect with this the comparison of God to a father.</p>
<p>To pray is to think about the meaning of life.</p>
<p>I cannot bend the happenings of the world to my will: I am completely
powerless.</p>
<p>I can only make myself independent of the world – and so in a certain
sense master it – by renouncing any influence on happenings.</p>
<p>These remarks are not written in code, but presented as if they
somehow belonged to the logical work that precedes them. And from this
time on reflections of this sort dominate the notebook. It is as if the
personal and the philosophical had become fused; ethics and logic – the
two aspects of the ‘duty to oneself’ – had finally come together, not
merely as two aspects of the same personal task, but as two parts of the
same philosophical work.</p>
<p>In a notebook entry of 8 July, for example, we find: ‘Fear in the
face of death is the best sign of a false, i.e. a bad life’ – not, this
time, as a statement of a personal credo but as a contribution to
philosophical thought.17</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, after he had received news that his
brother Paul had been seriously wounded and assumed that he had lost his
profession as a concert pianist, he wrote: ‘How terrible! What
philosophy will ever assist one to overcome a fact of this sort?’ Now,
it seems, having experienced the full horrors of the war for himself, he
needed, not only a religious faith, but also a philosophy.18</p>
<p>That is to say, he needed not only to believe in God – to pray to Him
for strength and for enlightenment; he needed to understand what it was
that he was believing in. When he prayed to God, what was he doing? To
whom was he addressing his prayers? Himself? The world? Fate? His answer
seems to be: all three:</p>
<p>To believe in a God means to understand the meaning of life.19</p>
<p>To believe in God means to see that the facts of the world are not
the end of the matter.</p>
<p>To believe in God means to see that life has a meaning.</p>
<p>The world is given me, i.e. my will enters the world completely from
the outside as into something that is already there.</p>
<p>(As for what my will is, I don’t know yet.)</p>
<p>However this may be, at any rate we are in a certain sense dependent,
and what we are dependent on we can call God.</p>
<p>In this sense God would simply be fate, or, what is the same thing:
The world – which is independent of our will.</p>
<p>I can make myself independent of fate.</p>
<p>There are two godheads: the world and my independent I.</p>
<p>… When my conscience upsets my equilibrium, then I am not in
agreement with Something. But what is this? Is it the world?</p>
<p>Certainly it is correct to say: Conscience is the voice of God.</p>
<p>A little later on we read: ‘How things stand, is God. God is, how
things stand.’20 By ‘how things stand’ here, he means both how they
stand in the world and how they stand in oneself. For the self is, as
Weininger and Schopenhauer had said, a microcosm of the world.</p>
<p>These thoughts seem to have forced themselves upon him – almost to
have taken him by surprise. On 7 July he recorded: ‘Colossal exertions
in the last month. Have thought a great deal on every possible
subject.21 But curiously I cannot establish the connection with my
mathematical modes of thought.’ And on 2 August he remarked about his
work – as though it had a life of its own – that it had ‘broadened out
from the foundations of logic to the essence of the world’.22</p>
<p>The connection between Wittgenstein’s thought on logic and his
reflections on the meaning of life was to be found in the distinction he
had made earlier between saying and showing. Logical form, he had said,
cannot be expressed within language, for it is the form of language
itself; it makes itself manifest in language – it has to be shown.
Similarly, ethical and religious truths, though inexpressible, manifest
themselves in life:</p>
<p>The solution to the problem of life is to be seen in the
disappearance of the problem.23</p>
<p>Isn’t this the reason why men to whom the meaning of life had become
clear after long doubting could not say what this meaning consisted
in?</p>
<p>Thus: ’Ethics does not treat of the world. Ethics must be a condition
of the world, like logic.’24 Just as to understand logical form one must
see language as a whole, so, to understand ethics, one must see the
world as a whole. When one tries to describe what one sees from such a
view, one inevitably talks nonsense (as Wittgenstein wrote about his own
attempts to do so: ’I am aware of the complete unclarity of all these
sentences’25), but that such a view is attainable is undeniable: ’There
are, indeed, things that cannot be put into words. They make themselves
manifest. They are what is mystical.’26</p>
<p>In discussing this view of the world (the view that sees it as a
limited whole), Wittgenstein adopts the Latin phrase used by Spinoza:
sub specie aeternitatis (‘under the form of eternity’). It is the view,
not only of ethics, but also of aesthetics:</p>
<p>The work of art is the object seen sub specie aeternitatis; and the
good life is the world seen sub specie aeternitatis.27 This is the
connection between art and ethics.</p>
<p>The usual way of looking at things sees objects as it were from the
midst of them, the view sub specie aeternitatis from outside.</p>
<p>In such a way that they have the whole world as background.</p>
<p>These remarks show the unmistakable influence of Schopenhauer. In The
World as Will and Representation, Schopenhauer discusses, in a
remarkably similar way, a form of contemplation in which we relinquish
‘the ordinary way of considering things’, and ‘no longer consider the
where, the when, the why, and the whither in things, but simply the
what’:28</p>
<p>Further we do not let abstract thought, the concepts of reason, take
possession of our consciousness, but, instead of all this, devote the
whole power of our mind to perception, sink ourselves completely
therein, and let our whole consciousness be filled by the calm
contemplation of the natural object actually present, whether it be a
landscape, a tree, a rock, a crag, a building, or anything else. We lose
ourselves entirely in this object, to use a pregnant expression …</p>
<p>It was this that was in Spinoza’s mind when he wrote: Mens aeterna
est quatenus res sub specie aeternitatis [‘The mind is eternal in so far
as it conceives things from the standpoint of eternity’].</p>
<p>Whether Wittgenstein was rereading Schopenhauer in 1916, or whether
he was remembering the passages that had impressed him in his youth,
there is no doubt that the remarks he wrote in that year have a
distinctly Schopenhauerian feel. He even adopts Schopenhauer’s jargon of
Wille (‘will’) and Vorstellung (‘representation’ or, sometimes, ‘idea’),
as in:</p>
<p>As my idea is the world, in the same way my will is the
world-will.29</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s remarks on the will and the self are, in many ways,
simply a restatement of Schopenhauer’s ‘Transcendental Idealism’, with
its dichotomy between the ‘world as idea’, the world of space and time,
and the ‘world as will’, the noumenal, timeless, world of the self. The
doctrine might be seen as the philosophical equivalent of the religious
state of mind derided by Nietzsche, the morbid sensitivity to suffering
which takes flight from reality into ‘a merely “inner” world, a “real”
world, an “eternal” world’.30 When this state of mind is made the basis
of a philosophy it becomes solipsism, the view that the world and my
world are one and the same thing. Thus we find Wittgenstein saying:</p>
<p>It is true: Man is the microcosm:31</p>
<p>I am my world.</p>
<p>What distinguishes Wittgenstein’s statement of the doctrine from
Schopenhauer’s is that in Wittgenstein’s case it is accompanied by the
proviso that, when put into words, the doctrine is, strictly speaking,
nonsense: ‘what the solipsist means is quite correct; only it cannot be
said, but makes itself manifest’.32</p>
<p>He had, he thought, reached a point where Schopenhauerian solipsism
and Fregean realism were combined in the same point of view:</p>
<p>This is the way I have travelled: Idealism singles men out from the
world as unique, solipsism singles me alone out, and at last I see that
I too belong with the rest of the world, and so on the one side nothing
is left over, and on the other side, as unique, the world.33 In this way
idealism leads to realism if it is strictly thought out.</p>
<p>Frege, the thinker Wittgenstein credited with freeing him from his
earlier Schopenhauerian idealism, was not, apparently, told of his
relapse back into it. A card from Frege dated 24 June remarks again how
pleased he is that Wittgenstein is capable of scientific work. ‘I can
hardly say the same for myself’, he writes.34 His mind is occupied by
the war and by the suffering of the people he knows who are engaged in
it, one of whom had recently been injured for the second time, while
another had been killed in Poland. Of the Brusilov Offensive he says
nothing, but remarks how pleased he was at the recapture of Lemberg. In
the next card, dated 2 July, he sympathizes with Wittgenstein for the
latter’s inability to work. He, too, he says, has been incapable of
scientific work, but he hopes that after the war he and Wittgenstein can
take up again their work on logical questions. On 29 July he again
remarks on the low spirits evident from Wittgenstein’s recent
communications, and hopes to receive a card written in a better spirit
soon, but: ’I am always pleased to receive a sign of life from
you.’35</p>
<p>Nothing in these cards indicates that he was made aware of the
fundamental changes taking place in Wittgenstein’s thought at this time
– that he knew of the widening of Wittgenstein’s concerns from the
foundations of logic to the essence of the world, or of Wittgenstein’s
conviction that he had found the point at which solipsism and realism
coincide.</p>
<p>Thoughts of Pinsent had never been far from Wittgenstein’s mind
during the writing of his book. On 26 July he recorded another letter
from him. It was written in German and told Wittgenstein of the death of
Pinsent’s brother, who had been killed in France. ‘The war cannot change
our personal relationships’, Pinsent insisted; ‘it has nothing to do
with them.’36 ‘This kind, lovely letter’, Wittgenstein wrote, ‘has
opened my eyes to the way in which I live in exile here.37 It may be a
salutary exile, but I feel it now as an exile.’</p>
<p>By this time the Austrian forces had been driven back into the
Carpathian mountains, pursued by the victorious Russians. The conditions
were harsh – ‘icy cold, rain and fog’, Wittgenstein records.38 It was:
‘a life full of torment’:</p>
<p>Terribly difficult not to lose oneself. For I am a weak person. But
the spirit will help me. The best thing would be if I were already ill,
then at least I would have a bit of peace.</p>
<p>But to avoid capture or death he had to keep on the move, pursued by
the fire of the advancing Russians. ‘Was shot at’, he wrote on 24 July,
’and at every shot I winced with my whole being. I want so much to go on
living.’39</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the question of the identity of the
‘philosophical I’, the self which is the bearer of moral values, was
given a peculiar intensity. On the retreat through the Carpathian
mountains Wittgenstein discovered, probably for the first time in his
life, what it was like to lose sight of that self and to be overtaken by
an instinctual, animal, will to stay alive, a state in which moral
values were irrelevant:</p>
<p>Yesterday I was shot at.40 I was scared! I was afraid of death. I now
have such a desire to live. And it is difficult to give up life when one
enjoys it. This is precisely what ‘sin’ is, the unreasoning life, a
false view of life. From time to time I become an animal. Then I can
think of nothing but eating, drinking and sleeping. Terrible! And then I
suffer like an animal too, without the possibility of internal
salvation. I am then at the mercy of my appetites and aversions. Then an
authentic life is unthinkable.</p>
<p>For the next three weeks, his diary shows him remonstrating with
himself about this tendency to sink into a life of sin. ‘You know what
you have to do to live happily’, he told himself on 12 August.41 ‘Why
don’t you do it? Because you are unreasonable. A bad life is an
unreasonable life.’ He prayed to God for strength in the struggle
against his own weak nature.</p>
<p>Despite these self-admonitions, he in fact showed remarkable courage
throughout the campaign. During the first few days of the Brusilov
Offensive he was recommended for a decoration in recognition of his
bravery in keeping to his post, despite several times being told to take
cover. ‘By this distinctive behaviour’, the report states, ’he exercised
a very calming effect on his comrades.’42 He was quickly promoted, first
to Vormeister (a non-commissioned artillery rank similar to the British
Lance-Bombardier) and then to Korporal. Finally, towards the end of
August, when the Russian advance had ground to a halt, he was sent away
to the regiment’s headquarters in Olmütz (Olomouc), Moravia, to be
trained as an officer.</p>
<p>Before going to Olmütz Wittgenstein had a period of leave in Vienna.
There, he wrote in his diary, he felt depressed and lonely, the one
cheerful piece of news being the fact that Loos was still alive. From
Loos he received the name and address of a contact in Olmütz: an
ex-student of Loos was, at the time, convalescing at his family home
there after having been discharged from the army suffering from
tuberculosis.</p>
<p>On 28 August Wittgenstein received a letter from Frege suggesting
that they enter into a correspondence on logic. When Wittgenstein had
enough time, Frege suggested, couldn’t he write his thoughts on paper
and send them to him? He would then attempt to respond to Wittgenstein’s
thoughts by letter. ‘In this way’, wrote Frege, ’perhaps a scientific
communication between us could take place, and so at least provide some
sort of substitute for a face-to-face discussion.’43 Wittgenstein
appears not to have responded to this suggestion until after he had
completed his book. Perhaps the offer came too late; for in the autumn
of 1916 he found the discussion partner he needed to work out the new
direction of his thoughts.</p>
<p>The student Loos mentioned was Paul Engelmann, a member of a group of
young people which formed a self-consciously cultured oasis in what was
otherwise a rather culturally barren outpost of the Austro-Hungarian
empire. There was Fritz Zweig, a gifted pianist who later became first
conductor at the Berlin State Opera House, his cousin Max Zweig, a law
student and playwright, and Heinrich (‘Heini’) Groag, also a law student
and later a successful barrister. Groag was, says Engelmann, ‘one of the
wittiest men I ever met’.44 Engelmann’s brother, too, was a man of sharp
wit – later to become famous in Vienna as the cartoonist ‘Peter Eng’ –
although at this time he and Wittgenstein shared a mutual antipathy for
one another. Engelmann himself was a disciple of both Adolf Loos and
Karl Kraus. After his discharge from the army he devoted himself to
assisting Kraus in his campaign against the war, helping to collect the
newspaper cuttings that formed the material for Kraus’s satirical
anti-war propaganda.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein arrived in Olmütz some time in October 1916, and stayed
there until shortly before Christmas. He wanted at first to lodge in the
tower of Olmütz Town Hall, but upon being told by the watchman that it
was not to let, he settled for a room in a tenement block on the
outskirts of town. Shortly after moving in, he fell ill with enteritis,
and was nursed back to health by Engelmann, with the help of Engelmann’s
mother, who cooked Wittgenstein light meals, which Engelmann would then
deliver to the invalid. On the first occasion that he performed this act
of kindness Engelmann spilt some soup on his way up to Wittgenstein’s
room. On his entering, Wittgenstein exclaimed: ‘My dear friend, you are
showering me with kindness’, to which Engelmann, his coat bespattered,
replied: ’I am afraid I have been showering myself.’45 It was exactly
the sort of simple kindness and simple humour that Wittgenstein
appreciated, and the scene stayed in his mind. When he was back at the
Front he wrote to Engelmann: ’I often think of you … and of the time you
brought me some soup. But that was your mother’s fault as well as yours!
And I shall never forget her either.’46</p>
<p>Thanks to Engelmann’s group of friends, Wittgenstein’s time at Olmütz
was a happy one. He joined in with their performances of Molière’s
Malade imaginaire, listened appreciatively to Fritz Zweig’s piano
recitals and, above all, he joined in with their conversations – about
literature, music and religion. With Engelmann particularly he was able
to discuss with a sympathetic and like-minded listener all the ideas
that had come to him during the last six months at the Front. Sometimes,
Engelmann recalls, these conversations would be conducted while he was
accompanying Wittgenstein on his way back from Engelmann’s house to his
room on the outskirts of town. If they were still engrossed in
discussion by the time they reached the tenement block, they would turn
round and continue the conversation while Wittgenstein accompanied
Engelmann back.</p>
<p>Engelmann was the closest friend Wittgenstein had had since leaving
England. The friendship owed much to the fact that the two met each
other at a time when both were experiencing a religious awakening which
they each interpreted and analysed in a similar way. Engelmann puts it
well when he says that it was his own spiritual predicament that:</p>
<p>… enabled me to understand, from within as it were, his utterances
that mystified everyone else.47 And it was this understanding on my part
that made me indispensable to him at that time.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein himself used to say: ’If I can’t manage to bring forth a
proposition, along comes Engelmann with his forceps and pulls it out of
me.’48</p>
<p>The image brings to mind Russell’s remark about dragging
Wittgenstein’s thoughts out of him with pincers. And, indeed, it is hard
to resist comparing Engelmann and Russell with respect to the roles they
played in Wittgenstein’s life during the development of the Tractatus.
Engelmann himself seems to have had the comparison in mind when he wrote
that:</p>
<p>In me Wittgenstein unexpectedly met a person, who, like many members
of the younger generation, suffered acutely under the discrepancy
between the world as it is and as it ought to be according to his
lights, but who tended also to seek the source of that discrepancy
within, rather than outside himself.49 This was an attitude which he had
not encountered elsewhere and which, at the same time, was vital for any
true understanding or meaningful discussion of his spiritual
condition.</p>
<p>And of Russell’s introduction to the book, he says:</p>
<p>[It] may be considered one of the main reasons why the book, though
recognized to this day as an event of decisive importance in the field
of logic, has failed to make itself understood as a philosophical work
in the wider sense.50 Wittgenstein must have been deeply hurt to see
that even such outstanding men, who were also helpful friends of his,
were incapable of understanding his purpose in writing the
Tractatus.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this is anachronistic. It shows, too, little
awareness of the fact that the Wittgenstein Engelmann met in 1916 was
not the same as the Wittgenstein Russell had met in 1911. Nor was his
purpose in writing the Tractatus the same. Russell was not in touch with
Wittgenstein at a time when his work ‘broadened out from the foundations
of logic to the essence of the world’; so far as Russell knew, his
purpose in writing the book was to shed light on the nature of logic.
Engelmann, one might say, would have been little use to Wittgenstein’s
development as a philosopher in 1911, when his preoccupations centred on
the issues raised by Russell’s Paradox.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it remains true that in 1916 – just as in 1911 –
Wittgenstein was fortunate to be in a situation in which he could have
daily conversations with, and the almost undivided attention of, a
kindred spirit.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that there are no coded remarks in Wittgenstein’s
notebook for this time; Engelmann’s presence made them unnecessary.
There are, however, a number of philosophical remarks. In the main these
are a continuation of the Schopenhauerian line of thought begun at the
Front. It is likely, I think, that his protracted conversations with
Engelmann helped Wittgenstein to formulate the connections between the
mystical and the logical parts of the book. Certainly he discussed the
book in depth with Engelmann, and from the latter’s ‘Observations on the
Tractatus’ included in his memoir it is clear that it had been firmly
impressed upon him that: ‘logic and mysticism have here sprung from the
same root’. The central thread that links the logic and the mysticism –
the idea of the unutterable truth that makes itself manifest – was an
idea that came naturally to Engelmann. Indeed, he later supplied
Wittgenstein with what both considered to be an excellent example: a
poem by Uhland called ‘Count Eberhard’s Hawthorn’.</p>
<p>After spending Christmas in Vienna Wittgenstein returned to the
Russia Front in January 1917, now an artillery officer attached to a
division of the Austrian Third Army stationed just north of the
Carpathian mountains. By now the Russians were in disarray and the Front
was relatively quiet. He wrote to Engelmann that he was once again
capable of work (unfortunately, the manuscripts from this period have
not survived). In all probability the work he wrote at this time was
concerned with the inexpressibility of ethical and aesthetic truths. In
a letter dated 4 April 1917, Engelmann enclosed ‘Count Eberhard’s
Hawthorn’, Uhland’s poem recounting the story of a soldier who, while on
crusade, cuts a spray from a hawthorn bush; when he returns home he
plants the sprig in his grounds, and in old age he sits beneath the
shade of the fully grown hawthorn tree, which serves as a poignant
reminder of his youth. The tale is told very simply, without adornment
and without drawing any moral. And yet, as Engelmann says, ‘the poem as
a whole gives in 28 lines the picture of a life’.51 It is, he told
Wittgenstein, ‘a wonder of objectivity’:</p>
<p>Almost all other poems (including the good ones) attempt to express
the inexpressible, here that is not attempted, and precisely because of
that it is achieved.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein agreed. The poem, he wrote to Engelmann, is indeed
‘really magnificent’:52</p>
<p>And this is how it is: if only you do not try to utter what is
unutterable then nothing gets lost. But the unutterable will be –
unutterably – contained in what has been uttered!</p>
<p>There was, at this time, some reason to think that the war might soon
come to an end through a victory for the Central Powers. The government
in Russia had collapsed; there had been a breakthrough for the Germans
against the French on the Western Front; and the U-Boat campaign against
the British seemed to be succeeding. So, at least, Frege thought. ‘Let’s
hope for the best!’ he wrote to Wittgenstein on 26 April, listing all
these reasons for doing so.53</p>
<p>During the quiet time that followed the Russian Revolution,
Wittgenstein was given some leave in Vienna. There Frege wrote to him,
apologizing for having to refuse his invitation to come to Vienna to
discuss his work. ‘The journey to Vienna and back again’, he explained,
’is, under my present circumstances, too strenuous.’54 It was clear that
if Wittgenstein wanted to discuss his work with Frege, he would have to
go to Jena.</p>
<p>In the event, the collapse of the Tsarist government was to lead,
initially, to renewed activity on the Eastern Front. The new Minister of
War (and, from July, the new Prime Minister), Alexander Kerensky, was
determined to continue the struggle, and in July the Russians launched
the ill-fated offensive named after him. The will to prolong the war on
the part of the ordinary soldiers had, however, by this time been
dissipated, and the Russian advance soon ground to a halt. Wittgenstein
was awarded the Silver Medal for Valour for his part in the stand made
by the Austro-Hungarian forces in defence of their positions at Ldziany.
In the counter-offensive that followed he took part in the advance along
the line of the river Pruth which led, in August, to the capture of the
city of Czernowitz (Chernovtsy) in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>The Russian war effort had by this time completely collapsed, and
with it the Kerensky government. The war in the East had been won by the
Central Powers. After coming to power with a slogan of ‘Bread and
Peace’, it remained only for the new Bolshevik government to salvage
whatever they could from their inevitable surrender. Throughout the long
drawn out negotiations that followed, Wittgenstein remained stationed in
the Ukraine, and it was not until 3 March 1918, when Lenin and Trotsky
finally gave their signatures to the draconian terms of the Treaty of
Brest Litovsk, that he, along with the bulk of the Austro-Hungarian
forces, was transferred to the Italian Front.</p>
<p>During these six months of effectively non-combatant service, he
seems to have begun the work of arranging his philosophical remarks into
something like the form they finally took in the Tractatus. The
manuscript of an early version of the book (published as Prototractatus)
appears to date from this time, and we have it from Engelmann that a
typed copy of the book existed before Wittgenstein left for Italy. This
cannot have been the final version, but it is clear that during the
winter of 1917–18 the work was beginning to take its final shape.</p>
<p>During this time Wittgenstein was in communication with both Frege
and Engelmann. Frege wrote cards expressing the by now customary wish
that he and Wittgenstein would be able to meet to discuss logic after
the war. Engelmann, who was at this time employed by the Wittgenstein
family to make alterations to their house in the Neuwaldeggergasse,
wrote on more personal matters. On 8 January 1918 he was bold enough to
make an observation on Wittgenstein’s spiritual condition. It was, he
said, something he had wanted to say when the two met in Vienna during
the Christmas vacation, but had neglected to do so. ‘If in saying it, I
do you an injustice, forgive me’:55</p>
<p>It seemed to me as if you – in contrast to the time you spent in
Olmütz, where I had not thought so – had no faith. I write this not in
an attempt to influence you. But I ask you to consider what I say, and
wish for you, that you do what is in your true best interests.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s reply to this is remarkably forbearing. ‘It is true’,
he wrote, ‘that there is a difference between myself as I am now and as
I was when we met in Olmütz. And, as far as I know, the difference is
that I am now slightly more decent.56 By this I only mean that I am
slightly clearer in my own mind about my lack of decency’:</p>
<p>If you tell me now I have no faith, you are perfectly right, only I
did not have it before either. It is plain, isn’t it, that when a man
wants, as it were, to invent a machine for becoming decent, such a man
has no faith. But what am I to do? I am clear about one thing: I am far
too bad to be able to theorize about myself; in fact I shall either
remain a swine or else I shall improve, and that’s that! Only let’s cut
out the transcendental twaddle when the whole thing is as plain as a
sock on the jaw.</p>
<p>‘I am sure you are quite right in all you say’, the letter ends.
Engelmann had, it seems, at one and the same time spoken twaddle and
spoken the truth. It was a combination that Wittgenstein was also to
attribute to his own words in the Tractatus, but which Russell, as a
logician, was to find deeply unsatisfying.</p>
<p>On 1 February 1918 Wittgenstein was promoted Leutnant, and on 10
March he transferred to a mountain artillery regiment fighting on the
Italian Front. His book now almost complete, he wrote to Frege on 25
March acknowledging the great debt his work owed to the elderly, and
still much neglected, logician. Frege replied that he was astonished to
read such an effusive acknowledgement:</p>
<p>Each of us, I think, has taken something from others in our
intellectual work.57 If I have furthered your endeavours more than I
thought I had, then I am very pleased to have done so.</p>
<p>In the preface to the final version of the book, Wittgenstein repeats
that he is indebted ‘to Frege’s great works and to the writings of my
friend Mr Bertrand Russell for much of the stimulation of my
thoughts’.</p>
<p>Within a month of arriving in Italy Wittgenstein fell ill with the
enteritis that had troubled him in Olmütz, and sent away to Engelmann
for the medicine he had been given then – ‘the only one that has ever
helped me’. Engelmann was slow to reply, and when on 28 May he finally
put pen to paper, it was to ask Wittgenstein whether he knew of any
remedy for a weakness of the will! His letter crossed with a parcel of
books sent by Wittgenstein: ‘which you don’t deserve as you are too lazy
even to answer an urgent enquiry’.58</p>
<p>In the meantime, Wittgenstein had spent some time in a military
hospital in Bolzano, where he was presumably able to continue work on
his book. A letter from Frege of 1 June remarks how pleased he is that
Wittgenstein’s work is coming to a conclusion, and that he hopes it will
all soon be down on paper ‘so that it doesn’t get lost’.59</p>
<p>On the same day Adele Jolles wrote to him in a slightly wounded tone,
apologizing for bothering him with another letter when he was so
contemptuous of letters and so reluctant to engage in a superficial
exchange. The Jolles family were perhaps the first, but by no means the
last, of Wittgenstein’s friends to fall victim to the changes in him
wrought by his experience of war.</p>
<p>By the time of the Austrian offensive of 15 June Wittgenstein was fit
enough to take part, and was employed as an observer with the artillery
attacking French, British and Italian troops in the Trentino mountains.
Once again he was cited for his bravery. ‘His exceptionally courageous
behaviour, calmness, sang-froid, and heroism’, ran the report, ’won the
total admiration of the troops.’60 He was recommended for the Gold Medal
for Valour, the Austrian equivalent of the Victoria Cross, but was
awarded instead the Band of the Military Service Medal with Swords, it
being decided that his action, though brave, had been insufficiently
consequential to merit the top honour. The attack, which was to be the
last in which Wittgenstein took part, and indeed the last of which the
Austrian army was capable, was quickly beaten back. In July, after the
retreat, he was given a long period of leave that lasted until the end
of September.</p>
<p>It was not in Vienna, but at Wittgenstein’s Uncle Paul’s house in
Hallein, near Salzburg, that what we now know as Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus received its final form. One day in the summer of
1918 Paul Wittgenstein came across his nephew unexpectedly at a railway
station. He found him desperately unhappy and intent on committing
suicide, but managed to persuade him to come to Hallein. There
Wittgenstein finished his book.</p>
<p>The most likely cause of this suicidal wish is a letter from Mrs
Ellen Pinsent, dated 6 July, written to inform Wittgenstein of the death
of her son, David, who had been killed in an aeroplane accident on 8
May. He had been engaged in research on aerodynamics, and had died
investigating the cause of a previous accident. ‘I want to tell you’,
she wrote, ‘how much he loved you and valued your friendship up to the
last.’61 It was to David’s memory that Wittgenstein dedicated the
completed book. David was, he wrote to Mrs Pinsent, ‘my first and my
only friend’:62</p>
<p>I have indeed known many young men of my own age and have been on
good terms with some, but only in him did I find a real friend, the
hours I have spent with him have been the best in my life, he was to me
a brother and a friend. Daily I have thought of him and have longed to
see him again. God will bless him. If I live to see the end of the war I
will come and see you and we will talk of David.</p>
<p>‘One thing more,’ he added. ‘I have just finished the philosophical
work on which I was already at work at Cambridge’:</p>
<p>I had always hoped to be able to show it to him some time, and it
will always be connected with him in my mind. I will dedicate it to
David’s memory. For he always took great interest in it, and it is to
him I owe far the most part of the happy moods which made it possible
for me to work.</p>
<p>This last, as we have seen, refers not only to the time they spent
together in Cambridge, Iceland and Norway, but also to the letters that
Pinsent wrote during the war, which were, at times, the only things
capable of reviving Wittgenstein’s spirits sufficiently to enable him to
concentrate on philosophy.</p>
<p>Now, having finished the book – having solved the problems he had set
out to solve – what struck him most forcibly was the relative
unimportance of the task that he had achieved. ‘The truth of the
thoughts that are here communicated’, he wrote in the preface, ‘seems to
me unassailable and definitive’; and he believed himself to have found,
‘on all essential points’, the solution to the problems of philosophy.
But:</p>
<p>… if I am not mistaken in this belief, then the second thing in which
the value of this work consists is that it shows how little is achieved
when these problems are solved.</p>
<p>He chose as a motto for the book a quotation from Kürnberger: ‘… and
anything a man knows, anything he has not merely heard rumbling and
roaring, can be said in three words’. The quotation had been used before
by Karl Kraus, and it is possible that Wittgenstein took it from Kraus,
but it is equally likely he got it straight from Kürnberger (books by
Kürnberger were among those sent by Wittgenstein to Engelmann). In any
case, it is extremely apt. The whole meaning of his book, he says in the
preface, ‘can be summed up as follows: What can be said at all can be
said clearly; and whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be
silent.’</p>
<p>In its final form, the book is a formidably compressed distillation
of the work Wittgenstein had written since he first came to Cambridge in
1911. The remarks in it, selected from a series of perhaps seven
manuscript volumes, are numbered to establish a hierarchy in which, say,
remark 2.151 is an elaboration of 2.15, which in turn elaborates the
point made in remark 2.1, and so on. Very few of the remarks are
justified with an argument; each proposition is put forward, as Russell
once put it, ‘as if it were a Czar’s ukase’.63 The Theory of Logic
worked out in Norway before the war, the Picture Theory of Propositions
developed during the first few months of the war, and the
quasi-Schopenhauerian mysticism embraced during the second half of the
war, are all allotted a place within the crystalline structure, and are
each stated with the kind of finality that suggests they are all part of
the same incontrovertible truth.</p>
<p>Central to the book in all its aspects is the distinction between
showing and saying: it is at once the key to understanding the
superfluity of the Theory of Types in logic and to realizing the
inexpressibility of ethical truths. What the Theory of Types attempts to
say can be shown only by a correct symbolism, and what one wants to say
about ethics can be shown only by contemplating the world sub specie
aeternitatis. Thus: ’There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows
itself; it is the mystical.’64</p>
<p>The famous last sentence of the book – ‘Whereof one cannot speak,
thereof one must be silent’ – expresses both a logico-philosophical
truth and an ethical precept.</p>
<p>To this extent, as Engelmann has pointed out, the book’s central
message is allied to the campaign of Karl Kraus to preserve the purity
of language by exposing to ridicule the confused thought that stems from
its misuse. The nonsense that results from trying to say what can only
be shown is not only logically untenable, but ethically undesirable.</p>
<p>On completion of the book Wittgenstein evidently considered these
ethical implications to be as important, if not more so, as its
implications for logical theory. He wanted it published alongside the
work of Kraus. And as soon as it was finished, he sent it to Kraus’s
publisher, Jahoda, seemingly expecting the relevance of it to Kraus’s
work to be readily apparent. At the same time he wrote to Frege offering
to send him a copy. In a letter of 12 September Frege says that he would
indeed be pleased to see it. He could understand, he wrote,
Wittgenstein’s feeling that the work might prove fruitless: when one has
forged a path up a steep mountain that no one has climbed before, there
must be a doubt as to whether anyone else will have the desire to follow
one up it. He knew that doubt himself. And yet he had confidence that
his work had not all been in vain. In a later letter (15 October) he
writes: ’May it be granted to you to see your work in print, and to me
to read it!’65</p>
<p>Engelmann, too, was promised a copy. Towards the end of September,
immediately before he returned to Italy, Wittgenstein travelled to
Olmütz, and it was then that Engelmann read the book for the first time.
In a letter to Wittgenstein of 7 November he mentions that he often
reads in it: ‘and it gives me more and more joy, the more I understand
it’.66</p>
<p>At the end of September Wittgenstein returned to the Italian Front,
and for the next month waited impatiently to hear from Jahoda. ‘Still no
reply from the publisher!’ he wrote to Engelmann on 22 October:67</p>
<p>And I feel an insuperable repugnance against writing to him with a
query. The devil knows what he is doing with my manuscript. Please be so
very kind and look up the damned blighter some day when you are in
Vienna, and then let me know the result!</p>
<p>A few days later he was informed that Jahoda could not publish the
work, ‘for technical reasons’.68 ‘I would dearly like to know what Kraus
said about it’, he told Engelmann. ‘If there were an opportunity for you
to find out, I should be very glad. Perhaps Loos knows something about
it.’</p>
<p>By the time Wittgenstein returned to Italy, the Austro-Hungarian
Empire was beginning to break up. The allegiance of the Czechs, the
Poles, the Croats and the Hungarians that made up the bulk of its army
was no longer given to the Habsburg Empire (in so far as it ever had
been), but to the various national states, the creation of which had
been promised to them not only by the Allies, but by the Habsburg
Emperor himself. After the final Allied breakthrough of 30 October,
before any armistice had been signed, large numbers of the men formed
themselves into groups of compatriots and simply turned their back on
the war, making their way home instead to help found their new nations.
Austrian officers frequently found that they had no control whatsoever
over the troops that were still nominally under their command. One
casualty of this situation was Wittgenstein’s brother, Kurt, who in
October or November shot himself when the men under him refused to obey
his orders.</p>
<p>The Austrians could do nothing but sue for peace, a process which the
Italians, presented with a golden opportunity to collect booty and win
back territory, were in no mind to hurry. On 29 October an Austrian
delegation, carrying a flag of truce, approached the Italians but was
sent back because it lacked the proper credentials. It was not until
five days later that an armistice was finally signed. In the meantime
the Italians had taken about 7000 guns and about 500,000 prisoners –
Wittgenstein among them.</p>
<p>Upon capture, he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Como. There
he met two fellow officers, who were to remain valuable friends in the
years to come: the sculptor Michael Drobil and the teacher Ludwig
Hänsel. A story told by Hermine Wittgenstein relates that Drobil had
assumed from his ragged and unassuming appearance that Wittgenstein was
from a humble background. One day their conversation turned to a
portrait by Klimt of a certain Fräulein Wittgenstein. To Drobil’s
amazement, Wittgenstein referred to the painting as ‘the portrait of my
sister’.69 He stared in disbelief: ‘Then you’re a Wittgenstein are
you?’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein got to know Hänsel after attending a class on logic that
Hänsel was giving to prisoners who hoped upon release to train as
teachers. This led to regular discussions between them, during which
Wittgenstein led Hänsel through the elements of symbolic logic and
explained the ideas of the Tractatus to him. They also read Kant’s
Critique of Pure Reason together.</p>
<p>In January 1919 Wittgenstein (together with Hänsel and Drobil) was
transferred to another camp, in Cassino. There they were to remain, as
bargaining material for the Italians, until August.</p>
<p>It was while he was held at Cassino that Wittgenstein made the
decision that, on return to Vienna, he would train as an elementary
school teacher. According to the writer Franz Parak, however, with whom
Wittgenstein enjoyed a brief friendship at the prisoner-of-war camp,
Wittgenstein would most have liked to have become a priest ’and to have
read the Bible with the children’70.fn1</p>
<p>In February Wittgenstein was able to write a card to Russell. ‘I am
prisoner in Italy since November’, he told him, ‘and hope I may
communicate with you after a three years interruption.71 I have done
lots of logical work which I am dying to let you know before publishing
it.’</p>
<p>The card somehow managed to reach Russell at Garsington Manor, where
he was staying as a guest of Ottoline Morrell and endeavouring to finish
The Analysis of Mind, which had been started in Brixton Prison the
previous year.</p>
<p>Russell had had, in his way, almost as difficult a time as
Wittgenstein. At forty-two, he was too old to fight, but given his
implacable opposition to the war he would not have volunteered anyway.
His opposition to the war had caused him to be sacked from his
lectureship by Trinity College, and had brought him briefly into an
uneasy and emotionally fraught collaboration with D. H. Lawrence, which,
when it ended, left him with a much firmer distaste for the irrational
and impulsive sides of human nature than he had had hitherto.</p>
<p>He had campaigned tirelessly against conscription and published
numerous political essays, one of which brought against him the charge
of prejudicing relations between Britain and the United States. For this
he was imprisoned for six months. To the public he was now better known
as a political campaigner than as a philosopher/mathematician.
Principles of Social Reconstruction and Roads to Freedom enjoyed a far
wider readership than had Principles of Mathematics and Principia
Mathematica. In prison, however, he returned to philosophical work,
writing the Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy and beginning The
Analysis of Mind. Now, in temporary retirement from public controversy
and taking advantage of the peaceful surroundings offered at Garsington
to reorientate himself back into philosophical thought, he was only too
pleased to re-establish communication with Wittgenstein. He dashed off
two cards on successive days:</p>
<p>Most thankful to hear you are still alive.72 Please write on Logic,
when possible. I hope it will not be long now before a talk will be
possible. I too have very much to say about philosophy, etc.
[2.3.19]</p>
<p>Very glad to hear from you – had been anxious for a long time.73 I
shall be interested to learn what you have done in Logic. I hope before
long it may be possible to hear all about it. Shall be glad of further
news – about your health etc. [3.3.19]</p>
<p>‘You can’t imagine how glad I was to receive your cards!’
Wittgenstein replied, adding that, unless Russell were prepared to
travel to Cassino, there was no hope of their meeting ‘before long’.74
He could not write on logic, as he was allowed only two cards a week,
but he explained the essential point: ‘I’ve written a book which will be
published as soon as I get home. I think I have solved our problems
finally.’75 A few days later he was able, after all, to expand on this,
when, thanks to a student who was on his way back to Austria, he had the
opportunity to post a full-length letter. ‘I’ve written a book called
“Logisch-Philosophische Abhandlung” containing all my work of the last
six years’, he explained:</p>
<p>I believe I’ve solved our problems finally. This may sound arrogant
but I can’t help believing it. I finished the book in August 1918 and
two months after was made Prigioniere. I’ve got the manuscript here with
me. I wish I could copy it out for you; but it’s pretty long and I would
have no safe way of sending it to you. In fact you would not understand
it without a previous explanation as it’s written in quite short
remarks. (This of course means that nobody will understand it; although
I believe, it’s all as clear as crystal. But it upsets all our theory of
truth, of classes, of numbers and all the rest.) I will publish it as
soon as I get home.</p>
<p>He repeated that he expected to be in the camp for some time. But, he
asked speculatively: ‘I suppose it would be impossible for you to come
and see me here?’</p>
<p>… or perhaps you think it’s colossal cheek of me even to think of
such a thing. But if you were on the other end of the world and I could
come to you I would do it.</p>
<p>In fact, it was impossible for Russell to visit him at Cassino,
although, as it turned out, Wittgenstein himself was given an
opportunity to leave the camp. Through a relative with connections in
the Vatican, strings were pulled to get him released by the Italians. He
was to be examined by a doctor and declared medically unfit to stand
prolonged confinement. Wittgenstein, however, rejected such privileged
treatment, and at the examination insisted vehemently that he was in
perfect health.</p>
<p>Russell also pulled strings, and through Keynes (who was at this time
with the British delegation at the Versailles Peace Conference) managed
to get permission for Wittgenstein to receive books and to be excepted
from the rule allowing him only two postcards a week, so that he could
engage in learned correspondence. These privileges Wittgenstein did not
refuse. They made it possible for him both to send his manuscript to
Russell and to receive Russell’s newly published book, Introduction to
Mathematical Philosophy, which Russell regarded as having been
influenced by his reading of Wittgenstein’s Notes on Logic.fn2</p>
<p>To Wittgenstein, however, the book was confirmation of his suspicion
that Russell would not be able to understand his latest work. ‘I should
never have believed’, he wrote after reading it, ‘that the stuff I
dictated to Moore in Norway six years ago would have passed over you so
completely without trace’:76</p>
<p>In short, I’m now afraid that it might be very difficult for me to
reach any understanding with you. And the small remaining hope that my
manuscript might mean something to you has completely vanished … Now
more than ever I’m burning to see it in print. It’s galling to have to
lug the completed work round in captivity and to see how nonsense has a
clear field outside! And it’s equally galling to think that no one will
understand it even if it does get printed!</p>
<p>Russell’s reply is remarkably conciliatory. ‘It is true’, he wrote,
’that what you dictated to Moore was not intelligible to me, and he
would give me no help.’77 About his book he explained:</p>
<p>Throughout the war I did not think about philosophy, until, last
summer, I found myself in prison, and beguiled my leisure by writing a
popular text-book, which was all I could do under the circumstances. Now
I am back at philosophy, and more in the mood to understand.</p>
<p>‘Don’t be discouraged’, he urged; ‘you will be understood in the
end.’</p>
<p>By the summer of 1919 the three people Wittgenstein most hoped and
expected to understand his work – Engelmann, Russell and Frege – had
each received a copy. Even on the assumption (confirmed in a later
letter to Russell) that this left Wittgenstein himself without a copy,
it is something of a mystery how he managed to make three copies of the
book.</p>
<p>In a letter of 6 April, Engelmann paid his own tribute to the book
with a friendly parody of its system of numbering:</p>
<p>No writing between the lines!78</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Dear Mr Wittgenstein, I am very pleased to hear,</p></li>
<li><p>through your family, that you are well. I</p></li>
<li><p>hope that you do not take it badly that I have</p></li>
<li><p>not written to you for so long, but I had so</p></li>
<li><p>much to write that I preferred to leave it to</p></li>
<li><p>a reunion that I hope will be soon. But I must</p></li>
<li><p>now thank you with all my heart for your</p></li>
<li><p>manuscript, a copy of which I received some time</p></li>
<li><p>ago from your sister. I think I now, on the</p></li>
<li><p>whole, understand it, at least with me you have</p></li>
<li><p>entirely fulfilled your purpose of providing</p></li>
<li><p>somebody some enjoyment through the book; I am</p></li>
<li><p>certain of the truth of your thoughts and</p></li>
<li><p>discern their meaning. Best wishes,</p></li>
<li><p>yours sincerely, Paul Engelmann</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Engelmann evidently enjoyed this, so much so that he repeated the
format in his next letter of 15 August, written to explain to
Wittgenstein why he had so far been unable to obtain a copy of Frege’s
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, which Wittgenstein had asked him to
send.</p>
<p>There are some indications that it was Frege’s response to the book
that Wittgenstein most eagerly awaited. If so, the disappointment must
have been all the more great when he received Frege’s reactions.</p>
<p>Frege’s first impressions are contained in a letter written on 28
June. He begins by apologizing for the late response, and for the fact
that, as he had had much to do, he had had little time to read
Wittgenstein’s manuscript and could therefore offer no firm judgement on
it. Almost the whole of his letter is concerned with doubts about the
precision of Wittgenstein’s language:</p>
<p>Right at the beginning I come across the expressions ‘is the case’
and ‘fact’ and I suspect that is the case and is a fact are the same.79
The world is everything that is the case and the world is the collection
of facts. Is not every fact the case and is not that which is the case a
fact? Is it not the same if I say, A is a fact, as if I say, A is the
case? Why then this double expression? … Now comes a third expression:
‘What is the case, a fact, is the existence of Sachverhalte.’ I take
this to mean that every fact is the existence of a Sachverhalt, so that
another fact is the existence of another Sachverhalt. Couldn’t one
delete the words ‘existence of’ and say ‘Every fact is a Sachverhalt,
every other fact is another Sachverhalt’. Could one perhaps also say
‘Every Sachverhalt is the existence of a fact?’</p>
<p>‘You see’, Frege wrote, ‘from the very beginning I find myself
entangled in doubt as to what you want to say, and so make no proper
headway.’ He was unsure what Wittgenstein meant by the terms Tatsache,
Sachverhalt and Sachlage, and would need, he said, examples to clarify
the terminology. Are there Sachverhalte that do not exist? Is every
collection of objects a Sachverhalt?fn3 Frege’s letter must have been a
bitter disappointment to Wittgenstein. There is nothing in it to
indicate that Frege got past the first page; his questions all relate to
the first ten or so propositions in the book, and are all concerned with
terminology rather than substance. Of Wittgenstein’s Theory of Symbolism
and its implications for the understanding of logic, Frege obviously had
no grasp at all; still less could he be expected to understand the
ethical implications of the book.</p>
<p>Despondently, Wittgenstein pinned his hopes on Russell. In a letter
of 19 August he told Russell of Frege’s response to the book: ‘I gather
he doesn’t understand a word of it’:80</p>
<p>So my only hope is to see you soon and explain all to you, for it is
VERY hard not to be understood by a single soul!</p>
<p>There were indeed reasons for hoping that Russell might, after all,
be brought to an understanding of the book. His initial reactions to it
were both more comprehending and more favourable than those of Frege. He
had at least managed to read the whole book – ‘twice carefully’ so he
told Wittgenstein. And he had, moreover, formed some idea (even if
mistaken) of what it was about. ‘I am convinced’, he wrote on 13 August,
’you are right in your main contention, that logical props are
tautologies, which are not true in the sense that substantial props are
true.’81</p>
<p>In fact, this was not the main contention of the book – at least as
Wittgenstein understood it. But, nevertheless, it showed that Russell
had understood what Wittgenstein was trying to say about logic. This
was, however, Wittgenstein explained in his letter of 19 August, only a
‘corollary’ to his main contention:</p>
<p>The main point is the theory of what can be expressed (gesagt) by
props – i.e. by language – (and, which comes to the same, what can be
thought) and what can not be expressed by props, but only shown
(gezeigt); which, I believe, is the cardinal problem of
philosophy.82</p>
<p>This links, I believe, with what Wittgenstein had meant earlier when
he said that Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy showed that the
notes he had dictated to Moore had completely ‘passed over’ Russell. For
though Russell had borrowed Wittgenstein’s notion of tautology, he had
made no use in the book of the distinction between saying and showing,
the distinction that the notes to Moore had introduced. It was not that
Russell did not understand the distinction, but rather that he thought
it obscure and unnecessary. He later called it ‘a curious kind of
logical mysticism’, and thought that, in logic at least, it could be
dispensed with by introducing a higher level language (a
‘meta-language’) to say the things that could not be said using the
original ‘object-language’.83</p>
<p>To his letter Russell appended a list of questions and doubts about
the book. Like Frege, he wanted to know what the difference was between
Tatsache and Sachverhalt. Wittgenstein gave the same answer he had given
Frege:</p>
<p>Sachverhalt is, what corresponds to an Elementarsatz (elementary
proposition) if it is true.84 Tatsache is what corresponds to the
logical product of elementary props when this product is true.</p>
<p>Most of the other queries raised by Russell in some way or other
arise from his reluctance to accept the idea that some things – logical
form, for instance – cannot be expressed in language but have to be
shown. Russell objected, for example, to Wittgenstein’s summary
dismissal of the Theory of Types in proposition 3.331: ‘The theory of
types, in my view’, he told Wittgenstein, ‘is a theory of correct
symbolism: (a) a simple symbol must not be used to express anything
complex; (b) more generally, a symbol must have the same structure as
its meaning.’85 ‘That’s exactly what one can’t say’, Wittgenstein
replied:86</p>
<p>You cannot prescribe to a symbol what it may be used to express. All
that a symbol CAN express, it MAY express. This is a short answer but it
is true!</p>
<p>In two other replies to points raised by Russell Wittgenstein
hammered home the same message:</p>
<p>… Just think that, what you want to say by the apparent prop ‘there
are two things’ is shown by there being two names which have different
meanings.87</p>
<p>… ‘It is necessary to be given the prop that all elementary props are
given.’ This is not necessary, because it is even impossible. There is
no such prop! That all elementary props are given is SHOWN by there
being none having an elementary sense which is not given.</p>
<p>Although these questions and answers relate to specific points of
logical theory, not very far behind them lies a more general and more
important difference. It is no coincidence that Russell’s insistence on
the applicability of meta-languages abolishes the sphere of the
mystical, while Wittgenstein’s insistence on the impossibility of saying
what can only be shown preserves it.</p>
<p>What was perhaps Russell’s gravest doubt, however, remained
unanswered. This concerned Wittgenstein’s brief discussion of
mathematics, and particularly his abrupt dismissal of Set Theory. ‘The
theory of classes’, he writes in proposition 6.031, ‘is completely
superfluous in mathematics.’ As this cuts at the root of everything
Russell had achieved in mathematics, he quite naturally found it
perturbing:</p>
<p>If you said classes were superfluous in logic I would imagine that I
understood you, by supposing a distinction between logic and
mathematics; but when you say they are unnecessary in mathematics I am
puzzled.88</p>
<p>To this Wittgenstein said only that it would require a lengthy
answer, and: ‘you know how difficult it is for me to write on
logic’.89</p>
<p>Of the final sections of the book, Russell had little to comment: ’I
agree with what you say about induction, causality, etc.; at least I can
find no ground for disagreeing.’90 On the remarks on ethics, aesthetics,
the soul and the meaning of life, he said nothing.</p>
<p>‘I am sure you are right in thinking the book of first-class
importance’, he concluded. ‘But in places it is obscure through
brevity’:</p>
<p>I have a most intense desire to see you, to talk it over, as well as
simply because I want to see you. But I can’t get abroad as yet.
Probably you will be free to come to England before I am free to go
abroad. – I will send back your MS when I know where to send it, but I
am hoping you will soon be at liberty.</p>
<p>The letter was sufficiently encouraging to prompt Wittgenstein to
seek a meeting as soon as possible. ‘I should like to come to England’,
he wrote, ‘but you can imagine it’s rather awkward for a German to
travel to England now.’91 The best thing would be to meet in some
neutral country – say, Holland or Switzerland. And soon. ‘The day after
tomorrow’, he told Russell, ‘we shall probably leave the Campo
Concentramento and go home. Thank God!’</p>
<p>He was released two days later, on 21 August 1919.</p>
<p>fn1 From Parak’s point of view, the friendship was all too brief.
Parak, who was seven years younger than Wittgenstein, formed a respect
for Wittgenstein that bordered on worship. He hung on to Wittgenstein’s
every word, hoping, as he says in his memoir, to drink in as much as
possible of Wittgenstein’s superior knowledge and wisdom. After a time
Wittgenstein tired of this and began to withdraw, ‘like a mimosa’, from
Parak’s attachment. Parak, he said, reminded him of his mother.</p>
<p>fn2 For the footnote acknowledging his debt, see here.</p>
<p>fn3 I have kept the German words here, because for the English reader
Frege’s confusion is compounded by differences of translation. Ogden
translates Sachverhalt as ‘atomic fact’, and Sachlage as ‘state of
affairs’; Pears and McGuinness have ‘state of affairs’ for Sachverhalt
and ‘situation’ for Sachlage. Ogden’s translation has the merit, at
least, of making it clear – as Wittgenstein had to explain to both Frege
and Russell – that Sachverhalte are what correspond to (true) atomic
propositions, and are therefore the constituent parts of Tatsachen
(facts).</p>
