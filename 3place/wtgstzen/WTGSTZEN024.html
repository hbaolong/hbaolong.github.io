<h4 id="war-work">21 WAR WORK</h4>
<p>FOR THE FIRST two years of war, a recurrent theme of conversation
with Wittgenstein was his frustration at not being able to find work
outside academic life. He found it intolerable to be teaching philosophy
while a war was being fought, and wanted more than anything else to be
able to contribute to the war effort. His chance to do so came through
his friendship with the Oxford philosopher Gilbert Ryle. Gilbert’s
brother, John Ryle, was Regius Professor of Physic at Cambridge, but in
1940 he had returned to Guy’s Hospital to help them prepare for the
Blitz. In September 1941 Wittgenstein wrote to John Ryle asking to meet
him at Guy’s. Ryle invited him to lunch, and was immediately impressed.
‘He is one of the world’s famousest philosophers’, he wrote to his
wife.1 ‘He wears an open green shirt and has a rather attractive
face’:</p>
<p>I was so interested that after years as a Trinity don, so far from
getting tarred with the same brush as the others, he is overcome by the
deadness of the place. He said to me ‘I feel I will die slowly if I stay
there. I would rather take a chance of dying quickly.’ And so he wants
to work at some humble manual job in a hospital as his war-work and will
resign his chair if necessary, but doesn’t want it talked about at all.
And he wants the job to be in a blitzed area. The works department are
prepared to take him as an odd job man under the older workmen who do
all the running repairs all over the hospital. I think he realises that
his mind works so differently to most people’s that it would be stupid
to try for any kind of war-work based on intelligence. I have written to
him tonight to tell him about this job but am not trying to persuade him
unduly.</p>
<p>Someday I must bring him and also one or two of the Canadians down to
see you.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein clearly needed no undue persuasion, for a week or so
after this letter was written he started work at Guy’s. Not, however, as
an odd-job man but as a dispensary porter.</p>
<p>John Ryle respected Wittgenstein’s wish that his change of job from
Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge to dispensary porter at Guy’s
Hospital should not be talked about, and does not seem to have mentioned
to any of the staff at Guy’s that the new porter was ‘one of the world’s
famousest philosophers’. One indication of his discretion is that
Humphrey Osmond, a good friend of Ryle’s and the editor during the war
of the in-house journal Guy’s Gazette (and therefore always on the
look-out for an interesting story), did not find out that Wittgenstein
had been at Guy’s until after the publication of Norman Malcolm’s memoir
in 1958. It is fortunate that Ryle kept his silence, for if the Gazette
had run a ‘Famous philosopher at Guy’s’ piece, there is no doubt that
Wittgenstein would have reacted with the utmost rage.</p>
<p>While he was at Guy’s, Wittgenstein lived and dined with the medical
staff at Nuffield House. (This in itself would have been enough to
distinguish him from the other porters in the hospital, because the
non-medical staff usually lived outside the hospital grounds and dined
separately from the doctors.) Shortly after his arrival at Nuffield
House, he was enthusiastically greeted at dinner by the hospital
haematologist, Dr R. L. Waterfield. Waterfield had been at Cambridge and
had attended meetings of the Moral Science Club. Upon being recognized,
Wittgenstein turned as white as a sheet and said: ‘Good God, don’t tell
anybody who I am!’ But whether through Waterfield or some other source –
and despite the fact that Guy’s Gazette never got hold of the story –
many of the staff at Guy’s knew perfectly well who Wittgenstein was.2
Everyone there who knew him at all knew him as ‘Professor
Wittgenstein’.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s job as a porter was to deliver medicines from the
dispensary to the wards, where, according to John Ryle’s wife, Miriam,
he advised the patients not to take them. His boss at the pharmacy was
Mr S. F. Izzard. When asked later if he remembered Wittgenstein as a
porter, Izzard replied: ‘Yes, very well. He came and worked here and
after working here three weeks he came and explained how we should be
running the place.3 You see, he was a man who was used to thinking.’
After a short while, he was switched to the job of pharmacy technician
in the manufacturing laboratory, where one of his duties was to prepare
Lassar’s ointment for the dermatological department. When Drury visited
Wittgenstein at Guy’s, he was told by a member of staff that no one
before had produced Lassar’s ointment of such high quality.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein arrived at Guy’s needing a friend. After the death of
Francis, and with the departure of Kirk for Bournemouth, he was
desperately lonely. He needed some sort of emotional contact. ‘One word
that comes from your heart’, he had written to Rowland Hutt on 20 August
1941, ‘would mean more to me than 3 pages out of your head!’4 And on 27
November: ‘I can’t write about Francis, and what you write about him,
though in a sense true, somehow doesn’t click with my thoughts of him.’5
He told Hutt of his job at the dispensary, how he earned twenty-eight
shillings a week and of how hard the work was. ‘I hope my body’ll be
able to stick it. My soul is very tired, andandandand isn’t at all in a
good state; I mean, not at all as it should be.’ ‘Perhaps’, he added,
‘when we see each other again it will help us in some way.’</p>
<p>It was important for Wittgenstein that if he and Hutt did meet they
should do so for long enough for it to mean something. In subsequent
letters he stressed the importance of meeting on a Sunday, the only day
on which he was not working at the hospital:</p>
<p>If, however, you can’t come on a Sunday, a week day would have to
do.6 In this case to come even half an hour too late would be unwise;
for under the circs, it’s quite easy for us to make a mess of things,
but ever so undesirable!</p>
<p>‘It is on the whole’, he explained in another letter, ‘not a good
plan for people like us to see each other hurriedly.7 If possible we
should be together leisurely.’ After Hutt had shown some hesitation
about the proposed meeting, he was told by Wittgenstein to wait three
months before they tried to see each other:</p>
<p>As long as you find it difficult to say that you want to see me, as
you write, why should you see me? I want to see people who want to see
me; andandandand if the time should come (andandandand perhaps it will
come soon) when nobody’ll want to see me, I think I’ll see nobody.8</p>
<p>The fear that his body would not be able to cope with the work of a
dispensary porter was a real one. He was, by now, fifty-two, and was
beginning to look (and feel) old. ‘When I finish work about 5’, he told
Hutt, ‘I’m so tired I often can hardly move.’ But if his body was weak,
his spirit was, in the wake of Francis’s death, almost broken. He spent
Christmas with the Barbrooke family, who owned the grocery on East Road
below Francis’s flat. It was a melancholy occasion. On New Year’s Eve,
he wrote to Hutt:</p>
<p>I feel, on the whole, lonely andandandand am afraid of the months
andandandand years to come! … I hope that you have some happiness
andandandand that you appreciate whatever you have of it more than I
did.9</p>
<p>In the New Year of 1942, John Ryle fulfilled the promise he had made
to his wife and took Wittgenstein back to their home in Sussex, to meet
her. Happily, the weekend is recorded in the diary of their son,
Anthony, who was then fourteen years old. His first impressions were not
entirely favourable:</p>
<p>Daddy and another Austrian (?) professor called Winkenstein
(spelling?) arrived at 7.30. Daddy rather tired.10 Wink is awful strange
– not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its
“tolerable”’ meaning intolerable.</p>
<p>By the end of the following day, although making a closer
approximation to the spelling of Wittgenstein’s name, Anthony was still
far from being won over by his father’s new friend:</p>
<p>In the morning Daddy, Margaret, goats, Tinker andandandand I went for
a walk. Frosty but sunny. Witkinstein spent the morning with the
evacuees. He thinks we’re terribly cruel to them.</p>
<p>We spent the afternoon argueing – he’s an impossible person everytime
you say anything he says ‘No No, that’s not the point.’ It probably
isn’t his point, but it is ours. A tiring person to listen to. After tea
I showed him round the grounds and he entreated me to be kind to the
miserable little children – he goes far too much to the other extreme –
Mommy wants them to be good citizens, he wants them to be happy.</p>
<p>The Ryles rented a farmhouse in Sussex, and the ‘miserable little
children’ were evacuees – two working-class boys from Portsmouth whom
Mrs Ryle had taken on as a political statement. They joined a group of
children she organized to knit gloves for the Russian Red Cross.
Although she looked after these children well, she evidently maintained
strict discipline among them. On occasions when John Ryle was at home,
or when they had visitors, the Ryle family, to some extent, kept a
certain distance from the evacuees – dining, for example, in separate
rooms. While Wittgenstein was staying there, he insisted on showing his
support and sympathy for the children by dining with them.</p>
<p>It is easy to see why Wittgenstein should have liked and respected
John Ryle. Like Wittgenstein, Ryle fitted uneasily into academic life at
Cambridge, and it is clear that he shared Wittgenstein’s preference for
the dangers of working in a blitzed hospital over the ‘deadness’ of
Cambridge. While at Cambridge he had been politically active, and had
stood in the 1940 election as a left-wing independent candidate. From
1938 onwards he had been active in getting Jewish doctors out of Austria
and Germany (which is presumably why Wittgenstein is described by
Anthony Ryle as ‘another Austrian professor’).</p>
<p>Ryle’s kindness is remembered with warmth and gratitude by many of
the staff who served at Guy’s during the Blitz. Many of them were young
and, unlike Ryle, who had served in the First World War, had had no
experience of war. Humphrey Osmond’s memories of the dangers of working
at Guy’s during the heavy bombing – and Ryle’s inspiration in helping
the staff to cope with those dangers – are typical:</p>
<p>The hospital had scores of firebombs dropped on it andandandand at
least a dozen exploded or unexploded bombs on its premises … Under the
pressure of bombing andandandand taking in many casualties the small
staff left at Guy’s itself knew each other pretty well … I used to
firewatch on the roof at Guy’s … We spent a lot of time gossiping
andandandand drinking tea … We used to camp out in the basement of
Nuffield House.11 Ryle was a wise andandandand intelligent man, whose
serenity, which had been tempered in the trenches during WW1, was a
great support to those like myself who disliked being bombed.</p>
<p>In April Wittgenstein underwent an operation at Guy’s to remove the
gall-stone that had been troubling him for a number of years. His
mistrust of English doctors (he was inclined to believe that both
Ramsey’s death and Skinner’s might have been avoided if they had
received proper medical care) impelled him to insist on remaining
conscious during the operation. Refusing a general anaesthetic, he had
mirrors placed in the operating theatre so that he could watch what was
happening. To help him through what was undoubtedly a painful ordeal,
John Ryle sat with him throughout the operation, holding his hand.</p>
<p>Apart from Ryle, Wittgenstein’s few friends at Guy’s tended to be
technicians rather than doctors. One of these was Naomi Wilkinson, a
radiographer and a cousin of Ryle’s. Miss Wilkinson used to organize
gramophone recitals at the hospital, at which Wittgenstein was a regular
attender. He took an intense interest in the choice of records, and was
often very critical of the selection. As a result of this common
interest in music, he and Miss Wilkinson became friends, and, as with
many of his friends, she was invited to join him for tea at Lyons. At
one of these teas she asked him how many people he thought understood
his philosophy. He pondered the question for a long time before he
replied: ’Two – and one of them is Gilbert Ryle.’12 He did not,
unfortunately, say who the second one was. And perhaps his choice of
Gilbert Ryle indicates nothing more than that, even in his fifties, he
had not entirely lost his childhood good manners – his inclination to
say things he thought would please the other person.</p>
<p>Naomi Wilkinson’s gramophone recitals perhaps provided one of the
elements in a dream that Wittgenstein recorded while he was working at
Guy’s:</p>
<p>Tonight I dreamt: my sister Gretl gave Louise Politzer a present: a
bag.13 I saw the bag in the dream, or rather just its steel lock, which
was very big and square and very finely constructed. It looked like one
of those complicated old padlocks one sometimes sees in museums. In this
lock there was, among other things, a mechanism by which the words ‘From
your Gretl’, or something similar, were spoken through the key-hole. I
thought about how intricate the mechanism of this device must be and
whether it was a kind of gramophone and of what sort of material the
records could be made, whether they were possibly made of steel.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein himself offers no interpretation of this dream, but
given his preoccupation at this time with Freud’s work, his previous use
of the metaphor of a lock to describe Freud’s central idea, and the fact
that Gretl was the member of his family most closely associated with
Freud, it is possible, I think, to regard this dream as being about the
interpretation of dreams. Dreams seem to say something, and a skilful
use of Freud’s work will enable us to hear what they say (through, as it
were, the key-hole of Freud’s theories), but the mechanism that lies
behind their saying something and the material from which dream symbols
are constructed (the unconscious) is intricate and complicated, too
complicated to be understood in terms of Freud’s rather crude analogy
with nineteenth-century mechanics.</p>
<p>Such, anyway, were the central themes of the discussions Wittgenstein
had with Rhees in the summer of 1942. He went to Swansea to stay with
Rhees, partly in order to recuperate from his gall-stone operation, and
the two of them would take walks along the South Wales coastline, of
which Wittgenstein was extremely fond. Rhees was at that time one of the
very few people left alive whom Wittgenstein valued as a partner in
philosophical discussion, but it is striking that, at a time when his
philosophical work centred mainly on the philosophy of mathematics, his
conversations with Rhees dealt with the nature of Freud’s explanations
in psychology.</p>
<p>There is a sense, he stressed, in which the images in a dream might
be regarded as symbols, a sense in which we can speak of a dream
language, even if the symbols are not understood by the dreamer. This
can emerge when we discuss the dream with an interpreter and accept his
interpretation. Similarly, when we draw apparently meaningless doodles
and an analyst asks us questions and traces associations, we might come
to an explanation of why we drew what we did: ‘we may then refer to the
doodling as a kind of writing, as using a kind of language, although it
was not understood by anyone’.14 But it was important to Wittgenstein to
dissociate this kind of explanation from those given in science.
Explanations of dreams or doodles do not proceed by the application of
laws, ‘and to me the fact that there aren’t actually any such laws seems
important’.15 Freud’s explanations have more in common with a mythology
than with science; for example, Freud produces no evidence for his view
that anxiety is always a repetition of the anxiety we felt at birth, and
yet ‘it is an idea which has a marked attraction’:16</p>
<p>It has the attraction which mythological explanations have,
explanations which say that this is all a repetition of something that
has happened before. And when people do accept or adopt this, then
certain things seem clearer and easier for them.</p>
<p>Freud’s explanations, then, are akin to the elucidations offered by
Wittgenstein’s own work. They provide, not a causal, mechanical theory,
but:</p>
<p>… something which people are inclined to accept and which makes it
easier for them to go certain ways: it makes certain ways of behaving
and thinking natural for them.17 They have given up one way of thinking
and adopted another.</p>
<p>It was in this respect that Wittgenstein described himself to Rhees
at this time as a ‘disciple’ or ‘follower’ of Freud.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s philosophical preoccupations throughout most of the
Second World War centred on the philosophy of mathematics. Most of what
he wrote at this time is an attempt to improve on the remarks written
during his last months in Norway, and thus improve the section of the
Investigations that was based on them. During the time he worked at
Guy’s he filled three notebooks with remarks on mathematics. They, and
the manuscript volume compiled from them, have now been published and
form Parts IV, V, VI and VII of Remarks on the Foundations of
Mathematics.</p>
<p>Though in its general outlines it is of a piece with his earlier work
on the subject, the assault on mathematical logic is expressed in more
caustic terms. It is, perhaps, his most polemical work.</p>
<p>In his essay ‘Mathematics and the Metaphysicians’, Russell provides
the most perfect summary of the target of Wittgenstein’s polemic. ‘One
of the chief triumphs of modern mathematics’, Russell writes, ‘consists
in having discovered what mathematics really is’:18</p>
<p>All pure mathematics – Arithmetic, Analysis, and Geometry – is built
up by combinations of the primitive ideas of logic, and its propositions
are deduced from the general axioms of logic, such as the syllogism and
the other rules of inference … The subject of formal logic has thus
shown itself to be identical with mathematics.</p>
<p>He goes on to discuss the problems of the infinitesimal, the infinite
and continuity:</p>
<p>In our time, three men – Weierstrass, Dedekind, and Cantor – have not
merely advanced the three problems, but have completely solved them. The
solutions, for those acquainted with mathematics, are so clear as to
leave no longer the slightest doubt or difficulty. This achievement is
probably the greatest of which our age has to boast.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s work is an attack on both the conception of
mathematics that is outlined here, and also the attitude towards it that
is revealed. ‘Why do I want to take the trouble to work out what
mathematics is?’ he asks in one of the notebooks kept during his period
at Guy’s:19</p>
<p>Because we have a mathematics, and a special conception of it, as it
were an ideal of its position and function, – and this needs to be
clearly worked out.</p>
<p>It is my task, not to attack Russell’s logic from within, but from
without.</p>
<p>That is to say: not to attack it mathematically – otherwise I should
be doing mathematics – but its position, its office.</p>
<p>For Wittgenstein, formal logic had not shown itself to be identical
with mathematics; to say it had: ‘is almost as if one tried to say that
cabinet-making consisted in glueing’.20 Nor has mathematical logic
finally shown us what mathematics is. It has rather: ‘completely
deformed the thinking of mathematicians and of philosophers’.21 And the
work of Weierstrass, Dedekind and Cantor, far from being the greatest
achievement of our age, was, in relation to the rest of mathematics: ‘a
cancerous growth, seeming to have grown out of the normal body aimlessly
and senselessly’.</p>
<p>In order to show that logic and mathematics are different techniques,
and that the results in mathematical logic do not have the importance
attributed to them by Russell (in understanding the concepts of
infinity, continuity and the infinitesimal), Wittgenstein tries a number
of tacks, including, for example, trying to show that the notions of
infinity, continuity and the infinitesimal as actually used in
mathematics and everyday life have not been clarified by the definitions
of them given by Cantor, Dedekind and Weierstrass, but, rather,
distorted.</p>
<p>But the centre of his attack consists in trying to show that the
methods of proof that typify mathematics are disanalogous to those used
in logic. A proof in logic consists in a series of propositions intended
to establish the truth of a conclusion. What Wittgenstein wants to show
is that a proof in mathematics consists rather in a series of pictures
intended to establish the usefulness of a technique.</p>
<p>For example, he sees no reason why this picture:</p>
<p>should not be regarded as a proof of the Commutative Law for
multiplication – i.e.: (a x b) = (b x a). For someone might, by looking
at the picture first one way and then the other, see that (5 x 4) is
equal to (4 x 5) and then come to use the principle of commutation in
all other cases.</p>
<p>Here there is no question of propositions or conclusions, and
consequently the question of what the commutative law, if true, is true
about does not arise. And if this sort of picture, rather than the
axiomatic systems of logic, were regarded as paradigmatic, then there
would be no reason at all to think that mathematical logicians had, as
Russell would have it, ‘discovered what mathematics really is’. In their
work on the ‘foundations of mathematics’ they had simply drawn a
different sort of picture, and invented a different sort of
technique.</p>
<p>But the point of emphasizing the role of pictures in mathematics is
not simply to destroy a particular conception of the subject. It is also
to substitute for it a conception of mathematical reasoning which
stresses the role of ‘seeing connections’. In order to grasp the
principle of commutation from the picture above we need to see this:</p>
<p>as the same as this:</p>
<p>If we could not ‘see the connection’, the proof would not convince us
of anything. The understanding of the proof, then, is a good, if
rudimentary, example of the kind of understanding that forms the basis
of Wittgenstein’s Weltanschauung. Mathematical proofs, like his own
philosophical remarks, should be seen as ‘perspicuous representations’,
the point of which is to produce ‘just that understanding which consists
in seeing connections’.</p>
<p>In this way, curious though it sounds, proofs in pure mathematics are
analogous to the explanations offered in Freudian psychoanalysis. And
perhaps the clue to Wittgenstein’s shift in concerns, from mathematics
to psychology, lies in his finding Freud’s ‘patterns’ more interesting
than the ‘pictures’ of mathematicians.</p>
<p>It would, one suspects, have been something of relief for
Wittgenstein to have been able to place the events of his own life into
some kind of pattern.</p>
<p>‘I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life’, he wrote on 1
April 1942:22</p>
<p>It is as though I had before me nothing more than a long stretch of
living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly
one. Friendless and joyless.</p>
<p>A few days later:</p>
<p>I suffer greatly from the fear of the complete isolation that
threatens me now.23 I cannot see how I can bear this life. I see it as a
life in which every day I have to fear the evening that brings me only
dull sadness.</p>
<p>At Guy’s he felt that he had to keep himself busy. ‘If you can’t find
happiness in stillness’, he told himself, ’find it in running!’24</p>
<p>But what if I am too tired to run? ‘Don’t talk of a collapse until
you break down.’</p>
<p>Like a cyclist I have to keep pedalling, to keep moving, in order not
to fall down.</p>
<p>‘My unhappiness is so complex’, he wrote in May, ‘that it is
difficult to describe.25 But probably the main thing is still
loneliness.’</p>
<p>After Skinner’s death Kirk had returned to Bournemouth, and, as he
had with Skinner, Wittgenstein began to fret about not receiving letters
from him. On 27 May he noted:</p>
<p>For ten days I’ve heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed
him a week ago for news.26 I think that he has perhaps broken with me. A
tragic thought!</p>
<p>In fact, Kirk married in Bournemouth, made a successful career for
himself in mechanical engineering and never saw Wittgenstein again. But
for Kirk there had been nothing to ‘break’ from. It had never occurred
to him that Wittgenstein might be, in any sense, homosexual, or that
their relationship was anything other than that between a teacher and a
pupil.</p>
<p>As if acknowledging this, Wittgenstein wrote, in the same diary
entry: ‘I have suffered much, but I am apparently incapable of learning
from my life.27 I suffer still just as I did many years ago. I have not
become any stronger or wiser.’</p>
<p>Some comfort – some relief from this desperate loneliness – came from
a friendship with a young colleague of his in the dispensary at Guy’s,
Roy Fouracre. It was, one gathers, principally Fouracre’s warmth and
jovial good humour that endeared him to Wittgenstein. Sometimes,
Wittgenstein told Drury, he would be rushed or agitated and Roy would
say to him, ‘Steady, Prof.’ This he liked.</p>
<p>Fouracre would visit Wittgenstein in his room on the third floor of
Nuffield House. The room, like his rooms at Cambridge, was completely
bare, and Fouracre was surprised to see no philosophy books at all, but
only neat piles of detective magazines. Fouracre was at the time
studying for a correspondence course in modern languages, and would
often sit in Wittgenstein’s room reading while Wittgenstein sat quite
still and silent. During these times Wittgenstein would be preparing for
the lectures that he gave in Cambridge every alternate weekend. On the
other weekends Wittgenstein and Fouracre would go on outings, perhaps to
the zoo or to Victoria Park in Hackney, where they would go rowing on
the lake.</p>
<p>Like many who knew Wittgenstein well, Fouracre remembers his virtuoso
whistling. He recalls Wittgenstein’s ability to whistle whole movements
of symphonies, his showpiece being Brahms’s St Anthony Variations, and
that when other people whistled something wrong, Wittgenstein would stop
them and firmly tell them how it should go – something that didn’t
endear him to his fellow workers in the dispensary.</p>
<p>Fouracre’s background could hardly have been more different to that
of Skinner. Whereas Skinner had been brought up in a middle-class home
in Letchworth and had been educated at public school and Cambridge,
Fouracre lived in a council house in Hackney, East London, and had
started work at the age of fifteen. But their personal qualities were,
in many ways, similar. Fania Pascal’s description of Skinner:</p>
<p>He could be cheerful and liked the company of others.28 Without guile
of any kind, he was incapable of thinking evil of anyone. He could and
did learn to be more practical, though alas, he would always be too
unselfish, too self-effacing.</p>
<p>could serve equally as a description of Fouracre. Like Skinner,
Fouracre was considerably younger than Wittgenstein – in his early
twenties to Wittgenstein’s fifty-two. And while it would be wrong to
imply that Wittgenstein’s friendship with Fouracre provided anything
like a substitute for his love for Skinner, it is true that for the
eighteen months they worked together Fouracre filled a role in
Wittgenstein’s life similar to that which Skinner had filled at
Cambridge. That is, he provided Wittgenstein with some sort of human
contact: he was, like Francis, someone whose mere presence had a
reassuring effect.</p>
<p>In many of his later letters to Fouracre, Wittgenstein mentions Guy’s
with warmth and with some element, perhaps, of nostalgia:</p>
<p>I’m sorry to hear the atmosphere at Guy’s is getting worse.29 It’s
difficult to imagine. [8.6.49]</p>
<p>I wonder what the job news are you write about.30 I suppose it isn’t
that they are errecting a huge statue of me in front of Nuffield House.
Or is it? Of course, no monument of stone could really show what a
wonderful person I am. [15.12.50]</p>
<p>Fouracre obviously replied to the last suggestion telling
Wittgenstein that all the statues to him at Guy’s had been pulled down.
‘I’m glad to hear [it]’, Wittgenstein wrote in his next letter, ’as long
as it wasn’t done in any disrespectful way!’31</p>
<p>Of the medical staff at Guy’s, the only person to have gained
Wittgenstein’s trust and friendship, apart from John Ryle, seems to have
been Basil Reeve, a young doctor (then in his early thirties) with an
interest in philosophy. When he heard from Reg Waterfield that the new
member at the dining table (whom he had previously thought ‘looked
interesting and rather lost amongst the hospital physicians’) was Ludwig
Wittgenstein, he decided to try to make his acquaintance. He therefore
started sitting next to Wittgenstein at dinner, and eventually a
friendship developed between the two. The topic of conversation,
however, hardly ever turned to philosophy, but would centre instead on
art or architecture or music, or people Wittgenstein had known, or even
Freudian interpretations of some of the medical conversation that went
on at the dinner table. Later, it became centred on Reeve’s own work, in
which Wittgenstein began to take a keen interest.</p>
<p>Reeve was at Guy’s working in the Medical Research Council’s Clinical
Research Unit with a colleague, Dr Grant. Early in the Blitz the
laboratories of this unit were destroyed by bombing, and, unable to
pursue their original studies, Grant and Reeve started studying the
plentiful air-raid casualties that were being admitted to Guy’s at this
time. Their object was to try and familiarize themselves with the
condition of ‘wound shock’, which would occur not only in battle
casualties but in any condition of acute traumatic injury.</p>
<p>Grant and Reeve’s initial problem was that, in spite of a detailed
study of the scientific literature, there seemed to be no satisfactory
way of defining clinically the condition of ‘wound shock’. Some authors
identified the condition on the basis of the presence of
haemoconcentration (the development of an abnormally high concentration
of red cells in the blood thought to be due to the leakage of plasma
from the blood into the tissues), while others recognized it as a
syndrome of low blood pressure, skin pallor and rapid pulse. Quite early
on in the research, therefore, Grant recommended that the very concept
of ‘wound shock’ should be abandoned and that detailed observations of
casualties should be made without using the term. In January 1941 – ten
months before Wittgenstein came to Guy’s – Grant produced a memorandum
on the observations required in cases of wound shock, outlining his
objections to the concept:</p>
<p>Recent experience of air raid casualties shows that in spite of all
the work already done, specially in the last war, but little is known
about the nature and treatment of traumatic or wound shock.32 In the
first place there is in practice a wide variation in the application of
the diagnosis of ‘shock’. We cannot yet foretell and we are often in
doubt about treatment. Moreover, the lack of a common basis of diagnosis
renders it impossible to assess the efficacy of the various methods of
treatment adopted.</p>
<p>There is good ground, therefore, for the view that it would be better
to avoid the diagnosis of ‘shock’ and to replace it by an accurate and
complete record of a patient’s state and progress together with the
treatment given.</p>
<p>It is clear, I think, why Wittgenstein should find this radical
approach to the problem interesting and important. Grant’s way of
dealing with the problem of ‘shock’ has an obvious parallel with
Heinrich Hertz’s way of dealing with the problems of ‘force’ in physics.
In The Principles of Mechanics Hertz had proposed that, instead of
giving a direct answer to the question: ‘What is force?’ the problem
should be dealt with by restating Newtonian physics without using
‘force’ as a basic concept. Throughout his life, Wittgenstein regarded
Hertz’s solution to the problem as a perfect model of how philosophical
confusion should be dispelled, and frequently cited – as a statement of
his own aim in philosophy – the following sentence from Hertz’s
introduction to The Principles of Mechanics:</p>
<p>When these painful contradictions are removed, the question as to the
nature of force will not have been answered; but our minds, no longer
vexed, will cease to ask illegitimate questions.</p>
<p>In a conscious echo of this sentence, Wittgenstein wrote:</p>
<p>In my way of doing philosophy, its whole aim is to give an expression
such a form that certain disquietudes disappear.33 (Hertz).</p>
<p>And we might say of Grant’s proposal to avoid the diagnosis of
‘shock’ that its whole aim was to: ‘give an expression such a form that
certain disquietudes disappear’.</p>
<p>Grant’s approach was not, however, universally well received –
especially by the army. Colonel Whitby of the Army Blood Transfusion
Service responded to Grant’s report in the following letter to the
Medical Research Council:</p>
<p>Quite a lot of the preamble, and some of the discussion was devoted
to a diatribe against the word ‘Shock’.34 I do not feel that this point
needs to be so heavily emphasised.</p>
<p>It is not justifiable to throw over the findings of the last war.
These men were not fools … they at least established the fundamental
fact that lowered blood pressure was a sign very constantly observed.
Grant would throw over the whole of the valuable MRC literature of the
last war because their records do not attain his standard of detail.</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein realized when he discussed the project with Reeve,
the problem with the theories of wound shock formulated during the First
World War was not primarily that their standard of detail was
inadequate, but that they were operating with an unusable concept. It
was precisely the ‘diatribe against the word “Shock”’ that most
interested him. (Reeve remembers that when they came to write an annual
report, Wittgenstein suggested printing the word ‘shock’ upside-down to
emphasize its unusability.)</p>
<p>Because of the interest he showed in the project, Wittgenstein was
introduced by Reeve to Dr Grant, who was immediately impressed by the
acuteness and relevance of the many questions and suggestions he made
concerning the investigations. During 1942, the heavy bombing of London,
which had provided Grant’s team with a steady supply of research
material, began to peter out. The unit therefore began to search
elsewhere for casualties suitable for their observations. On two
occasions, stations of Bomber Command were visited and a number of
instances of injury to air-crew, incurred in bombing raids, were
observed. But to make progress in the research a more constant supply of
injured people was needed, so arrangements were made for the unit to
move to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle, which admitted a large
number of heavy industrial and road injuries to its wards. At the time
this move was planned Wittgenstein told Reeve he would like to go with
the Unit to Newcastle.</p>
<p>The Unit moved to Newcastle in November 1942. Grant’s technician,
however, refused to go, and remembering Wittgenstein’s interest in the
project, Grant offered him the post. By the spring of 1943, Fouracre had
left Guy’s to join the army, and there was, presumably, little else to
keep Wittgenstein there. In April 1943 Grant wrote to Dr Herrald at the
Medical Research Council office in London saying:</p>
<p>Professor Ludwig Wittgenstein, of whom I told you, joined the unit as
Laboratory Assistant on the 29th April for a probationary period of one
month.35 As I arranged with you, he will be paid at the rate of £4 a
week.</p>
<p>As he was earning only twenty-eight shillings a week as a dispensary
porter, this would have constituted a significant increase in income.
When the probationary period of a month was up Grant wrote again to
Herrald confirming the arrangement, adding: ’He is proving very
useful.’36</p>
<p>The change from a manual job to the more cerebral task of assisting
the research unit was no doubt welcome to Wittgenstein, and not only
because he was finding the physical demands of the work as a porter a
little difficult. Just before he left Guy’s, on 17 March, he wrote to
Hutt about the value of thinking. ‘I imagine’, he wrote, ‘that thinking
a little more than you probably do would do you good.37 – I hope your
family isn’t keeping you from thinking!? If anyone does they act very
foolishly.’ Hutt had, by now, left Woolworth’s and was to join the army.
He had written to Wittgenstein about some trouble he had with his
superiors. ‘I imagine’, Wittgenstein replied, ‘that it’s partly external
andandandand partly internal’:</p>
<p>I mean, they mayn’t be as decent with you as you deserve, – but you
tend to be unreliable. I.e. you tend to be alternatively cold, warm,
andandandand lukewarm; andandandand you mustn’t be surprised if people
sometimes disregard your periods of warmth andandandand treat you as if
you could be cold andandandand lukewarm only.</p>
<p>Before he left for Newcastle, Wittgenstein spent some time in Swansea
with Rush Rhees. There he resumed the conversations he had the previous
summer about Freud. Again, it was the idea that dream symbols form a
kind of language that interested him – the fact that we naturally think
that dreams mean something, even if we do not know what they mean.
Analogously, he told Rhees of the five spires of Moscow Cathedral: ‘On
each of these there is a different sort of curving configuration. One
gets the strong impression that these different shapes and arrangements
must mean something.’38 The question at issue was the extent to which
Freud’s work is useful in enabling us to interpret dreams. He stressed
that what was wanted was not an explanation but an interpretation. Thus
a scientific theory of dreams – which might, for example, enable us to
predict that a dreamer could be brought to recall certain memories after
providing us with a description of a dream – would not even touch the
problem. Freud’s work is interesting precisely because it does not
provide such a scientific treatment. What puzzles us about a dream is
not its causality but its significance. We want the kind of explanation
which ‘changes the aspect’ under which we see the images of a dream, so
that they now make sense. Freud’s idea that dreams are wish fulfilments
is important because it ‘points to the sort of interpretation that is
wanted’, but it is too general.39 Some dreams obviously are wish
fulfilments – ‘the sexual dreams of adults, for instance’. But it is
strange that these are precisely the kind of dreams ignored by
Freud:</p>
<p>Freud very commonly gives what we might call a sexual
interpretation.40 But it is interesting that among all the reports of
dreams which he gives, there is not a single example of a
straightforward sexual dream. Yet these are as common as rain.</p>
<p>This again is connected with Freud’s determination to provide a
single pattern for all dreams: all dreams must be, for him, expressions
of longing, rather than, for example, expressions of fear. Freud, like
philosophical theorists, had been seduced by the method of science and
the ‘craving for generality’. There is not one type of dream, and
neither is there one way to interpret the symbols in a dream. Dream
symbols do mean something – ‘Obviously there are certain similarities
with language’ – but to understand them requires not some general theory
of dreams, but the kind of multi-faceted skill that is involved, say, in
the understanding of a piece of music.41</p>
<p>In April Wittgenstein left Swansea to join Grant’s research unit in
Newcastle. The members of the unit, Basil Reeve, Dr Grant and Miss Helen
Andrews, Grant’s secretary, all lodged in the same house in Brandling
Park, an area within walking distance of the hospital. The house
belonged to a Mrs Moffat. Miss Andrews remembers the arrival of
Wittgenstein:</p>
<p>There was a vacant room at Mrs Moffat’s so he joined us there.42 By
this time we had settled in andandandand adapted to our unusual
surroundings, but Prof. W. did not easily fit in. He came down to
breakfast in a bright andandandand chatty mood, while we all shared a
Manchester Guardian andandandand did not talk much. In the evening when
we relaxed, he would not join us at dinner, but preferred to eat in his
bedroom. Mrs Moffat, grumbling, put his meal on a tray andandandand he
came downstairs andandandand fetched it. (I thought this was rude to Dr
Grant.)</p>
<p>We had a sitting room with a good coal fire andandandand he never
spent an evening there with us. He went to a cinema almost every
evening, but could not remember anything about the films when asked
about them the following day. He just went to relax.</p>
<p>Not long after Wittgenstein’s arrival, the members of the unit had to
leave the house in Brandling Park, because of Mrs Moffat’s ill health.
They each found separate digs, but, recalls Miss Andrews, ‘Prof. W. had
difficulty in finding anywhere to live because as he had a foreign
accent, looked a bit shabby andandandand said he was a professor, most
landladies were quite naturally suspicious.’</p>
<p>That Wittgenstein went every evening to see a film is an indication
of how hard he worked at Newcastle, and how seriously he took the work.
It is reminiscent of his remark to Drury:</p>
<p>You think philosophy is difficult enough but I can tell you it is
nothing to the difficulty of being a good architect.43 When I was
building the house for my sister in Vienna I was so completely exhausted
at the end of the day that all I could do was go to a ‘flick’ every
night.</p>
<p>Another indication of this is that while at Newcastle he wrote no
philosophy at all, whereas while he was at Guy’s he filled three
notebooks with remarks on the philosophy of mathematics. He did not
confine himself to fulfilling his duties as a technician, but took an
intense and active interest in the thinking behind the research.
Although both Grant and Reeve benefited from discussing their ideas with
Wittgenstein, and encouraged his interest in their work, they sometimes
found his absorption in the research a little too intense. Miss Andrews
remembers that, because the unit worked so hard, Grant would sometimes
suggest that they all take a day off and go for a walk together along
Hadrian’s Wall. She noticed that Wittgenstein was never invited to
accompany them on these communal walks, and asked Grant why he was left
out. She was told that if he came with them it would defeat the purpose
of the walk, because he: ‘talked shop all the time’.</p>
<p>Although he was not invited on these ‘rest-day’ walks, both Grant and
Reeve remember accompanying Wittgenstein on many other occasions on
walks along the Roman wall. Usually the conversation centred on their
research, but with Reeve in particular Wittgenstein would often discuss
more personal matters. He talked to Reeve, for example, about his early
childhood, mentioning that he did not talk until he was four years old.
He told Reeve a childhood memory that he had also related to Drury, and
which obviously had a great significance for him. In the lavatory of his
home, he said, some plaster had fallen from the wall, and he always saw
this pattern as a duck, but it frightened him: it had the appearance for
him of those monsters that Bosch painted in his Temptations of St
Anthony.</p>
<p>Reeve would at times ask Wittgenstein about philosophy, but
Wittgenstein characteristically discouraged his interest in the subject.
He emphasized to Reeve that, unlike his own subject of medicine,
philosophy was absolutely useless, and that unless you were compelled to
do it, there was no point in pursuing it. ‘You do decent work in
medicine’, he told Reeve; ‘be content with that.’44 ‘In any case’, he
would add mischievously, ‘you’re too stupid.’ It is interesting,
however, that forty years later Reeve should say that he had been
influenced in his thinking by Wittgenstein in two important ways: first,
to keep in mind that things are as they are; and secondly, to seek
illuminating comparisons to get an understanding of how they are.</p>
<p>Both these ideas are central to Wittgenstein’s later philosophy.
Wittgenstein, indeed, thought of using Bishop Butler’s phrase:
‘Everything is what it is, and not another thing’ as a motto for
Philosophical Investigations. And the importance of illuminating
comparisons not only lies at the heart of Wittgenstein’s central notion
of: ‘the understanding which consists in seeing connections’, but was
also regarded by Wittgenstein as characterizing his whole contribution
to philosophy. Wittgenstein’s conversations with Reeve, like his work in
helping Grant and Reeve to clarify their ideas about ‘shock’, show that
there are more ways of having a philosophical influence than by
discussing philosophy. Wittgenstein imparted a way of thinking and
understanding, not by saying what was distinctive about it, but by
showing how it can be used to clarify one’s ideas.</p>
<p>Both Grant and Reeve recall that Wittgenstein’s influence played an
important part in the thinking embodied in the introduction to the final
report of the unit, which, significantly, did not use the word ‘shock’
in its main title, but was called, rather, Observations on the General
Effects of Injury in Man. The main thread of argument is the same as
that in Grant’s original memorandum of January 1941, but the ‘diatribe
against the word “Shock”’ is expressed in even stronger terms:</p>
<p>In practice we found that the diagnosis of shock seemed to depend on
the personal views of the individual making it rather than on generally
accepted criteria.45 Unless we were acquainted with these views we did
not know what to expect when called to the bedside. The label alone did
not indicate what signs and symptoms the patient displayed, how ill he
was or what treatment he required. The only common ground for diagnosis
that we could detect was that the patient seemed ill. We were led,
therefore, to discard the word ‘shock’ in its varying definitions. We
have not since found it to be of any value in the study of injury; it
has rather been a hindrance to unbiased observation and a cause of
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Whether this was written by Wittgenstein or not, it had an effect
that he hoped his philosophical work would have – namely, it put an end
to many misguided lines of research. The Report of the Medical Research
Council for 1939–45 says of the work done under Grant:</p>
<p>[It] threw grave doubt upon the value of attacking the ‘shock’
problem as if wound ‘shock’ were a single clinical and pathological
entity.46 In consequence, several lines of investigation started for the
Committee at the beginning of the war were abandoned.</p>
<p>It had the effect, in fact, that Wittgenstein had hoped for in his
later work on the philosophy of mathematics – the effect that sunlight
has on the growth of potato shoots.</p>
<p>The purpose of the research conducted by Grant and Reeve was not
primarily to campaign against the use of the word ‘shock’ in diagnosing
the effects of injury, but to uncover other, more fruitful, diagnoses
and treatments than those derived from the research done in the First
World War. For this they needed detailed observations of the effects of
injuries. Wittgenstein’s part in this practical aspect of the work was
to cut frozen sections of tissue and stain them in order to detect the
presence of, for example, fat. He apparently did this very well.</p>
<p>As well as this histological work, Wittgenstein was asked by Grant to
assist in his investigations into Pulsus Paradoxus, a pulse pressure
that varies with respiration, which often occurred in badly injured
patients. In this he seems to have introduced a technological innovation
by inventing a better apparatus for recording pulse pressure than the
one they had. Both Grant and Reeve remember that this apparatus was
innovatory, but neither could remember the details of it. The only
description we have of this apparatus, therefore, is the one Drury gives
when he describes the time he used his leave from the army to visit
Wittgenstein in Newcastle:</p>
<p>After the end of the campaign in North Africa I was posted back to
England to prepare for the Normandy landing.47 Having a period of
disembarkation leave, I travelled up to Newcastle to spend a few days
with Wittgenstein … He took me to his room in the Research Department
and showed me the apparatus which he himself had designed for his
investigation. Dr Grant had asked him to investigate the relationship
between breathing (depth and rate) and pulse (volume and rate).
Wittgenstein had so arranged things that he could act as his own subject
and obtain the necessary tracings on a revolving drum. He had made
several improvements in the original apparatus, so much so that Dr Grant
had said he wished Wittgenstein had been a physiologist and not a
philosopher. In describing to me his results so far he made a
characteristic remark: ‘It is all very much more complicated than you
would imagine at first sight.’</p>
<p>Drury’s visit to Newcastle also provides us with a revealing
conversation, showing an interesting change in Wittgenstein’s attitude
to sex. By 1943, it seems, far from accepting Weininger’s view that sex
and spirituality were incompatible, Wittgenstein was sympathetic to a
view of the sexual act which saw it as an object of religious reverence.
Drury relates that while he was staying in Newcastle with Wittgenstein,
the two of them caught a train to Durham and took a walk by the river
there. As they walked Drury talked to Wittgenstein about his experiences
in Egypt, and especially about seeing the temples at Luxor. He told
Wittgenstein that, although seeing the temples was a wonderful
experience, he had been surprised and shocked to find on the wall of one
of the temples a bas-relief of the god Horus, with an erect phallus, in
the act of ejaculation and collecting the semen in a bowl. Wittgenstein
responded to this story with an encouraging rejection of Drury’s implied
disapproval:</p>
<p>Why in the world shouldn’t they have regarded with awe and reverence
that act by which the human race is perpetuated? Not every religion has
to have St Augustine’s attitude to sex.48</p>
<p>When Wittgenstein had first moved to Newcastle, he had responded with
an even more dismissive frankness to another remark of Drury’s. Drury
had written to him wishing him luck in his new work, and added that he
hoped Wittgenstein would make lots of friends. Wittgenstein replied:</p>
<p>It is obvious to me that you are becoming thoughtless and stupid.49
How could you imagine I would ever have ‘lots of friends’?</p>
<p>Though harshly expressed, this was doubtless true. Wittgenstein’s
only friend at Newcastle seems to have been Basil Reeve. He got on well
with Grant, and they shared an interest in music (Grant can remember
Wittgenstein’s enthusiastic agreement when he once mentioned that he
disliked the opening of Beethoven’s ‘Emperor’ Concerto), but there was
little of the warmth of feeling – the simple human contact – that
Wittgenstein had shared at Guy’s with Roy Fouracre. Grant was too
absorbed in his own work for that. Wittgenstein had complained to
Fouracre about the lack of human contact his philosophical work at
Cambridge provided, but at Newcastle, as his letters to Norman Malcolm
show, he began to miss his Cambridge friends:</p>
<p>I haven’t heard from Smythies for many months.50 I know he is in
Oxford but he doesn’t write to me. – [Casimir] Lewy is still at
Cambridge … Rhees is still lecturing at Swansea … I hope you’ll see
Moore andandandand find him in good health. [11.9.43]</p>
<p>I am feeling rather lonely here andandandand may try to get to some
place where I have someone to talk to. E.g. to Swansea where Rhees is a
lecturer in philosophy.51 [7.12.43]</p>
<p>More important, perhaps, he began to miss the opportunity to pursue
his own work. Absorption in Grant and Reeve’s work was no longer
enough:</p>
<p>I too regret that for external andandandand internal reasons I can’t
do philosophy, for that’s the only work that’s given me real
satisfaction.52 No other work really bucks me up. I’m extremely busy now
andandandand my mind is kept occupied the whole time but at the end of
the day I just feel tired andandandand sad.</p>
<p>The ‘internal reasons’ were Wittgenstein’s doubts about whether he
was still capable of good work in philosophy. He used to say to Reeve,
time and again: ‘my brain has gone’, and would often talk about his days
in Norway in 1913 with a wistful longing: ‘Then my mind was on fire …
but now it’s gone.’ The ‘external reasons’ were the demands of the job
that he was doing in Newcastle, and rather unsatisfactory lodgings. He
was also finding continued exposure to hospital registrars and house
officers, with their outspoken and often ribald comments about their
patients, more and more difficult to accept, and he required more and
more help from Reeve in understanding the responses of young doctors to
the stresses of their profession.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a consequence of these frustrations, together with the
extra limitations on Reeve’s time caused by the arrival in Newcastle of
his wife and young baby, even Wittgenstein’s relationship with Reeve
began to deteriorate. Wittgenstein – ever a possessive friend – began to
demand more of Reeve’s time and attention while the demands of Reeve’s
work and home life limited the amount he could give. They eventually
parted on bad terms. Wittgenstein’s words of goodbye to Reeve were:
‘You’re not such a nice person as I had thought.’ For his part, Reeve
felt relieved that he would not have to go on giving Wittgenstein the
emotional support he demanded.</p>
<p>Given Wittgenstein’s frustrated yearning to return to philosophical
work, and his worsening relationship with Reeve, it was probably a
relief for him to hear that Grant and Reeve were leaving Newcastle.
Their research had begun to emphasize the need for further study of the
effects of blood loss and tissue damage, and this necessitated access to
injuries of a more severe degree than were available in civil life. They
therefore needed to conduct their research on the battlefield, and so,
towards the end of 1943, arrangements were made to transfer them to
Italy.</p>
<p>Grant’s successor was Dr E. G. Bywaters, who, like Grant and Reeve,
had previously carried out observations on air-raid casualties in
London. Before he left, Grant wrote to Dr A. Landsborough Thomson at the
Medical Research Council Head Office in London, telling him:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein has agreed to continue as laboratory assistant in the
meantime, but the duration of his stay will depend on how he gets on
with Bywaters.53</p>
<p>He urged him to keep Wittgenstein on as an employee of the Council,
even if he decided to leave Newcastle:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein has taken up laboratory work as a contribution to the
war effort, as I told you he is Professor of Philosophy at Cambridge. If
he decides that he cannot continue here after Reeve and I go, it seems a
pity not to use him further … He has a first class brain and a
surprising knowledge of physiology. He is an excellent man to discuss
problems with. On the practical side, he has served us well as a
laboratory assistant and in addition has by himself made new
observations on man on the respiratory variations of blood pressure
devising his own apparatus and experiments. He is not an easy man to
deal with, but given suitable conditions, can be a helpful and
stimulating colleague. I presume that after the war, he will return to
his Chair at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Grant and Reeve finally left for Italy at the end of January 1944.
Wittgenstein was, as we have seen, feeling lonely and depressed before
Bywaters arrived, and although he continued to fulfil his duties as a
technician with care and attention, he did not care to socialize.
Bywaters remembers:</p>
<p>He was reserved andandandand rather withdrawn: when in conversation
at coffee or teatime, philosophical subjects came up, he refused to be
drawn.54 I was disappointed in this, but pleased with his meticulous
andandandand conscientious approach to the frozen sections of lung
andandandand other organs that he prepared for me. I remember him as an
enigmatic, non-communicating, perhaps rather depressed person who
preferred the deck chair in his room to any social encounters.</p>
<p>Bywaters had been there only three weeks when he had to write to his
head office asking for help in finding a new technician:</p>
<p>Professor Wittgenstein has been doing the histological work here for
Dr Grant … He has now received a letter from Cambridge requesting him to
spend the next three months or longer writing a treatise on his own
subject (philosophy).55</p>
<p>A week later, on 16 February, he wrote:</p>
<p>Professor Wittgenstein left us today: he has been called back to his
Cambridge Chair to write a treatise on Philosophy, which has been in the
air for the last year or so, but they now want it on paper.56</p>
<p>So, on 16 February 1944, Wittgenstein left Newcastle and returned to
Cambridge. The reference in Bywaters’s letter to a treatise which has
‘been in the air for the last year or so’ but which ‘they now want on
paper’ makes it plausible to assume that ‘they’ refers not to Cambridge
University, but to Cambridge University Press.</p>
<p>In September 1943 Wittgenstein had approached the Press with a
suggestion that they publish his new book, Philosophical Investigations,
alongside his old book, the Tractatus. This idea had occurred to him
earlier in the year, when he and Nicholas Bachtin had been reading the
Tractatus together. He also mentioned the idea to Reeve, saying that he
liked the idea of publishing a refutation of ideas in the Tractatus
alongside the Tractatus. Cambridge University Press confirmed their
acceptance of this offer on 14 January 1944, which ties in with
Bywaters’s first letter saying: ‘He has now received a letter from
Cambridge …’ This plan, however, like the previous plan accepted by the
University Press in 1938, was never carried out.</p>
