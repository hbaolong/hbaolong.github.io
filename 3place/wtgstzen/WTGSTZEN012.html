<h4 id="an-entirely-rural-affair">9 ‘AN ENTIRELY RURAL AFFAIR’</h4>
<p>THOUGH NOT INSPIRED with the reforming zeal of the adherents to
Glöckel’s programme, Wittgenstein entered the teaching profession with a
still more idealistic set of intentions, and a rather romantic,
Tolstoyan conception of what it would be like to live and work among the
rural poor.</p>
<p>In keeping with his general ethical Weltanschauung, he sought, not to
improve their external conditions, but to better them ‘internally’. He
wanted to develop their intellects by teaching them mathematics, to
extend their cultural awareness by introducing them to the great
classics of the German language, and to improve their souls by reading
the Bible with them. It was not his aim to take them away from their
poverty; nor did he see education as a means to equip them for a
‘better’ life in the city. He wanted, rather, to impress upon them the
value of intellectual attainment for its own sake – just as, conversely,
he would later impress upon Cambridge undergraduates the inherent value
of manual work.</p>
<p>The ideal that emerges from his teaching, whether in the Austrian
countryside or at Cambridge University, is a Ruskinian one of honest
toil combined with a refined intelligence, a deep cultural appreciation
and a devout seriousness; a meagre income, but a rich inner life.</p>
<p>It was important to him to work in an area of rural poverty. However,
as was customary for graduates of the Lehrerbildungsanhalt, he was sent
to do his probationary teaching year at a school in Maria Schultz am
Semmering, a small, pleasant and relatively prosperous town, famous as a
pilgrim centre, in the countryside south of Vienna. After a brief
inspection of the place, he decided it would not do. He explained to the
astonished headmaster that he had noticed the town had a park with a
fountain: ’That is not for me, I want an entirely rural affair.’1 In
that case, the headmaster suggested, he should go to Trattenbach, a
village the other side of the neighbouring hills. Wittgenstein at once
set off on the ninety-minute hike and found, much to his delight,
exactly the sort of place he had in mind.</p>
<p>Trattenbach was small and poor. Those of its villagers who had jobs
were employed either at the local textile factory or on the neighbouring
farms. Life for these villagers was difficult, especially in the
deprived years of the 1920s. Wittgenstein was, however (initially, at
any rate), enchanted with the place. Soon after his arrival he wrote to
Russell, who was then in China at the start of his year’s visiting
lectureship at the University of Peking, giving his address proudly as
‘LW Schoolmaster Trattenbach’, and revelling in the obscurity of his new
position:</p>
<p>I am to be an elementary-school teacher in a tiny village called
Trattenbach.2 It’s in the mountains, about four hours’ journey south of
Vienna. It must be the first time that the schoolmaster at Trattenbach
has ever corresponded with a professor in Peking.</p>
<p>To Engelmann, a month later, he was even more enthusiastic. He
described Trattenbach as ‘a beautiful and tiny place’ and reported
himself to be ‘happy in my work at school’.3 But, he added darkly, ‘I do
need it badly, or else all the devils in hell break loose inside
me.’</p>
<p>His letters to Hänsel during these first few months are written in a
similarly cheerful spirit. He relied upon Hänsel to supply him with
reading books for his pupils, and would send him requests to order
multiple copies of, for example, Grimm’s stories, Gulliver’s Travels,
Lessing’s fables and Tolstoy’s legends. Hänsel visited him regularly at
the weekends, as did Arvid Sjögren, Moritz Nähe (the Wittgenstein family
photographer) and Michael Drobil. These visits tended, however, to
emphasize the already obvious differences between Wittgenstein and the
villagers, including his own colleagues, and it was not long before he
became the subject of rumour and speculation. One of his colleagues,
Georg Berger, once came across Wittgenstein and Hänsel sitting together
in the school office. Wittgenstein immediately demanded to know what was
being said about him in the village. Berger hesitated, but on being
pressed told Wittgenstein: ‘the villagers take you to be a rich
baron’.4</p>
<p>Berger omitted to use the word, but it was certainly as an eccentric
aristocrat that Wittgenstein was regarded. ‘Fremd’ (strange) was the
word most often used by the villagers to describe him. Why, they asked,
should a man of such wealth and culture choose to live among the poor,
especially when he showed such little sympathy for their way of life and
clearly preferred the company of his refined Viennese friends? Why
should he live such a meagre existence?</p>
<p>At first Wittgenstein had lodged in a small room in the local
guest-house, ‘Zum braunen Hirschen’, but he quickly found the noise of
the dance music coming from below too much for him, and left. He then
made a bed for himself in the school kitchen. There, according to Berger
(who was, one suspects, one of the chief sources of the stories told by
the villagers about Wittgenstein), he would sit for hours by the kitchen
window, watching the stars.</p>
<p>He soon established himself as an energetic, enthusiastic but rather
strict schoolmaster. In many ways, as his sister Hermine writes, he was
a born teacher:</p>
<p>He is interested in everything himself and he knows how to pick the
most important aspects of anything and make them clear to others.5 I
myself had the opportunity of watching Ludwig teach on a number of
occasions, as he devoted some afternoons to the boys in my occupational
school. It was a marvellous treat for all of us. He did not simply
lecture, but tried to lead the boys to the correct solution by means of
questions. On one occasion he had them inventing a steam engine, on
another designing a tower on the blackboard, and on yet another
depicting moving human figures. The interest which he aroused was
enormous. Even the ungifted and usually inattentive among the boys came
up with astonishingly good answers, and they were positively climbing
over each other in their eagerness to be given a chance to answer or to
demonstrate a point.</p>
<p>Despite his misgivings about the School Reform Movement, it was among
the reformers, such as Putre and Wilhelm Kundt, the District School
Superintendent, that Wittgenstein found most encouragement and support
during his career as a teacher. His teaching methods shared some of the
basic principles of the Reform Movement, the most important of which was
that a child should not be taught simply to repeat what it has been
told, but should instead be encouraged to think through problems for
itself. Thus practical exercises played a large part in his teaching.
The children were taught anatomy by assembling the skeleton of a cat,
astronomy by gazing at the sky at night, botany by identifying plants on
walks in the countryside, architecture by identifying building styles
during an excursion to Vienna. And so on. With everything he taught,
Wittgenstein attempted to arouse in the children the same curiosity and
questioning spirit that he himself brought to everything in which he
took an interest.</p>
<p>This naturally worked better with some children than with others.
Wittgenstein achieved especially good results with some of the boys that
he taught, and with a select group of his favourite pupils, mainly boys,
he gave extra tuition outside school hours. To these children, he became
a sort of father figure.</p>
<p>However, to those children who were not gifted, or whose interest
failed to be aroused by his enthusiasm, he became not a figure of
fatherly kindness, but a tyrant. The emphasis he placed on the teaching
of mathematics led him to devote the first two hours of each morning to
the subject. He believed that it was never too early to begin algebra,
and taught mathematics at a far higher level than was expected of his
age group. For some of his pupils, the girls especially, the first two
hours of the day were remembered with horror for years afterwards. One
of them, Anna Brenner, recalls:</p>
<p>During the arithmetic lesson we that had algebra had to sit in the
first row.6 My friend Anna Völkerer and I one day decided not to give
any answers. Wittgenstein asked: ‘What do you have?’ To the question
what is three times six Anna said: ‘I don’t know.’ He asked me how many
metres there were in a kilometre. I said nothing and received a box on
my ears. Later Wittgenstein said: ‘If you don’t know I’ll take a child
from the youngest class in the school who will know.’ After the lesson
Wittgenstein took me into the office and asked: ‘Is it that you don’t
want to [do arithmetic] or is it that you can’t?’ I said ‘Yes, I want
to.’ Wittgenstein said to me: ‘You are a good student, but as for
arithmetic … Or are you ill? Do you have a headache?’ Then I lied,
‘Yes!’ ‘Then’, said Wittgenstein, ‘please, please Brenner, can you
forgive me?’ While he said this he held up his hands in prayer. I
immediately felt my lie to be a great disgrace.</p>
<p>As this account illustrates, one respect in which Wittgenstein’s
methods differed sharply from those recommended by Glöckel’s reforms was
in his use of corporal punishment. Another girl who was weak at
mathematics remembers that one day Wittgenstein pulled her hair so hard
that when she later combed it a lot of it fell out. The reminiscences of
his former pupils abound with stories of the ‘Ohrfeige’ (ear-boxing) and
‘Haareziehen’ (hair-pulling) they received at his hands.</p>
<p>As news of this brutality reached the children’s parents it
contributed to a growing feeling against him. It was not that the
villagers disapproved of corporal punishment, nor that such methods of
discipline were at all unusual, despite Glöckel’s recommendations.
However, though it was accepted that an unruly boy should have his ears
boxed if he misbehaved, it was not expected that a girl who could not
grasp algebra should receive the same treatment. Indeed, it was not
expected that she should grasp algebra.</p>
<p>The villagers (including some of his own colleagues) were, in any
case, disposed to take a dislike to this aristocratic and eccentric
stranger, whose odd behaviour sometimes amused and sometimes alarmed
them. Anecdotes about his Fremdheit were told and retold, until he
became a kind of village legend. There is the story, for example, of how
he once got together with two of his colleagues to play a Mozart trio –
himself on clarinet, Georg Berger playing the viola part on a violin and
the headmaster, Rupert Köllner, playing the piano part. Berger
recalls:</p>
<p>Again and again we had to start from the beginning, Wittgenstein not
tiring at all.7 Finally we were given a break! The headmaster, Rupert
Köllner, and I were then so unintentionally inconsiderate as to play by
heart some dance tune. Wittgenstein reacted angrily: ‘Krautsalat!
Krautsalat!’ he cried. He then packed up and went.</p>
<p>Another story concerns the time he attended a catechism at the local
Catholic Church. He listened carefully to the questions put to the
children by the priest, with the Dean in attendance, and then said
suddenly, and very audibly: ‘Nonsense!’</p>
<p>But the greatest wonder – and the story for which he was most
remembered by the village – concerns the time he repaired the steam
engine in the local factory, using an apparently miraculous method. The
story is told here by Frau Bichlmayer, the wife of one of Wittgenstein’s
colleagues, who herself worked at the factory:</p>
<p>I was in the office when the engine went dead and the factory had to
stand idle.8 In those days we were dependent on steam. And then a lot of
engineers came, who couldn’t get it to go. Back at home I told my
husband what had happened and my husband then told the story in the
school office and the teacher Wittgenstein said to him: ‘Could I see it,
could you obtain permission for me to take a look at it?’ Then my
husband spoke to the director who said yes, he could come straight away
… so then he came with my husband and went straight down into the engine
room and walked around, saying nothing, just looking around. And then he
said: ‘Can I have four men?’ The director said: yes, and four came, two
locksmiths and two others. Each had to take a hammer and then
Wittgenstein gave each of the men a number and a different place. As I
called they had to hammer their particular spot in sequence: one, four,
three, two …</p>
<p>In this way they cured the machine of its fault.</p>
<p>For this ‘miracle’ Wittgenstein was rewarded with some linen, which
he at first refused, and then accepted on behalf of the poorer children
in his school.</p>
<p>The villagers’ gratitude for this miracle, however, did not outweigh
their growing mistrust of his Fremdheit, and throughout the autumn term
relations between him and them gradually deteriorated. During this term
his sister Hermine kept a watchful and motherly eye on the progress of
his new career. She had to do this indirectly, through Hänsel, because,
while Wittgenstein welcomed visits from his Viennese friends, his family
were under strict instructions not to see him or to offer him any help.
Food parcels were returned unopened, and letters left unanswered.</p>
<p>Hänsel was able to reassure Hermine that, though under some strain,
Wittgenstein had got through the first term reasonably well. On 13
December, she wrote to him with obvious relief:</p>
<p>I am indeed very grateful to you for your kind letter.9 Firstly it
reassured me about the anguish Ludwig has endured through the
Trattenbachers and their curiosity; his letters of that time give a very
encouraging impression and with his laconic way of writing they are
doubly reassuring. Secondly, I greatly appreciate everything you say
about my brother, although it is, in fact, nothing other than what I
myself think. Of course, it is true what you say, though it is not easy
having a saint for a brother, and after the English expression: ‘I had
rather be a live dog than a dead philosopher’ I would like to add: I
would (often) rather have a happy person for a brother than an unhappy
saint.</p>
<p>Ironically, just a few weeks after this letter, on 2 January 1921,
Wittgenstein wrote to Engelmann berating himself for not having chosen
the heavenly course:</p>
<p>I was sorry not to have seen you at Christmas.10 It struck me as
rather funny that you should want to hide from me, for the following
reason: I have been morally dead for more than a year! From that you can
judge for yourself whether I am fine or not. I am one of those cases
which perhaps are not all that rare today: I had a task, did not do it,
and now the failure is wrecking my life. I ought to have done something
positive with my life, to have become a star in the sky. Instead of
which I remained stuck on earth, and now I am gradually fading out. My
life has really become meaningless and so it consists only of futile
episodes. The people around me do not notice this and would not
understand; but I know that I have a fundamental deficiency. Be glad of
it, if you don’t understand what I am writing here.</p>
<p>In the event, Engelmann did not understand.11 If Wittgenstein felt he
had an unfinished task to accomplish, he replied, why did he not do it
now – or at least at some future time when he was ready to do so?
Furthermore, it was surely wrong for him to talk of a fundamental
deficiency; as they had discussed before, no one is so lost that their
position is irrevocable. This time, however, Engelmann’s letter struck
the wrong note. ‘I cannot at present analyse my state in a letter’,
Wittgenstein wrote to him.12 ‘I don’t think – by the way – that you
quite understand it … a visit from you would not suit me in the near
future. Just now we would hardly know what to do with one another.’</p>
<p>For the time being, at least, Engelmann’s place as the person to whom
Wittgenstein turned for an understanding of his inner life had been
taken by Hänsel. In his memoir of Wittgenstein, Hänsel writes: ’One
night, while he was a teacher, he had the feeling that he had been
called but had refused.’13 This perhaps explains Wittgenstein’s mention
to Engelmann of a task, the fulfilment of which would have brought him
to the heavens, but the neglect of which condemned him to remain
earth-bound.fn1</p>
<p>Or, to be more specific, stuck in Trattenbach. During the spring and
summer terms of 1921 Wittgenstein’s earlier delight with Trattenbach
gradually turned to disgust, as his attempts to educate the village
children above the customary expectations met with increasing
misunderstanding and resistance from the parents, from the children
themselves (those of them who felt unable to meet Wittgenstein’s high
expectations) and from his own colleagues.</p>
<p>In March he received from Russell a reply to his enthusiastic letter
of September. ‘I wonder how you like being an elementary schoolteacher’,
Russell wrote, ‘and how you get on with the boys’:16</p>
<p>It is honest work, perhaps as honest as there is, and everybody now
a-days is engaged in some form of humbug, which you escape from.</p>
<p>Russell himself was in good humour, enjoying Peking, and revelling in
the occasional affront he caused to (British) conventional morality by
openly living ‘in sin’ with Dora Black. ‘I like China and the Chinese’,
he told Wittgenstein:</p>
<p>They are lazy, good-natured, fond of laughter, very like nice
children – They are very kind and nice to me – All the nations set upon
them and say they mustn’t be allowed to enjoy life in their own way –
They will be forced to develop an army and navy, to dig up their coal
and smelt their iron, whereas what they want to do is to make verses and
paint pictures (very beautiful) and make strange music, exquisite but
almost inaudible, on many stringed instruments with green tassels. Miss
Black and I live in a Chinese house, built around a courtyard, I send
you a picture of me at the door of my study. My students are all
Bolsheviks, because that is the fashion. They are amazed with me for not
being more of a Bolshevik myself. They are not advanced enough for
mathematical logic. I lecture to them on Psychology, Philosophy,
Politics and Einstein. Once in a while I have them to an evening party
and they set off fire-works in the courtyard. They like this better than
lectures.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein at once let Russell know that his earlier enchantment
with Trattenbach had given way to disgust for its inhabitants. ‘I am
sorry you find the people in your neighbourhood so disagreeable’,
Russell replied.17 ‘I don’t think average human nature is up to much
anywhere, and I dare say wherever you were you would find your
neighbours equally obnoxious.’ No, insisted Wittgenstein, ‘here they are
much more good-for-nothing and irresponsible than elsewhere’.18 Russell
remained unconvinced:</p>
<p>I am very sorry you find the people of Trattenbach so trying.19 But I
refuse to believe they are worse than the rest of the human race: my
logical instinct revolts against the notion.</p>
<p>‘You are right’, Wittgenstein at last conceded; ‘the Trattenbachers
are not uniquely worse than the rest of the human race’:20</p>
<p>But Trattenbach is a particularly insignificant place in Austria and
the Austrians have sunk so miserably low since the war that it’s too
dismal to talk about. That’s what it is.</p>
<p>Russell had told Wittgenstein that he had left the manuscript of the
Tractatus in England with Dorothy Wrinch, a friend of his, ‘a good
mathematician and a student of mathematical logic’, with instructions to
try and get it printed.21 ‘I am determined to get your manuscript
published’, he affirmed, ‘and if it has not been achieved during my
absence, I will take the matter in hand as soon as I return.’</p>
<p>Apart from this encouraging news, the one bright spot in
Wittgenstein’s life during the summer term of 1921 was his relationship
with one of his pupils, a boy from one of the poorest families in the
village, called Karl Gruber. Gruber was a gifted boy who responded well
to Wittgenstein’s methods. Like many of Wittgenstein’s pupils, he
initially found algebra difficult. ‘I could not grasp’, he recalled
later, ‘how one could calculate using letters of the alphabet.’22
However, after receiving from Wittgenstein a box on the ears, he began
to knuckle down: ‘Soon I was the best at algebra in the class.’ At the
end of the summer term, he was due to leave the school and start work at
the local factory. Wittgenstein was determined to do all he could to
continue the boy’s education. On 5 July he wrote to Hänsel explaining
Gruber’s position and asking for advice. Given that his parents could
not afford to send him to a boarding school, what could be done? Might a
free or a cheap place be found for him in one of the middle schools in
Vienna? ‘It would in my opinion’, he wrote, ’be a great pity for the lad
if he could not develop himself further.’23 Hänsel replied suggesting
the possibility of the Calasanzverein, a Catholic establishment in
Vienna which took on poor students. In the meantime, however, it was
decided that Wittgenstein himself should continue to give the boy
lessons, even after he had left the school, and that Hänsel should act
as his occasional examiner, testing him to see that he reached the
standard required to enter one of the Gymnasiums in Vienna.</p>
<p>In the summer vacation Wittgenstein travelled to Norway with Arvid
Sjögren. It was the first time he had been there since 1914, and during
the visit he was finally able to see the house that had been built for
him in his absence. They left with very little money, and had to spend a
night en route in a Salvation Army hostel in Hamburg. It was, as he
explained in a letter to Hänsel, a working holiday: ‘I work from early
in the morning until the evening in a kind of carpentry workshop and
together with Arvid make crates.24 In that way I earn myself a heap of
money.’ As ever, though, the reward he sought for his hard work was
peace of mind. ‘I think it is very good that I made this journey’, he
told Hänsel.</p>
<p>Shortly after his return to Trattenbach, Wittgenstein learnt from
Russell that his book, finally, was to be published. Russell had
returned from China with Dora Black in August, the latter six months
pregnant, and his first two months back in England were taken up with
arrangements to secure the legitimacy of his child. In China he had been
in boat-burning mood, writing to Trinity to resign from the lectureship
he had been offered (‘because’, he later said, ‘I was living in open
sin’) and arranging a divorce from his wife, Alys.25 But the imminent
arrival of a possible heir to the earldom impelled him to take steps
towards respectability. He received his decree absolute from Alys on 21
September, married Dora six days later, and the baby, John Conrad, the
future 4th Earl Russell, was born on 16 November.</p>
<p>Having taken the necessary steps to ensure that his son would inherit
his title, Russell was able to turn his attention to arranging the
publication of Wittgenstein’s book. Through his friend C. K. Ogden he
secured its publication in English in a series of monographs produced by
Kegan Paul called The International Library of Psychology, Philosophy
and Scientific Method, of which Ogden had recently been made editor. The
book was still perceived as a financial liability, but a tolerable one.
‘As they can’t drop less than £50 on doing it I think it very
satisfactory to have got it accepted’, Ogden wrote to Russell on 5
November, ’though of course if they did a second edition soon and the
price of printing went suddenly down they might get their costs
back.’26</p>
<p>Independently of these negotiations, Russell’s friend Dorothy Wrinch
had, while Russell was still in China, secured the book’s acceptance in
a German periodical called Annalen der Naturphilosophie, edited by
Wilhelm Ostwald. Russell, knowing how Wittgenstein felt about the piece
in its German translation, had left his introduction to the book with
Miss Wrinch on the assumption that she would try English publishers.
However, after having it rejected by Cambridge University Press, Miss
Wrinch – considering, no doubt correctly, that this was her only chance
of success – had approached the editors of three German periodicals.
Only from Ostwald had she received a positive reply, and then only
because of Russell’s introduction. ‘In any other case I should have
declined to accept the article’, Ostwald wrote to her on 21
February:27</p>
<p>But I have such an extremely high regard for Mr Bertrand Russell,
both for his researches and for his personality, that I will gladly
publish Mr Wittgenstein’s article in my Annalen der Naturphilosophie: Mr
Bertrand Russell’s Introduction will be particularly welcome.</p>
<p>On 5 November, having received the proofs from Ostwald and a promise
from Ogden that it would appear in the Kegan Paul series, Russell wrote
to Wittgenstein to let him know what was happening. He told him Ostwald
would publish his introduction: ’I am sorry, as I am afraid you won’t
like that, but as you will see from his letter, it can’t be
helped.’28</p>
<p>In a phrase which possibly shocked Wittgenstein, Russell told him:
‘As for me, I am now married to Miss Black, and expecting a child in a
few days’:</p>
<p>We have bought this house [31 Sydney Street, London], and got your
furniture from Cambridge, which we like very much. The child will
probably be born in your bed.</p>
<p>He urged Wittgenstein to come to England, offering to pay his
expenses as further recompense for the furniture: ‘Your things are worth
much more than I paid for them, and I will pay you more whenever you
like. I didn’t know when I bought them how much I was getting.’ In a
later letter he calculated that he owed Wittgenstein a further £200: ‘I
don’t see why I should swindle you because Jolley understated the value
of your things.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein replied on 28 November: ‘I must admit I am pleased my
stuff is going to be printed’, he wrote.29 ‘Even though Ostwald is an
utter charlatan’:</p>
<p>As long as he doesn’t tamper with it! Are you going to read the
proofs? If so, please take care that he prints it exactly as I have it.
He is quite capable of altering the work to suit his own taste – putting
it into his idiotic spelling, for example. What pleases me most is that
the whole thing is going to appear in England.</p>
<p>Russell evidently had little time to read the proofs carefully, and
in any case the book had already gone to print before he received them.
The proofs were therefore left uncorrected. Far from altering the work
to suit his own taste, Ostwald – without, apparently, any interest in or
concern for the meaning of the work he was publishing – simply had it
printed exactly as it was in typescript. Thus one finds, for example –
besides many more ordinary misprints – typewriter symbols where one
would expect to find symbols of Russellian logic: ‘!’ for the Sheffer
stroke; ‘/’ for the negation sign (and occasionally also for the Sheffer
stroke); and the capital letter C for material implication.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was not consulted by Ostwald at any stage in the
publication; nor was he sent any offprints. On being told by Russell
that it was finally in print, he had to write to Hänsel to ask him to
search for a copy of Annalen der Naturphilosophie in the Viennese
bookshops. The search was unsuccessful, and it was not until April of
the following year, when he was sent a copy by Ogden, that Wittgenstein
finally saw how his work had been printed. He was horrified. He regarded
it, so he told Engelmann, as a ‘pirated edition’, and it was not until
the English edition appeared, in 1922, that he considered his work to
have been properly published.</p>
<p>The wheels for the English edition were set in motion by Russell
when, on 6 December, he wrote to Ogden again, sending him Wittgenstein’s
letter of 28 November:</p>
<p>Enclosed from Wittgenstein gives all the authority needed for going
ahead, so you can tell the publishers it is all right … I am much
relieved that W. takes the whole affair sanely.30</p>
<p>During the winter months of 1921–2, using an offprint of Ostwald’s
edition, the book was translated into English by Frank Ramsey, then an
eighteen-year-old undergraduate at King’s, who was a friend of Ogden’s
and was already recognized as a mathematician of outstanding
promise.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein received Ramsey’s translation towards the end of March,
together with a questionnaire asking for his opinion on particular
points that had puzzled both Ogden and Ramsey. In some cases, these
puzzles were the outcome of Ostwald’s careless printing of the German
text; in others, they were due to a faulty understanding of
Wittgenstein’s intended meaning. Which was which was impossible for
Wittgenstein to tell, as he had still not seen a copy of Ostwald’s
edition. Indeed, he was, by now, doubtful that Ostwald had even printed
it – or that he would.</p>
<p>The task of correcting the translation was therefore long and
difficult, but by 23 April Wittgenstein had completed a detailed list of
comments and suggestions, which he sent to Ogden. In the main his
suggestions were motivated by a desire to make the English as natural as
possible, and to relax the literalness of Ramsey’s translation. Not only
was he forced to define particular German words and phrases; he also had
to explain what he had meant by them and then find an English expression
that captured the same meaning and tone. Thus, to a certain extent, the
English version is not simply a translation from the German, but a
reformulation of Wittgenstein’s ideas.</p>
<p>The first question Ogden had raised concerned the title. Ostwald had
published it under Wittgenstein’s German title, Logisch-Philosophische
Abhandlung, which, when translated literally, produces the rather
awkward. ‘Logico-Philosophical Treatise’. Russell had suggested
‘Philosophical Logic’ as an alternative, while Moore – in a conscious
echo of Spinoza’s Tractatus Theologico-Politicus – had put forward
‘Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus’ as ‘obvious and ideal’. It was not, of
course, a title that would reassure the public of the book’s
accessibility, and Ogden felt slightly uneasy about it. ’As a selling
title, he told Russell, ’Philosophical Logic is better, if it conveys
the right impression.’31</p>
<p>The matter was settled by Wittgenstein. ‘I think the Latin one is
better than the present title’, he told Ogden:32</p>
<p>For although ‘Tractatus logico-philosophicus’ isn’t ideal still it
has something like the right meaning, whereas ‘Philosophic logic’ is
wrong. In fact I don’t know what it means! There is no such thing as
philosophic logic. (Unless one says that as the whole book is nonsense
the title might as well be nonsense too.)</p>
<p>The suggestions and comments made by Wittgenstein were given careful
consideration by Ogden (who, in his correspondence with Wittgenstein,
emerges as the most scrupulous and accommodating editor an author could
wish for), and the text was altered in the light of them. By May, work
on the English text was more or less complete.</p>
<p>One problem remained. At the time of preparing the typescript
Wittgenstein had written a series of supplementary remarks, which were,
with one exception, not included in the final text. These supplementary
remarks were numbered, and the exception was No. 72, which was intended
to be proposition 4.0141, an elaboration of the preceding remark
comparing the pictorial relation between language and the world with the
relation between a musical thought, a gramophone record and a musical
score. However, in Ostwald’s edition proposition 4.0141 reads, rather
bizarrely: ‘(Siehe Ergänzung Nr. 72)’. He had evidently either lost or
never received the supplementary list, and presumably found this no more
unintelligible than the other propositions in the book. It was left for
Ogden to query Ramsey’s translation: ‘(See Supplement No. 72)’. ‘What is
this?’ asked Ogden.33 ‘There is presumably some mistake.’</p>
<p>In his reply, Wittgenstein explained about the supplements and
provided Ogden with a translation of the one he had intended to include
in the book. This raised in Ogden’s mind the intriguing possibility that
there might be more supplements to elucidate and expand what was, after
all, a rather difficult – and short – book.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein refused to send any more. ‘There can be no thought of
printing them’, he told Ogden.34 ‘The supplements are exactly what must
not be printed. Besides THEY REALLY CONTAIN NO ELUCIDATIONS AT ALL, but
are still less clear than the rest of my props’:</p>
<p>As to the shortness of the book I am awfully sorry for it; but what
can I do? If you were to squeeze me like a lemon you would get nothing
more out of me. To let you print the Ergänzungen would be no remedy. It
would be just as if you had gone to a joiner and ordered a table and he
had made the table too short and now would sell you the shavings and
sawdust and other rubbish along with the table to make up for its
shortness. (Rather than print the Ergänzungen to make the book fatter
leave a dozen white sheets for the reader to swear into when he has
purchased the book and can’t understand it.)</p>
<p>In June, when the book was ready to print, Wittgenstein was sent by
Ogden a declaration to sign giving Kegan Paul all publication rights of
the book, ‘In consideration of their issuing it in German and English in
the “International Library of Psychology andandandand Philosophy” under
the title Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus’.35 Under the terms of this
contract, Wittgenstein was paid nothing for the rights of the book and
entitled to no royalties from its sales. When, in 1933, a reprint was
planned, he attempted to persuade Kegan Paul to pay him a royalty, but
they did not respond, which is why he took his later work to a different
publisher. At the time, however, he was less concerned with payment than
with ensuring that Ellen Pinsent, David’s mother, should be sent a
complimentary copy. With every letter he wrote to Ogden during the final
stages of publication, he asked him to trace Mrs Pinsent and to make
sure she received a copy.</p>
<p>The proofs were ready in July, and Wittgenstein returned them, duly
corrected, in the first week of August. The publishers seem to have
wanted to print some details of Wittgenstein’s biography and the
peculiar circumstances in which the book was written, mentioning the
prison camp at Monte Cassino, and so on. To this Wittgenstein responded
with scathing contempt. ‘As to your note about the Italian monastery
etc. etc.’, he wrote to Ogden on 4 August, ‘do as you please’:36</p>
<p>… only I can’t for my life see the point of it. Why should the
general reviewer know my age? Is it as much as to say: You can’t expect
more of a young chap especially when he writes a book in such a noise as
must have been on the Austrian front? If I knew that the general
reviewer believed in astrology I would suggest to print the date and
hour of my birth in front of the book that he might set the horoscope
for me. (26/IV 1889, 6 p.m.)</p>
<p>By the time the book was published, Wittgenstein had left
Trattenbach. He had hinted to Russell as early as 23 October that this
was to be his last year there, ‘because I don’t get on here even with
the other teachers’, and from then on his life in Trattenbach became
progressively more difficult.37 He was determined to raise the sights of
at least the more able of his students, and the private lessons he was
giving Karl Gruber were extended to include also some of his better
pupils from his new class. These included Emmerich Koderhold and Oskar
Fuchs. From the parents of all three he encountered resistance. When he
wanted to take Fuchs to Vienna to see a play, he was refused, Fuchs’s
mother not wishing to entrust her boy to ‘that crazy fellow’. When he
suggested to Koderhold’s father that his son had the ability to attend a
grammar school in Vienna, and should do so, he was told that it was out
of the question; the boy was needed to help run the farm. His biggest
disappointment, however, was with Karl Gruber, the most talented of his
students. Every day after school, from four o’clock until half past
seven, Wittgenstein conducted Gruber through an intensive study,
concentrating on Latin, mathematics, geography and history. From time to
time Gruber’s progress was examined by Hänsel, especially in Latin, the
subject Wittgenstein felt least qualified to teach. The plan was to see
Gruber through a grammar school in Vienna. While attending school Gruber
was to live with Hermine, and herein lay a difficulty: ‘I would have
felt it as a humiliation’, Gruber later explained:38</p>
<p>I didn’t want to beg for alms and would have felt myself to be
receiving charity. I would have come there as a ‘poor chap’ and would
have had to say thank you for every bit of bread.</p>
<p>Perhaps for this reason, or perhaps simply because he had been worn
down by the effort of studying for three and a half hours every day
while working at the local factory, receiving nothing but discouragement
from his family, Gruber told Wittgenstein he did not want to continue
with his lessons. On 16 February 1921 Wittgenstein wrote to Hänsel:
’Today I had a conversation with Gruber who came to me to bring some
books back. It turns out that he has no enthusiasm to go on with his
studies … Of course he has no conception of where he is now heading.
i.e. he does not know how bad a step he is taking. But how should he
know. Sad! Sad!’39</p>
<p>‘I wish you didn’t have to work so hard at elementary teaching’,
Russell wrote to him on 7 February; ’it must be very dreary.’40
Wittgenstein replied that he had indeed felt very depressed lately, but
not because he found teaching in an elementary school repugnant: ’On the
contrary!’41</p>
<p>But it is hard to have to be a teacher in this country where the
people are so completely and utterly hopeless. In this place I do not
have a soul with whom I can exchange a single reasonable word. God knows
how I will be able to stand it for much longer!</p>
<p>Russell had written of how he ‘liked China much better than Europe’:
‘the people are more civilized – I keep wishing I were back there’. Yes,
Wittgenstein replied, ‘I can well believe that you found it more
pleasant in China than in England, although in England it is doubtless a
thousand times better than here.’</p>
<p>In his correspondence with Ogden, also, there are some indications
that he was already beginning to look towards England, in order to be
with at least a few people to whom he could talk. In his letters he
frequently asks after, and asks to be remembered to, his old friends at
Cambridge – Johnson and Keynes in particular.</p>
<p>Throughout the summer term he looked forward with great anticipation
and pleasure to a proposed meeting with Russell, who was planning to
visit the Continent to stay with his brother and wife at their home in
Switzerland. Originally, the plan was for Wittgenstein to join the
Russells there, but this was changed in favour of meeting for an
over-night stay in Innsbruck. The tone of the letters that were
exchanged to make this arrangement is warm and friendly, and gives no
hint of the differences between the two that were to emerge. They
exchanged comments on the baleful situation of Europe, told each other
how much they were looking forward to their meeting, and Wittgenstein
asked affectionately after Russell’s wife and baby (‘The little boy is
lovely’, Russell replied.42 ‘At first he looked exactly like Kant, but
now he looks more like a baby.’)</p>
<p>And yet the meeting proved to be a great disappointment on both
sides, and was, in fact, the last time the two met as friends. According
to Dora Russell, it was the ‘circumstances of the time’ that made it a
‘troubled meeting’.43 Inflation in Austria was then at its height, and:
‘The whole place was full of ghouls and vultures, tourists profiting by
the cheap currency to have a good time at the Austrians’ expense’:</p>
<p>We all tramped the streets trying to find rooms in which to stay;
Wittgenstein was in an agony of wounded pride at the state of his
country and his inability to show some sort of hospitality.</p>
<p>Eventually, they took a single room, the Russells occupying the bed
while Wittgenstein slept on the couch. ‘But the hotel had a terrace,
where it was pleasant enough to sit while Bertie discussed how to get
Wittgenstein to England.’ She strenuously denies that they quarrelled on
this occasion: ‘Wittgenstein was never easy, but I think any differences
must have been over their philosophical ideas.’</p>
<p>Russell himself, however, remembers the differences as religious.
Wittgenstein was, he said, ‘much pained by the fact of my not being a
Christian’,44 and was at the time: ‘at the height of his mystic
ardour’.45 He: ‘assured me with great earnestness that it is better to
be good than clever’, but was, nevertheless (Russell seems to see an
amusing paradox here), ‘terrified of wasps and, because of bugs, unable
to stay another night in lodgings we had found in Innsbruck’.46</p>
<p>In later life Russell gave the impression that, after their meeting
at Innsbruck, Wittgenstein considered him too wicked to associate with,
and so abandoned all contact. Russell enjoyed being thought wicked, and
this is no doubt the aspect of the meeting that stayed freshest in his
memory. Wittgenstein did, indeed, disapprove of his sexual mores, and
had before their meeting in Innsbruck attempted to steer him in the
direction of religious contemplation by suggesting he read Lessing’s
Religiösen Streitschriften (a suggestion Russell did not take up). But
it is not true that Wittgenstein avoided all contact with Russell after
they had met at Innsbruck; he wrote at least two letters to him in the
months following the meeting, each of which begins: ’I have heard
nothing from you for a long time.’47</p>
<p>The indications are, then, that it was Russell who broke off
communication. Perhaps the truth is that he found Wittgenstein’s
religious earnestness too tiresome to tolerate. For, if it is true that
Wittgenstein was at the ‘height of his mystic ardour’, it is equally
true that Russell was at the height of his atheist acerbity. Gone was
the Ottoline-inspired transcendentalism of ‘The Essence of Religion’ and
‘Mysticism and Logic’; in its place was a fierce anti-Christianity,
which, in his now familiar role as a public speaker and a popular
writer, he never lost an opportunity to express.</p>
<p>There is, too, the related, and perhaps still deeper, difference upon
which Engelmann places so much emphasis: the difference between trying
to improve the world, and seeking only to improve oneself. And, again,
it is not just that Wittgenstein had become more introspective and
individualistic, but that Russell had become much less so. The war had
made him a socialist, and had convinced him of the urgent need to change
the way the world was governed; questions of personal morality were
subordinated by him to the overriding public concern to make the world a
safer place. There is a story told by Engelmann which illustrates this
difference in its starkest form, and which must surely refer to the
meeting at Innsbruck:</p>
<p>When, in the ’twenties, Russell wanted to establish, or join, a
‘World Organization for Peace and Freedom’ or something similar,
Wittgenstein rebuked him so severely, that Russell said to him: ‘Well, I
suppose you would rather establish a World Organization for War and
Slavery’, to which Wittgenstein passionately assented: ’Yes, rather
that, rather that!’48</p>
<p>If this is true, then it may well have been Russell who regarded
Wittgenstein as too wicked to associate with. For there can be no more
complete repudiation of the ethical view upon which he based the rest of
his life’s activities.</p>
<p>In any case, Russell made no further attempt to communicate with
Wittgenstein or to persuade him to come to England. If Wittgenstein was
to escape the ‘odiousness and baseness’ of the Austrian peasantry, it
would not be through his old teacher at Cambridge.</p>
<p>That Wittgenstein’s spell as an elementary school teacher in
Trattenbach had not been a success was due in large measure to his very
devotion to the task. His high expectations and his stern means of
enforcing them had baffled and frightened all but a minority of his
pupils; he had aroused the hostility of their parents and had failed to
get on even with his own colleagues. And, as he had been forced to admit
by Russell, there was nothing uniquely evil about the people at
Trattenbach – he was very likely to encounter the same reaction
elsewhere.</p>
<p>There are some indications that, if he could have found something
better to do, he would have left school-teaching altogether. As well as
talking to Russell about returning to England, he also discussed the
possibility with Engelmann of a ‘flight to Russia’. What he would have
done in either place, he did not know. Certainly not philosophy – he had
said all he had to say about that in his book.</p>
<p>In the event, September 1922 saw him starting at a new school in the
same area as Trattenbach, this time a secondary school in a village
called Hassbach. He did so without any great hopes. Before he started
there he reported to Engelmann that he had formed ‘a very disagreeable
impression of the new environment there (teachers, parish priest,
etc.)’.49 These people, he said, ‘are not human at all but loathsome
worms’. It had perhaps been thought that he would find it easier to get
on with secondary school teachers, but in fact he found their pretence
to ‘specialized learning’ utterly unbearable, and soon wished to return
to an elementary school. He stayed barely a month.</p>
<p>In November he started at a primary school in Puchberg, a pleasant
village in the Schneeberg mountains, now a popular skiing resort. Again,
he found it difficult to discern any humanity in the people around him;
in fact, he told Russell, they were not really people at all, but
one-quarter animal and three-quarters human.50</p>
<p>He had not been at Puchberg long before he at last received finished
copies of the Tractatus. He wrote to Ogden on 15 November: ‘They really
look nice. I wish their contents were half as good as their external
appearance.’51 He wondered whether Johnson – the first two volumes of
whose three-volume work on logic had also recently been published –
would buy it: ‘I should like to know what he thinks about it. If you see
him please give him my love.’</p>
<p>There was, naturally, no one at Puchberg with whom he could discuss
philosophy, but he did, at least, find someone with whom he could share
his passion for music in Rudolf Koder, a very talented pianist, who
taught music at the school. On hearing Koder playing the ‘Moonlight’
Sonata, Wittgenstein walked into the music room and introduced himself.
From then on the two would meet almost every afternoon to play duets for
clarinet and piano – the clarinet sonatas by Brahms and Labor, and
arrangements of the clarinet quintets of Brahms and Mozart.</p>
<p>Later, they were joined in these musical sessions by a local
coal-miner called Heinrich Postl, a member of the village choir. Postl,
who became a good friend and a kind of protégé of Wittgenstein’s, was
later employed as a porter and caretaker by the Wittgenstein family.
Wittgenstein gave him copies of some of his favourite books – Tolstoy’s
Gospel in Brief and Hebel’s Schatzkästlein – and sought to impress upon
him his own moral teaching. Thus, when Postl once remarked that he
wished to improve the world, Wittgenstein replied: ’Just improve
yourself; that is the only thing you can do to better the world.’52</p>
<p>Aside from Koder and Postl, Wittgenstein made few friends among the
staff and villagers at Puchberg. As at Trattenbach, his teaching
inspired a few of his pupils to heights they otherwise would not have
attained, and antagonized the parents because of the disruption caused
to their work at home.</p>
<p>While Wittgenstein was struggling to teach primary school children,
the Tractatus was becoming the subject of much attention within the
academic community. At Vienna University the mathematician Hans Hahn
gave a seminar on the book in 1922, and it later attracted the attention
also of a group of philosophers led by Moritz Schlick – the group that
evolved into the famous Vienna Circle of Logical Positivists. In
Cambridge, too, the Tractatus became the centre of discussion for a
small but influential group of dons and students. The first public
discussion of the book in Cambridge was probably in January 1923, when
Richard Braithwaite addressed the Moral Science Club on the subject of
‘Wittgenstein’s logic as expounded in his Tractatus
Logico-Philosophicus’.</p>
<p>For a time, Wittgenstein’s only contact at Cambridge remained Ogden,
who in March sent Wittgenstein his recently published book The Meaning
of Meaning, written jointly with the poet and literary critic I. A.
Richards. Ogden regarded the book as providing a causal solution to the
problem of meaning addressed by Wittgenstein in the Tractatus.
Wittgenstein regarded it as an irrelevance. ‘I think I ought to confess
to you frankly’, he wrote, ’that I believe you have not caught the
problems which – for instance – I was at in my book (whether or not I
have given the correct solution).’53 In a letter to Russell of 7 April,
he went further:</p>
<p>A short time ago I received ‘The Meaning of Meaning’.54 It has surely
also been sent to you. Is it not a miserable book?! Philosophy is not as
easy as that! From this one sees how easy it is to write a thick book.
The worst thing is the introduction of Professor Postgate Litt.D.F.B.A.
etc. etc. I have seldom read anything so foolish.</p>
<p>It was the second letter Wittgenstein had written to Russell since
their ill-starred meeting at Innsbruck, and he was impatient for a
reply. ‘Write to me sometime’, he pleaded, ‘how everything’s going with
you and what your baby’s up to; whether he is already studying logic
fluently.’</p>
<p>Russell appears not to have replied. Wittgenstein’s categoric
dismissal of Ogden’s work possibly irritated him, since he himself saw
little to criticize in the book. It was, in many ways, simply a
restatement of what he himself had already said in The Analysis of Mind.
Shortly afterwards, Wittgenstein was shocked to read in The Nation a
favourable review by Russell of the book, describing it as ‘undoubtedly
important’. From Frank Ramsey he learnt that Russell ‘does not really
think The Meaning of Meaning important, but he wants to help Ogden by
encouraging the sale of it’ – an explanation certain to have increased
Wittgenstein’s disapproval, and to have confirmed him in his growing
belief that Russell was no longer serious.55 In the 1930s Wittgenstein
once or twice attempted (unsuccessfully) to interest Russell in the
philosophical work that he was then doing, but he never again addressed
Russell warmly, as a friend.</p>
<p>Increasingly isolated as he was (‘To my great shame’, he wrote to
Engelmann, ‘I must confess that the number of people to whom I can talk
is constantly diminishing’), Wittgenstein needed friends.56 When,
through Ogden, he was sent Keynes’s ‘Reconstruction in Europe’ –
published as a special supplement to the Manchester Guardian – he tried
writing directly to Keynes to thank him. ‘I should have preferred to
have got a line from you personally’, he told him, ‘saying how you are
getting on, etc’:57</p>
<p>Or, are you too busy to write letters? I don’t suppose you are. Do
you ever see Johnson? If so, please give him my love. I should so much
like to hear from him too (not about my book but about himself).</p>
<p>So do write to me sometime, if you will condescend to do such a
thing.</p>
<p>It took Keynes over a year to reply. ‘Did Keynes write to me?’
Wittgenstein asked Ogden on 27 March 1923.58 ‘If so, please tell him it
hasn’t reached me.’ He even gave Ogden his Puchberg address again –
despite having given it him twice before – just in case Keynes’s letter
had been misdirected.</p>
<p>It was Keynes who could (and eventually did) persuade Wittgenstein to
return to England. In the meantime, contact with Cambridge was kept up
through a friend of Keynes’s, a fellow Apostle and member of King’s
College: Frank Ramsey.</p>
<p>Of the people at Cambridge who studied the Tractatus in its first
year of publication, Ramsey was undoubtedly the most perceptive. Though
still an undergraduate (in 1923 he was still just nineteen years old),
he was commissioned to write a review of Wittgenstein’s work for the
philosophical journal, Mind. The review remains to this day one of the
most reliable expositions, and one of the most penetrating criticisms,
of the work. It begins in Russellian vein:</p>
<p>This is a most important book containing original ideas on a large
range of topics, forming a coherent system, which whether or not it be,
as the author claims, in essentials the final solution of the problems
dealt with, is of extraordinary interest and deserves the attention of
all philosophers.59</p>
<p>But Ramsey then goes on to take issue with some of the
misunderstandings contained in Russell’s introduction – for example,
Russell’s misconception that Wittgenstein was concerned with the
possibility of a ‘logically perfect language’ – and to give a fuller and
more reliable exposition of the main lines of the book.</p>
<p>When Wittgenstein heard from Ogden that Ramsey intended to visit
Vienna in the summer vacation of 1923, he wrote to Ramsey himself,
inviting him to Puchberg. Ramsey gratefully accepted, and arrived on 17
September, not quite knowing what to expect. He stayed about two weeks,
during which time Wittgenstein devoted about five hours a day – from
when he finished school at two o’clock in the afternoon until seven in
the evening – to going through the Tractatus line by line with him. ‘It
is most illuminating’, Ramsey wrote to Ogden; ‘he seems to enjoy this
and we get on about a page an hour’:60</p>
<p>He is very interested in it, although he says that his mind is no
longer flexible and he can never write another book. He teaches in the
village school from 8 to 12 or 1. He is very poor and seems to lead a
dreary life having only one friend here, and being regarded by most of
his colleagues as a little mad.</p>
<p>In going through the book in such detail, Wittgenstein made some
corrections and changes to the text which were incorporated in later
editions. For both Wittgenstein and Ramsey, it was important that Ramsey
should understand the book thoroughly, in every last detail.
Wittgenstein was concerned lest Ramsey should forget everything when he
returned to England – as Moore had appeared to have done when he came to
Norway in 1914. ‘It’s terrible’, Ramsey wrote to his mother, ’when he
says “Is that clear” and I say “no” and he says “Damn it’s horrid to go
through that again.”’61</p>
<p>Ramsey intended to make Wittgenstein’s work the basis for a theory of
higher mathematics. When they had finished going through the book, he
wrote, ‘I shall try to pump him for ideas for its further development
which I shall attempt’:62</p>
<p>He says he himself will do nothing more, not because he is bored, but
because his mind is no longer flexible. He says no one can do more than
5 or 10 years work at philosophy. (His book took 7.) And he is sure
Russell will do nothing more important.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein seemed to support Ramsey’s plan, at least to the extent
of agreeing that something should take the place of Russell’s Principia
Mathematica. He struck Ramsey as ‘a little annoyed’ that Russell was
planning a new edition of Principia: ‘because he thought that he had
shown R that it was so wrong that a new edition would be futile. It must
be done altogether afresh.’</p>
<p>As for Wittgenstein’s present living conditions, Ramsey was somewhat
dismayed:</p>
<p>He is very poor, at least he lives very economically.63 He has one
tiny room whitewashed, containing a bed, washstand, small table and one
hard chair and that is all there is room for. His evening meal which I
shared last night is rather unpleasant coarse bread, butter and
cocoa.</p>
<p>He was, however, impressed by Wittgenstein’s youthful appearance and
his athletic vigour. ‘In explaining his philosophy he is excited and
makes vigorous gestures but relieves the tension by a charming laugh.’
He was inclined to think that Wittgenstein ‘exaggerates his own verbal
inspiration’, but of his genius he had no doubt:</p>
<p>He is great. I used to think Moore a great man but beside W!</p>
<p>From Wittgenstein’s point of view, the discussions with Ramsey
provided a stimulating and pleasant – if strenuous – change from his
normal routine, and also a welcome link with Cambridge. He told Ramsey
that he was likely to leave Puchberg at the end of the school year, but
had no firm idea of what he would do after that – perhaps find a job as
a gardener, or perhaps come to England to look for work. He asked Ramsey
to investigate whether he was entitled to receive a BA degree from
Cambridge on the basis of the six terms he had spent with Russell before
the war, with perhaps the Tractatus being accepted as a BA thesis.</p>
<p>On Ramsey’s return to Cambridge for the Michaelmas term, he and
Wittgenstein entered into a warm and friendly correspondence. In one of
his first letters Ramsey explained (what he had found out from Keynes)
that the regulations governing the eligibility of Cambridge degrees had
changed. It was no longer possible to obtain a BA degree by keeping six
terms’ residence and submitting a thesis. If Wittgenstein wanted a
degree he would have to come back to Cambridge for at least another year
and then submit a thesis. In this way he could hope to obtain a
Ph.D.</p>
<p>Through Ramsey, Keynes tried to entice Wittgenstein to England by
offering him £50 to pay his expenses. He at first tried to make this
offer anonymously, but, on being asked directly, Ramsey had to admit:
‘the £50 belong to Keynes’:64</p>
<p>He asked me not to say so straight away because he was afraid you
might be less likely to take it from him than from an unknown source, as
he has never written to you. I can’t understand why he hasn’t written,
nor can he explain, he says he must have some ‘complex’ about it. He
speaks of you with warm affection and very much wants to see you
again.</p>
<p>Ramsey even wrote to Wittgenstein’s nephew, Thomas Stonborough (whom
he had got to know at Cambridge), to convince him of the same point:
‘Keynes very much wants to see L. W. again and his offer of £50 is
really better evidence of that, than his failure to answer letters is of
the contrary.65 He speaks of L.W. with considerable affection.’</p>
<p>This marks the beginning of a long campaign to persuade Wittgenstein,
first to visit England for a summer holiday, and then to abandon
teaching and resume philosophical work at Cambridge. Ramsey did his best
to allay Wittgenstein’s fears about entering Cambridge society after
such a long absence – an absence in which he had changed a great deal
and had lived, to a large extent, away from any kind of society. On 20
December he wrote that he could quite understand this fear, ‘but you
mustn’t give it any weight’:66</p>
<p>I could get lodgings in Cambridge and you need not see more of people
than you like or feel able to. I can see that staying with people might
be difficult as you would inevitably be with them a lot, but if you
lived by yourself you could come into society gradually.</p>
<p>I don’t want you to take this as endorsing your fear of boring or
annoying people, for I know I myself want to see you awfully, but I just
want to say that if you have such a fear surely it would be all right if
you were not staying with anyone but lived alone first.</p>
<p>As Ramsey realized later, this line of attack was fruitless – the
last thing Wittgenstein wanted was to live alone in England. But in any
case, by February 1924 he gave up trying to persuade Wittgenstein to
come to England for the summer and instead told him of his plan to go to
Vienna.</p>
<p>Ramsey had for some time been interested in the prospect of being
psychoanalysed. Originally this had been because of the emotional
turmoil occasioned by an ‘unhappy passion’ for a married woman. In the
Lent term of 1924 he returned to the idea after suffering from
depression. This, together with a desire to have a break from Cambridge
before he started his intended academic career, culminated in the
decision to spend six months in Vienna. His choice of Vienna was not
simply dictated by his desire to undergo psychoanalysis, but was also
influenced by the fact that, while there, he could see Wittgenstein
regularly to discuss his work.</p>
<p>In connection with his own work, he had recently been to see Russell
to help him with the new edition of Principia Mathematica. Russell gave
him the manuscript of the revisions that he intended to include in the
new edition, in order for him to comment on them. What criticisms Ramsey
made are unrecorded. The new introduction states merely that ‘the
authors’ (referring to Russell and Whitehead, although in fact Russell
alone was responsible for the changes) were ‘under great obligations’ to
Ramsey.</p>
<p>To Wittgenstein, however, Ramsey was quite scathing of the
project:</p>
<p>You are quite right that it is of no importance; all it really
amounts to is a clever proof of mathematical induction without using the
axiom of reducibility.67 There are no fundamental changes, identity as
it used to be. I felt he was too old: he seemed to understand and say
‘yes’ to each separate thing, but it made no impression so that 3
minutes afterwards he talked on his old lines. Of all your work he seems
now to accept only this: that it is nonsense to put an adjective where a
substantive ought to be which helps in his theory of types.</p>
<p>The new edition, indeed, seemed to please no one. While Wittgenstein
and Ramsey thought it paid too little attention to Wittgenstein’s
criticisms, Whitehead considered it too Wittgensteinian and published a
paper dissenting from the new ideas that Russell had included.</p>
<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Ramsey went to Vienna in March. He travelled with Thomas Stonborough,
and on the journey was briefed by him on some salient facts about the
Wittgenstein family – that three of Wittgenstein’s brothers had
committed suicide, and that three sisters and a fourth brother remained,
all of whom lived in Vienna. Having met Thomas Stonborough, it must have
become apparent to Ramsey that his assessment of Wittgenstein as ‘very
poor’ would have to be slightly amended. In Paris he was introduced to
Jerome Stonborough, Thomas’s father, who, he told his mother, ‘looked
just a prosperous American’.68</p>
<p>In Vienna Ramsey saw for himself the scale of the Wittgenstein family
wealth when he made the acquaintance of Margarete, who was at this time
living in the Schönborn Palace: ‘She must be collossally wealthy.’ He
was invited to a dinner party at the palace the following Saturday: ‘As
far as I could make out the party consisted of Wittgensteins, mostly
female, professors, and friends of Tommy, the son, mostly male.69 So
there was a good majority of males.’ Music was provided by a
professional string quartet, who played first Haydn and then Beethoven.
Ramsey preferred the Haydn, but was told that this gave him away – ‘what
I didn’t mind as I couldn’t avoid it sooner or later’. After dinner he
talked to Paul Wittgenstein – ‘a brother, who is a celebrated pianist
who lost an arm in the war and now plays with one hand. Lionel had heard
of him without connecting him with Ludwig’ – and was invited out to
lunch by Paul and Hermine.</p>
<p>Having met the family, Ramsey had a better understanding of the
completely self-inflicted nature of Wittgenstein’s situation. He wrote
to Keynes to explain that it was probably no good ‘trying to get him to
live any pleasanter life, or stop the ridiculous waste of his energy and
brain’:70</p>
<p>I only see this clearly now because I have got to know one of his
sisters and met the rest of the family. They are very rich and extremely
anxious to give him money or do anything for him in any way, and he
rejects all their advances; even Christmas presents or presents of
invalid’s food, when he is ill, he sends back. And this is not because
they aren’t on good terms but because he won’t have any money he hasn’t
earned except for some very specific purpose like to come and see you
again. I think he teaches to earn money and would only stop teaching if
he had some other way of earning which was preferable. And it would have
to be really earning, he wouldn’t accept any job which seemed in the
least to be wangled for him. It is an awful pity.</p>
<p>He even put forward the basis of a psychological explanation: ‘it
seems to be the result of a terribly strict upbringing. Three of his
brothers committed suicide – they were made to work so hard by their
father: at one time the eight children had twenty-six private tutors;
and their mother took no interest in them.’</p>
<p>At the end of his first week in Vienna, Ramsey travelled to Puchberg
to spend a day with Wittgenstein. His mind was chiefly on his
psychoanalysis, and he had not intended to talk to Wittgenstein about
his work on the foundations of mathematics. It appears, however, that he
made some effort to do so, but found Wittgenstein’s response
disappointing. ‘Wittgenstein seemed to me tired’, he wrote to his
mother, ‘though not ill; but it isn’t really any good talking to him
about work, he won’t listen.71 If you suggest a question he won’t listen
to your answer but starts thinking of one for himself. And it is such
hard work for him like pushing something too heavy uphill.’</p>
<p>After his visit to Puchberg, Ramsey wrote to Keynes underlining the
importance of getting Wittgenstein out of the hostile environment in
which he had placed himself:</p>
<p>… if he were got away from his surroundings and were not so tired,
and had me to stimulate him, he might do some more very good work; and
he might conceivably have come to England with that in view.72 But while
he is teaching here I don’t think he will do anything, his thinking is
so obviously frightfully uphill work as if he were worn out. If I am
here during his summer holiday I might try to stimulate him then.</p>
<p>It appears Wittgenstein had asked Ramsey to write to Keynes
explaining his attitude to visiting England, convinced that he could not
express the matter adequately in English, and that Keynes wouldn’t
understand it if he wrote in German. Wittgenstein, Ramsey explained, had
severe misgivings about coming to England to renew old acquaintances. He
felt he could no longer talk to Russell, and the quarrel with Moore had
remained unhealed; there remained only Keynes and Hardy. He wanted very
much to get to know Keynes again, but only if he could renew their old
intimacy; he did not want to come to England and see Keynes only
occasionally and establish only a superficial acquaintanceship. He had
changed so much since the war, he felt, that unless he spent a lot of
time with Keynes, Keynes would never understand him.</p>
<p>He would therefore be prepared to come to England if Keynes were
prepared to invite him to stay as a guest in his country home, and were
willing to spend a great deal of time getting to know him again.</p>
<p>Ramsey ended his explanation of this with a warning:</p>
<p>I’m afraid I think you would find it difficult and exhausting.73
Though I like him very much I doubt if I could enjoy him for more than a
day or two, unless I had my great interest in his work, which provides
the mainstay of our conversation.</p>
<p>But, he added, ‘I should be pleased if you did get him to come and
see you, as it might possibly get him out of this groove.’</p>
<p>For the time being, Keynes did not respond to the suggestion that he
should invite Wittgenstein to spend the summer with him in the country;
he possibly considered the demands involved too great. He had, however –
on 29 March, apparently before seeing Ramsey’s letter – finally replied
to Wittgenstein’s letter of the previous year. He explained the long
delay as being caused by his desire to understand the Tractatus before
he wrote: ‘yet my mind is now so far from fundamental questions that it
is impossible for me to get clear about such matters’:74</p>
<p>I still do not know what to say about your book, except that I feel
certain it is a work of extraordinary importance and genius. Right or
wrong, it dominates all fundamental discussions at Cambridge since it
was written.</p>
<p>He sent Wittgenstein some of his recent books, including The Economic
Consequences of the Peace, and urged him to come to England, stressing:
‘I would do anything in my power which could make it easier for you to
do further work.’</p>
<p>This last statement, for the moment at least, struck the wrong note.
It was not that Wittgenstein wanted to resume philosophical work, but
that he wanted badly to re-establish old friendships. He replied only in
July, writing half in English, half in German, and insisting there was
nothing that could be done to enable him to return to philosophy:</p>
<p>… because I myself no longer have any strong inner drive towards that
sort of activity.75 Everything that I really had to say, I have said,
and so the spring has run dry. That sounds queer, but it’s how things
are.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he told Keynes, if he had any work to do in
England, even sweeping the streets or cleaning boots, ‘I would come over
with great pleasure’. Without such a job, the only thing that would make
it worthwhile for him to come would be if Keynes were prepared to see
him on something more than a casual basis. It would be nice, he said, to
see Keynes again, but: ‘staying in rooms and having tea with you every
other day or so would not be nice enough’. It would be necessary, for
the reasons that Ramsey had already outlined, for them to work hard at
establishing an intimate relationship:</p>
<p>We haven’t met since 11 years. I don’t know if you have changed
during that time, but I certainly have tremendously. I am sorry to say I
am no better than I was, but I am different. And therefore if we shall
meet you may find that the man who has come to see you isn’t really the
one you meant to invite. There is no doubt that, even if we can make
ourselves understood to one another, a chat or two will not be
sufficient for the purpose, and that the result of our meeting will be
disappointment and disgust on your side and disgust and despair on
mine.</p>
<p>As it was, no such complications arose, because no such invitation
was forthcoming. Wittgenstein spent the summer in Vienna.</p>
<p>He had already decided that the summer term of 1924 would be his last
at Puchberg, although he appears to have been relatively happy at this
time. When Ramsey visited him in May he reported to his mother that
Wittgenstein seemed more cheerful: ‘he has spent weeks preparing the
skeleton of a cat for his children, which he seemed to enjoy’.76 ‘But’,
he wrote, ‘he is no good for my work.’</p>
<p>Ramsey’s respect for Wittgenstein had not diminished in any way.
Later, he was to write:</p>
<p>We really live in a great time for thinking, with Einstein, Freud and
Wittgenstein all alive (and all living in Germany or Austria, those foes
of civilisation!).77</p>
<p>But although he stayed in Austria throughout the summer, he made
little effort to see much of Wittgenstein. When Ogden wrote to him
asking for the corrections to the text of the Tractatus made during the
discussions of the previous year, he replied that he wouldn’t be seeing
Wittgenstein again until September, shortly before his return to
England. Ogden apparently wanted the material in case a new edition
should be published, but at the time this looked an unlikely prospect.
Ramsey’s letter ends: ’I’m sorry so few have sold.’78</p>
<p>Ramsey spent the summer completing his course in psychoanalysis and
working on his dissertation. While still in Vienna he received the news
that, at the extraordinarily early age of twenty-one, he was to become a
Fellow of King’s College upon his return to Cambridge. Before he left he
made only one more visit to Wittgenstein. He told him beforehand: ’I
don’t much want to talk about mathematics as I haven’t been doing much
lately.’79</p>
<p>This was, in all probability, a polite way of saying that, so long as
Wittgenstein continued ‘this ridiculous waste of his energy and brain’,
he was likely to remain ‘no good’ for Ramsey’s work.</p>
<p>In what was to be his last attempt to raise the sights of the
children of rural Austria, and to withstand the hostility of their
parents and of his fellow teachers, Wittgenstein, in September 1924,
started at yet another village school, this time at Otterthal, a
neighbouring village of Trattenbach.</p>
<p>Given his experience of Trattenbach, it is perhaps surprising that he
should have chosen to return to the Wechsel mountains. But there was
some hope that he would enjoy better relations with his colleagues. So,
at least, Hermine thought. Almost as soon as Wittgenstein moved to
Otterthal, she wrote to Hänsel asking if he had any plans to visit her
brother. ‘I would, naturally,’ she said, ‘be very happy if someone could
tell me how Ludwig is getting on there, I mean how relations with the
school are’:80</p>
<p>It cannot, I think, be completely without friction, since his
teaching programme is so different from that of the other teachers, but
at least one might hope that the friction should not result in his being
ground to dust.</p>
<p>The head of the school in Otterthal was Josef Putre, whom
Wittgenstein had befriended while at Trattenbach. Putre was a socialist
and an enthusiastic proponent of Glöckel’s School Reform Movement, and
in his first two years of teaching Wittgenstein had often turned to him
for advice.</p>
<p>There were, of course, differences of opinion between himself and
Putre, particularly concerning the role of religion in education. While
Putre discouraged praying in schools, Wittgenstein prayed with his
pupils every day. When Putre once remarked that he was against paying
lip-service to the Catholic faith, and considered it meaningless,
Wittgenstein replied: ’People kiss each other; that too is done with the
lips.’81</p>
<p>Despite his friendship with Putre, Wittgenstein knew within a month
that he would find it no easier at Otterthal than he had at Trattenbach.
‘It’s not going well here’, he wrote to Hänsel in October, ‘and perhaps
now my teaching career is coming to an end’:82</p>
<p>It is too difficult for me. Not one but a dozen forces are against
me, and what am I?</p>
<p>It was while at Otterthal, however, that Wittgenstein produced what
is arguably his most lasting contribution to educational reform in
Austria – a contribution that is, furthermore, fully in line with the
principles of Glöckel’s programme. That is his Wörterbuch für
Volksschulen, a spelling dictionary for use in elementary schools. The
origin of his desire to publish such a book seems to lie in his asking
Hänsel to enquire into the cost of dictionaries for use in schools. In
the letter to Hänsel quoted above, he says:</p>
<p>I had never thought the dictionaries would be so frightfully
expensive. I think, if I live long enough, I will produce a small
dictionary for elementary schools. It appears to me to be an urgent
need.</p>
<p>The need for such a dictionary was well recognized by the
authorities. There were at the time only two dictionaries available,
both of them designed for the task of teaching students to spell. One
was too big and too expensive to be used by children at the kind of
rural schools at which Wittgenstein taught. The other was too small and
badly put together, containing many foreign words which the children
were unlikely ever to use, and omitting many words commonly mis-spelt by
children. At Puchberg Wittgenstein had overcome this difficulty by
getting his pupils to produce their own dictionaries. During German
lessons and PE lessons when the weather prevented them from going
outside, Wittgenstein wrote words on the blackboard and had the children
copy them into their own vocabulary books. These vocabulary books were
then sewn together and bound with cardboard covers to produce the
finished dictionary.</p>
<p>In discussing this solution to the problem in the preface to the
published dictionary, Wittgenstein remarks:</p>
<p>He who works at the practical level is able to understand the
difficulties of this work.83 Because the result should be that each
student receives a clean and, if at all possible, correct copy of the
dictionary, and in order to reach that goal the teacher has to control
almost every word each student has written. (It is not enough to take
samples. I do not even want to talk about the demands on
discipline.)</p>
<p>Although he comments on the astonishing improvement of spelling which
resulted (‘The orthographic conscience had been awakened!’), he clearly
had no desire to repeat what had obviously been an arduous and trying
task. The Wörterbuch was envisaged as a more practical solution to the
problem, both for himself and for other teachers in the same
position.</p>
<p>In contrast to the Tractatus, the publication of the dictionary was
achieved quickly and without any great problems. In November 1924,
Wittgenstein contacted his former principal at the Lehrerbildungsanhalt,
Dr Latzke, to inform him of the plan. Latzke contacted the Viennese
publishing house of Hölder-Pichler-Tempsky, who on 13 November wrote to
Wittgenstein to say that they would be willing to publish the
dictionary. The manuscript was delivered during the Christmas vacation
of 1924, and Wittgenstein was sent the proofs the following
February.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s preface is dated 22 April 1925. In it he explains the
need for such a dictionary and the considerations that dictated the
selection of words and their arrangement. He makes clear that these
considerations are based on his own experience as a teacher. ‘No word is
too common to be entered,’ he says, ’since I have experienced that wo
has been written with the “h” that indicates a long vowel, and was with
“ss”.’84 It is clear from the preface that Wittgenstein intended his
dictionary specifically to meet the needs of elementary schools in rural
Austria. Thus, while some perfectly good German words have been omitted
because they are not used in Austria, some Austrian dialectical
expressions have been included. Dialect is also used to explain
distinctions which Wittgenstein’s experience had shown were often
confused, such as the difference between das and dass, and the
distinction between the accusative ihn and the dative ihm.</p>
<p>Before the publishers could go ahead with printing the book, they
needed assurance that it would be recommended for use in the schools for
which it was intended. They therefore submitted it for approval to the
provincial board of education for Lower Austria. The report for the
board was written by District School Inspector Eduard Buxbaum. In his
report, dated 15 May, Buxbaum agrees with Wittgenstein about the need
for such a dictionary, and goes so far as to describe this need as ‘the
most pressing question at the present time’.85 He also agrees with
Wittgenstein’s emphasis on words which belong to ‘the common everyday
vocabulary’. He finds fault, however, with Wittgenstein’s selection of
words, criticizing him for omitting such common words as Bibliothek
(library), Brücke (bridge), Buche (beech tree) etc., and also takes
exception to Wittgenstein’s preface. Dictating a dictionary to students
is, Buxbaum remarks, a strange way to control their spelling. It would
have been better, he felt, to have dictated the correct spelling of
words only after the children had used those words for themselves. He
also finds fault with Wittgenstein’s own use of the German language: ‘By
no means should the mistake of writing “eine mehrmonatliche Arbeit”
instead of saying “eine Arbeit von viele Monaten” [“a work of several
months”] creep into the German language, not even into the preface.’</p>
<p>Buxbaum concludes:</p>
<p>One can express the opinion that the dictionary will be a somewhat
useful educational tool for the upper classes of elementary schools and
of the Bürgerschulen after the cited shortcomings have been removed. It
is the opinion of the undersigned that no board of education will find
the dictionary in its present form recommendable.</p>
<p>After Wittgenstein’s preface was omitted and the words which Buxbaum
had mentioned were included, the book received its required official
approval. In November, a contract between Wittgenstein and the publisher
was drawn up, under the terms of which Wittgenstein received 10 per cent
of the wholesale price for each copy sold and ten free copies. The book
was published in 1926 and enjoyed a limited success. (It was not
reprinted, however, until 1977, by which time its interest was confined
to Wittgensteinian scholarship.)</p>
<p>As we have seen, soon after he arrived in Otterthal, Wittgenstein
became convinced that he would not for very much longer be able to
withstand the pressures of trying to teach in a hostile environment. In
February 1925 he wrote to Engelmann:</p>
<p>I suffer much from the human, or rather inhuman, beings with whom I
live – in short it is all as usual!86</p>
<p>As before, Wittgenstein found an enthusiastic response from a small
group of boys who became his favourites. These formed a special group
who stayed behind after school for extra tuition and who were known to
Wittgenstein by their Christian names. They were taken by Wittgenstein
on outings to Vienna and on walks through the local countryside, and
were educated to a standard far beyond what was expected in the kind of
rural elementary school that they attended. And, as before, their
commitment to their education, and Wittgenstein’s commitment to them,
aroused the hostility of the parents, who turned down Wittgenstein’s
suggestions that their children should continue their education at a
grammar school. Again, the girls proved more resistant to Wittgenstein’s
methods, and resented having their hair pulled and their ears boxed
because they were unable or unwilling to meet Wittgenstein’s
unrealistically high expectations, especially in mathematics.</p>
<p>In short, indeed, it was all as usual.</p>
<p>Engelmann, too, was finding life in post-war Europe difficult. Like
Wittgenstein, he felt himself to belong to an earlier epoch, but unlike
Wittgenstein, he characterized that epoch as essentially Jewish. In his
memoir, he talks of the ‘Austrian-Jewish spirit’ and of the
‘Viennese-Jewish’ culture, which was the inheritance of both himself and
Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein, as we shall see, saw it differently. But for
both, in their different ways, an awareness of their Jewishness was
heightened as the epidemic of European anti-Semitism became ever more
virulent. In Engelmann’s case, this resulted in his becoming a Zionist
and looking to the creation of Israel for a new homeland to replace the
one destroyed by the First World War. Though never at any time attracted
to Zionism (the religious associations of Palestine would always, for
him, have had more to do with the New Testament than the Old),
Wittgenstein found something to cheer in Engelmann’s desire to settle in
the Holy Land. ‘That you want to go to Palestine’, he wrote, ‘is the one
piece of news that makes your letter cheering and hopeful for me’:87</p>
<p>This may be the right thing to do and may have a spiritual effect. I
might want to join you. Would you take me with you?fn2</p>
<p>Shortly after his letter to Engelmann, Wittgenstein received,
completely unexpectedly, a letter from Eccles, his friend in Manchester,
from whom he had heard nothing since the war (unlike Pinsent, Russell
and Keynes, Eccles was not the sort to exchange friendly letters with a
member of an enemy army). Eccles’s letter was to provide the catalyst
Wittgenstein needed to persuade him to visit England. On 10 March he
replied with obvious pleasure at the renewal in contact:</p>
<p>Dear Eccles,</p>
<p>I was more than pleased to hear from you, for some reason or other I
was convinced that you either were killed in the war, or if alive, that
you would hate Germans and Austrians so much that you would have no more
intercourse with me.88</p>
<p>… I wish I could see you again before long, but when and where we can
meet God knows. Perhaps we might manage to meet during the summer
vacation, but I haven’t got much time and no money to come to England as
I have given all my money away, about 6 years ago. Last summer I should
have come to England to see a friend of mine Mr Keynes (whose name you
might know) in Cambridge. He would have paid my expenses, but I resolved
after all not to come, because I was so much afraid that the long time
and the great events (external and internal) that lie between us would
prevent us from understanding one another. However now – or at least
to-day I feel as if I might still be able to make myself understood by
my old friends and if I get any opportunity I might – w.w.p. come and
see you at Manchester.</p>
<p>In a later letter, of 7 May, he accepts Eccles’s invitation to stay
at his home in Manchester, while stressing the point that had prevented
him from staying with Keynes the previous summer (the fact that Keynes
had not actually invited him seems to have been dismissed by
Wittgenstein as irrelevant):</p>
<p>England may not have changed since 1913 but I have. However, it is no
use writing to you about that as I couldn’t explain to you the exact
nature of the change (though I perfectly understand it).89 You will see
it for yourself when I get there. I should like to come about the end of
August.</p>
<p>In July, Wittgenstein wrote to Keynes about his projected visit to
England, saying that his mind was not quite made up whether to go or
not, and hinting that the final decision depended on Keynes: ‘I should
rather like to, if I could also see you during my stay (about the middle
of August).90 Now please let me know FRANKLY if you have the slightest
wish to see me.’ Keynes evidently replied encouragingly, and even sent
Wittgenstein £10 for the journey. Before he left Wittgenstein wrote:
’I’m awfully curious how we are going to get on with one another. It
will be exactly like a dream.’91</p>
<p>Wittgenstein arrived in England on 18 August, and stayed with Keynes
in his country home in Lewes, Sussex before travelling to Manchester to
see Eccles. Despite his earlier insistence to Russell that it was better
to be good than to be clever, the experience of exchanging the company
of rural peasants for that of some of the finest minds in Europe was
delightful to him. From Lewes he wrote to Engelmann: I know that
brilliance – the riches of the spirit – is not the ultimate good, and
yet I wish now that I could die in a moment of brilliance.92</p>
<p>When he went to Manchester, both Eccles and his wife were surprised
at the great change in him. They went to the railway station to meet
him, and found in the place of the immaculately dressed young man, the
‘favourite of the ladies’ they had known before the war, a rather shabby
figure dressed in what appeared to them to be a Boy Scout uniform. The
appearance of eccentricity was compounded by Wittgenstein’s giving
Eccles the (false) impression that he had not yet seen a copy of the
Tractatus. He asked Mrs Eccles to obtain a copy, and after she had tried
in vain to buy one from the booksellers in Manchester, Eccles borrowed
one from the university library. ‘It was during this period’, Eccles
states confidently, but mistakenly, in his memoir, ’that he obtained his
first copy of the English edition of his Tractatus.’93 Evidently,
Wittgenstein very much wanted Eccles to see the book, but was too
embarrassed to admit that as the reason for their determined search.</p>
<p>At the end of his stay in England Wittgenstein went to Cambridge,
where he was finally reunited with Johnson. ‘Tell Wittgenstein’, Johnson
wrote to Keynes on 24 August, ’that I shall be very pleased to see him
once more; but I must bargain that we don’t talk on the foundations of
Logic, as I am no longer equal to having my roots dug up.’94 He also met
with Ramsey, with whom, however, it appears he quarrelled so fiercely
that the two did not resume communication until two years later.</p>
<p>Despite his argument with Ramsey, Wittgenstein’s trip was a success.
It had served the useful purpose of re-establishing contacts with old
friends – contacts he intended to make use of in the likely event that
life at Otterthal would become unbearable. ‘In case of need I shall
probably go to England’, as he put it to Engelmann.95 In letters to both
Engelmann and Eccles at the beginning of the new school term in
September, he speaks of trying once again with his ‘old job’, as though
this coming year were to be his very last attempt at teaching in rural
schools. ‘However’, he told Eccles, ‘I don’t feel so miserable now, as I
have decided to come to you if the worst came to worst, which it
certainly will sooner or later.’ In October he wrote to Keynes in
similar vein, saying he would remain a teacher, ‘as long as I feel that
the troubles into which I get that way, may do me any good’:96</p>
<p>If one has toothache it is good to put a hot-water bottle on your
face, but it will only be effective, as long as the heat of the bottle
gives you some pain. I will chuck the bottle when I find that it no
longer gives me the particular kind of pain which will do my character
any good. That is, if people here don’t turn me out before that
time.</p>
<p>‘If I leave off teaching’, he added, ‘I will probably come to England
and look for a job there, because I am convinced that I cannot find
anything at all possible in this country. In this case I will want your
help.’</p>
<p>In the event, the worst did come to the worst, and Wittgenstein had
to chuck the hot-water bottle perhaps even sooner than he had
anticipated. He left Otterthal and gave up teaching altogether very
suddenly, in April 1926. The event which precipitated this was much
talked about at the time, and was known to the villagers in Otterthal
and the surrounding area as ‘Der Vorfall Haidbauer’ (‘The Haidbauer
Case’).</p>
<p>Josef Haidbauer was an eleven-year-old pupil of Wittgenstein’s whose
father had died and whose mother worked as a live-in maid for a local
farmer named Piribauer. Haidbauer was a pale, sickly child who was to
die of leukaemia at the age of fourteen. He was not the rebellious type,
but possibly rather slow and reticent in giving answers in class. One
day, Wittgenstein’s impatience got the better of him, and he struck
Haidbauer two or three times on the head, causing the boy to collapse.
On the question of whether Wittgenstein struck the boy with undue force
– whether he ill-treated the child – a fellow pupil, August Riegler, has
(with dubious logic) commented:</p>
<p>It cannot be said that Wittgenstein ill-treated the child.97 If
Haidbauer’s punishment was ill-treatment, then 80 per cent of
Wittgenstein’s punishments were ill-treatments.</p>
<p>On seeing the boy collapse, Wittgenstein panicked. He sent his class
home, carried the boy to the headmaster’s room to await attention from
the local doctor (who was based in nearby Kirchberg) and then hurriedly
left the school.</p>
<p>On his way out he had the misfortune to run into Herr Piribauer, who,
it seems, had been sent for by one of the children. Piribauer is
remembered in the village as a quarrelsome man who harboured a
deep-seated grudge against Wittgenstein. His own daughter, Hermine, had
often been on the wrong side of Wittgenstein’s temper, and had once been
hit so hard that she bled behind the ears. Piribauer recalls that when
he met Wittgenstein in the corridor, he had worked himself up into a
fierce rage: ‘I called him all the names under the sun. I told him he
wasn’t a teacher, he was an animal-trainer! And that I was going to
fetch the police right away!’ Piribauer hurried to the police station to
have Wittgenstein arrested, but was frustrated to find that the single
officer who manned the station was away.98 The following day he renewed
the attempt, but was informed by the headmaster that Wittgenstein had
disappeared in the night.</p>
<p>On 28 April 1926 Wittgenstein handed in his resignation to Wilhelm
Kundt, one of the District School Inspectors. Kundt had, naturally, been
told of the ‘Haidbauer Case’, but reassured Wittgenstein that nothing
much would come of it. Kundt placed great value on Wittgenstein’s
ability as a teacher, and did not want to lose him. He advised him to
take a holiday to calm his nerves, and then to decide whether he really
wished to give up teaching. Wittgenstein, however, was resolute. Nothing
would persuade him to stay on. At the hearing which followed, he was, as
Kundt had anticipated, cleared of misconduct. But he had, by then,
despaired of accomplishing anything more as a teacher in the Austrian
countryside.</p>
<p>The Haidbauer incident was not, of course, the cause of this despair,
but simply the event that finally triggered its inevitable culmination
in Wittgenstein’s resignation. The despair itself had deeper roots.
Shortly before the incident, Wittgenstein had met August Wolf, an
applicant for the post of headmaster at Otterthal, and had told him:</p>
<p>I can only advise you to withdraw your application.99 The people here
are so narrow-minded that nothing can be achieved.</p>
<p>fn1 This connects also with a dream quoted by Bartley (from where we
do not know), which he says came to Wittgenstein ‘possibly in early
December 1920’. The dream is as follows:</p>
<p>I was a priest. In the front hall of my house there was an altar; to
the right of the altar a stairway led off.14 It was a grand stairway
carpeted in red, rather like that at the Alleegasse. At the foot of the
altar, and partly covering it, was an oriental carpet. And certain other
religious objects and regalia were placed on and beside the altar. One
of these was a rod of precious metal.</p>
<p>But a theft had occurred. A thief entered from the left and stole the
rod. This had to be reported to the police, who sent a representative
who wanted a description of the rod. For instance, of what sort of metal
was it made? I could not say; I could not even say whether it was of
silver or of gold. The police officer questioned whether the rod had
ever existed in the first place. I then began to examine the other parts
and fittings of the altar and noticed that the carpet was a prayer rug.
My eyes began to focus on the border of the rug. The border was lighter
in colour than the beautiful centre. In a curious way it seemed to be
faded. It was, nonetheless, still strong and firm.</p>
<p>This is the part of Bartley’s book that most strongly indicates that
in writing it he had access to a manuscript of Wittgenstein’s. Bartley
not only quotes the dream as though it were described by Wittgenstein
himself; he also gives interpretations of it suggested by both
Wittgenstein and ‘some other party, possibly Hänsel’. Furthermore,
unlike the ‘Prater episodes’, Bartley’s information – the content of the
dream, its timing, and even the interpretations given of it by Hänsel
and Wittgenstein – connects plausibly with information from other
sources. Bartley even gives us Wittgenstein’s reaction to Hänsel’s
interpretation (which connects the symbolism of the dream to images
taken from the Old Testament):</p>
<p>It puzzled Wittgenstein to think that if such an interpretation were
to be attached to the dream, it would be his dream.15</p>
<p>This reaction, too, is very plausible. According to Bartley,
Wittgenstein himself was inclined to interpret the dream in alchemical
terms. The rod is at once a phallic symbol (his ‘base self’) and a
symbol of alchemical transformation (the base metal changing into gold
or silver), a transformation of which Wittgenstein is unable to convince
his conscience, represented by the doubting police.</p>
<p>Thus, if we may be allowed to conflate Wittgenstein’s letter to
Engelmann, Hänsel’s reminiscence and the dream quoted by Bartley, we
arrive at a convincing account of the profound change in his
temperamental state that is evident during the Christmas holiday period
of 1921. Because he could not convince himself that the transformation
in himself that he so desired could actually take place, he refused to
follow what he regarded as a call to become a priest. The refusal could
be explained only by a ‘fundamental deficiency’, for otherwise the
longed-for transformation would surely be possible. He really was base
metal; he had to remain stuck on earth.</p>
<p>fn2 Engelmann eventually left Europe for Tel Aviv in 1934 and
remained there (after 1948 as an Israeli citizen) until his death in
1963. Nothing more was mentioned of the idea that Wittgenstein should
join him.</p>
