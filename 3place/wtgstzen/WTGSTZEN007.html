<h4 id="russells-master">4 RUSSELL’S MASTER</h4>
<p>If we now turn to the gifted men, we shall see that in their case
love frequently begins with self-mortification, humiliation, and
restraint. A moral change sets in, a process of purification seems to
emanate from the object loved.</p>
<p>Weininger, Sex and Character</p>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN RETURNED TO Cambridge from his holiday with Pinsent in
an agitated and irritable state. Within days, he had his first major
disagreement with Russell. In Wittgenstein’s absence, Russell had
published a paper on ‘The Essence of Religion’ in the Hibbert Journal.
It was taken from his abandoned book, Prisons, and was an
Ottoline-inspired attempt to present a ‘Religion of Contemplation’
centred on the notion of ‘the infinite part of our life’, which ‘does
not see the world from one point of view: it shines impartially, like
the diffused light on a cloudy sea’:1</p>
<p>Unlike the finite life, it is impartial; its impartiality leads to
truth in thought, justice in action, and universal love in feeling.</p>
<p>In many ways the article anticipates the mystical doctrines that
Wittgenstein himself was to advance in the Tractatus, particularly in
its advocation of a Spinozistic ‘freedom from the finite self’ (what in
the Tractatus is called contemplating the world sub specie aeterni) and
in its repudiation of what Russell calls: ‘the insistent demand that our
ideals shall be already realized in the world’ (compare TLP 6.41).
Nevertheless, unlike the Tractatus, Russell’s paper shows no hesitation
in articulating this mysticism, and in, for example, using words like
‘finite’ and ‘infinite’ in ways that are, strictly speaking,
meaningless. In any case, Wittgenstein hated the article and, within
days of being back at Cambridge, stormed into Russell’s rooms to make
his feelings known. He happened to interrupt a letter to Ottoline:</p>
<p>Here is Wittgenstein just arrived, frightfully pained by my Hibbert
article which he evidently detests.2 I must stop because of him.</p>
<p>A few days later Russell spelt out the reasons for Wittgenstein’s
outburst: ‘He felt I had been a traitor to the gospel of exactness; also
that such things are too intimate for print.’ ‘I minded very much’, he
added, ‘because I half agree with him.’ He continued to brood on the
attack for a few more days:3</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s criticisms disturbed me profoundly. He was so unhappy,
so gentle, so wounded in his wish to think well of me.4</p>
<p>He minded all the more because of his increasing tendency to look
upon Wittgenstein as his natural successor. His own endeavours in the
analysis of logic were becoming ever more half-hearted. Having prepared
the first draft of a paper entitled ‘What is Logic?’ he found he
couldn’t get on with it and felt ‘very much inclined to leave it to
Wittgenstein’.5</p>
<p>Moore, too, felt the force of Wittgenstein’s forthright criticism
during these first few weeks of October. Wittgenstein began the term by
attending Moore’s lectures on psychology. ‘He was very displeased with
them’, writes Moore, ‘because I was spending a great deal of time in
discussing Ward’s view that psychology did not differ from the Natural
Sciences in subject-matter but only in point of view’:6</p>
<p>He told me these lectures were very bad – that what I ought to do was
to say what I thought, not to discuss what other people thought; and he
came no more to my lectures.</p>
<p>Moore adds: ‘In this year both he and I were still attending
Russell’s Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics; but W. used also
to go for hours to Russell’s rooms in the evening to discuss Logic with
him.’ In fact, Wittgenstein – apparently undergoing the process of
self-mortification and moral change described by Weininger – would spend
these hours discussing himself as much as logic. He would, according to
Russell, ‘pace up and down my room like a wild beast for three hours in
agitated silence’. Once, Russell asked: ‘Are you thinking about logic or
your sins?’ ‘Both’, Wittgenstein replied, and continued his pacing.7</p>
<p>Russell considered him to be on the verge of a nervous breakdown –
‘not far removed from suicide, feeling himself a miserable creature,
full of sin’8 – and was inclined to attribute this nervous fatigue to
the fact that: ‘he strains his mind to the utmost constantly, at things
which are discouraging by their difficulty’.9 He was supported in this
view by a doctor who, so concerned was Wittgenstein about his fits of
dizziness and his inability to work, was called and who pronounced: ‘It
is all nerves.’ Despite Wittgenstein’s earnest desire to be treated
morally, therefore, Russell insisted on treating him physically,
advising him to eat better and to go out riding. Ottoline did her bit by
sending some cocoa. ‘I will remember the directions’, Russell promised
her, ’andandandand try to get W. to use it – but I’m sure he
won’t.’10</p>
<p>Wittgenstein did, however, take Russell’s advice to go riding. Once
or twice a week for the rest of term he and Pinsent would hire horses
and take them for what Pinsent regarded as ‘tame’ rides (i.e. rides that
involved no jumping) along the river tow-path to Clay-hithe, or along
the Trumpington road to Grantchester. If this produced any effect on
Wittgenstein’s temperament at all, it did not make him any the less
inclined to sudden outbursts of wrath against the moral failings of
himself and others.</p>
<p>On 9 November, Russell had arranged to take a walk with Wittgenstein.
On the same day, however, he felt obliged to watch Whitehead’s son,
North, compete in a rowing race on the river. He therefore took
Wittgenstein to the river, where they both watched North get beaten in
his race. This led to, as Russell put it, a ‘passionate afternoon’. He
himself found the ‘excitement and conventional importance’ of the race
painful, the more so because North ‘minded being beaten horribly’.11 But
Wittgenstein found the whole affair disgusting:</p>
<p>… said we might as well have looked on at a bull fight (I had that
feeling myself), and that all was of the devil, and so on. I was cross
North had been beaten, so I explained the necessity of competition with
patient lucidity. At last we got on to other topics, and I thought it
was all right, but he suddenly stood still and explained that the way we
had spent the afternoon was so vile that we ought not to live, or at
least he ought not, that nothing is tolerable except producing great
works or enjoying those of others, that he has accomplished nothing and
never will, etc. – all this with a force that nearly knocks one down. He
makes me feel like a bleating lambkin.</p>
<p>A few days later, Russell had had enough: ‘I told Wittgenstein
yesterday that he thinks too much about himself, and if he begins again
I shall refuse to listen unless I think he is quite desperate.12 He has
talked it out now as much as is good for him.’</p>
<p>And yet, at the end of November, we find him drawn once more into a
discussion with Wittgenstein about Wittgenstein:</p>
<p>I got into talking about his faults – he is worried by his
unpopularity and asked me why it was. It was a long and difficult and
passionate (on his side) conversation lasting till 1.30, so I am rather
short of sleep.13 He is a great task but quite worth it. He is a little
too simple, yet I am afraid of spoiling some fine quality if I say too
much to make him less so.</p>
<p>Something of what Russell means by Wittgenstein’s being ‘a little too
simple’ (and also, perhaps, of the source of his supposed unpopularity)
we can gather from an entry in Pinsent’s diary. On the evening following
Wittgenstein’s ‘passionate afternoon’ on the river, he and Pinsent
attended a concert at the Cambridge University Music Club, and
afterwards went to Wittgenstein’s rooms. Farmer, the undergraduate monk
mentioned earlier by Russell, appeared. He was, says Pinsent, ‘a man
Wittgenstein dislikes and believes to be dishonest minded’:14</p>
<p>… [Wittgenstein] got very excited trying to induce him to read some
good book on some exact science, and see what honest thought is. Which
would obviously be good for Farmer – as indeed for any one – : but
Wittgenstein was very overbearing and let Farmer know exactly what he
thought of him, and altogether talked as if he was his Director of
Studies! Farmer took it very well – obviously convinced that
Wittgenstein is a lunatic.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s conviction that he was unpopular needs some
qualification. During this term, at the very peak of his nervous
irritability, he did succeed in making some new and important
friendships. In particular, he gained the respect and affection of John
Maynard Keynes, who was to be a valuable and supportive friend for the
greater part of Wittgenstein’s life. Russell first brought the two
together on 31 October – ‘but it was a failure’, he reports,
‘Wittgenstein was too ill to argue properly’.15 But by 12 November we
find Keynes writing to Duncan Grant: ’Wittgenstein is a most wonderful
character – what I said about him when I saw you last is quite untrue –
and extraordinarily nice. I like enormously to be with him.’16</p>
<p>Keynes’s advocacy was powerful enough to overcome any doubts Lytton
Strachey may still have had about Wittgenstein’s suitability for
membership of the Apostles, and, after his pronouncement of
Wittgenstein’s genius, the issue was decided. The only remaining doubt
was whether Wittgenstein would wish to become a member – whether he
really considered it worth his while to meet regularly for discussions
with the other members. This, from an Apostolic point of view, was quite
extraordinary. ‘Have you heard’, wrote Keynes in astonishment to
Strachey, ’how our new brother’s only objection to the Society is that
it doesn’t happen to be apostolic?’17</p>
<p>Russell, with some misgivings, did his best to further the cause.
‘Obviously’, he wrote to Keynes:18</p>
<p>from [Wittgenstein’s] point of view the Society is a mere waste of
time. But perhaps from a philanthropic point of view he might be made to
feel it worth going on with.</p>
<p>Thus, ‘philanthropically’, he did what he could to present the
Society in a favourable light. He explained to Wittgenstein that, though
there was nothing to be got out of the Society in its present state, in
former days it had been good and might be again if he were prepared to
stick to it. As we have seen, Russell’s own objections to the Society
centred on their predilection for homosexual ‘intrigues’. Wittgenstein’s
doubts, however, were to do with the fact that, though he liked the
‘angels’ (graduates) in the Society (Moore, Russell and Keynes, in
particular), he had taken a fierce dislike to his fellow ‘brothers’ –
the undergraduate members – and was uncertain whether he could stand the
prospect of regular discussions with them. He objected to their
immaturity, telling Keynes that to watch them at Apostolic meetings was
to see those who had not yet made their toilets – a process which,
though necessary, was indecent to observe.</p>
<p>The ‘brothers’ in question were Frank Bliss, who had come from Rugby
to read classics at King’s, and Ferenc Békássy, an aristocratic
Hungarian who had been at Bedales before coming to King’s. Both were
involved in the intrigues that Russell objected to, particularly
Békássy, who, it is reported by James Strachey, filled Keynes and Gerald
Shove with such lust at his first meeting with the Apostles that they
wanted to ‘take him’ right then and there on the ritual hearthrug.19 It
can hardly have been their involvement in such affairs that made
Wittgenstein object to them: otherwise, it would be quite inexplicable
that he took no exception to Keynes. His dislike for Békássy may perhaps
have had something in it of Austro-Hungarian rivalry. But it was
principally Bliss that he objected to – ‘He can’t stand him’, Russell
told Ottoline.20</p>
<p>With great hesitation and doubt, therefore, Wittgenstein accepted
membership and attended his first Saturday meeting on 16 November. At
the meeting Moore read a paper on religious conversion and Wittgenstein
contributed to the discussion his view that, so far as he knew,
religious experience consisted in getting rid of worry (the Sorge that
he had mentioned to Russell) and had the consequence of giving one the
courage not to care what might happen (for, to someone with faith,
nothing could happen). After the meeting Lytton Strachey was optimistic
about the future of the Society, finding the prospect of conflict and
bitchiness offered by the new members ‘particularly exhilarating’:</p>
<p>Our brothers B[liss] and Wittgenstein are so nasty and our brother
Békássy is so nice that the Society ought to rush forward now into the
most progressive waters.21 I looked in on B[liss] on Sunday night and he
seemed quite as nasty as Rupert [Brooke] ever was.</p>
<p>On the same day he wrote at length to Sydney Saxon Turner about
Russell’s objections to Wittgenstein’s membership:</p>
<p>The poor man is in a sad state. He looks about 96 – with long
snow-white hair and an infinitely haggard countenance.22 The election of
Wittgenstein has been a great blow to him. He dearly hoped to keep him
all to himself, and indeed succeeded wonderfully, until Keynes insisted
on meeting him, and saw at once that he was a genius and that it was
essential to elect him. The other people (after a slight wobble from
Békássy) also became violently in favour. Their decision was suddenly
announced to Bertie, who nearly swooned. Of course he could produce no
reason against the election – except the remarkable one that the Society
was so degraded that his Austrian would certainly refuse to belong to
it. He worked himself up into such a frenzy over this that no doubt he
got himself into a state of believing it – but it wasn’t any good.
Wittgenstein shows no signs of objecting to the Society, though he
detests Bliss, who in return loathes him. I think on the whole the
prospects are of the brightest. Békássy is such a pleasant fellow that,
while he is in love with Bliss, he yet manages to love Wittgenstein. The
three of them ought to manage very well, I think. Bertie is really a
tragic figure, and I am very sorry for him; but he is most deluded
too.</p>
<p>Strachey was wrong on several counts. Russell had no desire to ‘keep
Wittgenstein all to himself’; he would have been only too glad to be
spared the evening-long examinations of Wittgenstein’s ‘sins’, to which
he had been subjected all term. His doubts about the wisdom of electing
Wittgenstein to the Apostles – apart from his own disapproval of their
homosexuality – had to do chiefly with his feeling that it would ‘lead
to some kind of disaster’. And in this he was not, as Strachey thought,
deluded.</p>
<p>At the beginning of December, Strachey was told by his brother James
that: ‘The Witter-Gitter man is trembling on the verge of resignation.’
Prompted by Moore, Strachey came up to Cambridge to try and persuade
Wittgenstein to stay on, but, even after several meetings with both
Wittgenstein and Moore, he was unable to do so.23 At the end of term
Russell reported to Ottoline:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein has left the Society. I think he is right, tho’ loyalty
to the Society wd.24 not have led me to say so beforehand.</p>
<p>He added, in terms which suggest he was very far indeed from wanting
to keep Wittgenstein all to himself:</p>
<p>I have had to cope with him a good deal. It is really a relief to
think of not seeing him for some time, tho’ I feel it is horrid of me to
feel that.</p>
<p>To ‘Goldie’ Lowes Dickenson, Russell repeated his opinion that
Wittgenstein had been right to leave, and added that he had tried to
dissuade him: ’He is much the most apostolic and the ablest person I
have come across since Moore.’25</p>
<p>Evidence for the nature of Wittgenstein’s work during this Michaelmas
term is scanty. On 25 October Pinsent records a visit from Wittgenstein
during which he announces a new solution to a problem – ‘In the most
fundamental Symbolic Logic’ – which had puzzled him greatly in Iceland,
and to which he had then made only a makeshift solution:</p>
<p>His latest is quite different and covers more ground, and if sound
should revolutionise lots of Symbolic Logic: Russell, he says, thinks it
sound, but says nobody will understand it: I think I comprehend it
myself however (!).26 If Wittgenstein’s solution works, he will be the
first to solve a problem which has puzzled Russell and Frege for some
years: it is the most masterly and convincing solution too.</p>
<p>From this we can reconstruct neither the problem nor the solution,
although it seems quite likely that it had to do with Wittgenstein’s
remark to Russell during the summer that: ‘our problems can be traced
down to the atomic prop[osition]s’. Towards the end of term Wittgenstein
gave a paper to the Moral Science Club, the philosophy society at
Cambridge, which can perhaps be seen as an expansion of this remark.
Wittgenstein had played a great part in the discussions of the club
during this term, and with Moore’s help had persuaded them to adopt a
new set of rules, requiring a Chairman to be appointed with the duty of
preventing the discussion from becoming futile, and stipulating that no
paper should last longer than seven minutes. Wittgenstein’s own paper
was one of the first to be given under these new rules. On 29 November
the minutes record:</p>
<p>Mr Wittgenstein read a paper entitled ‘What is Philosophy?’ The paper
lasted only about 4 minutes, thus cutting the previous record
established by Mr Tye by nearly two minutes.27 Philosophy was defined as
all those primitive propositions which are assumed as true without proof
by the various sciences. This defn. was much discussed, but there was no
general disposition to adopt it. The discussion kept very well to the
point, and the Chairman did not find it necessary to intervene much.</p>
<p>After term, on his way back to Vienna, Wittgenstein called on Frege
at Jena, and had a long discussion with him, so he told Russell, ‘about
our Theory of Symbolism of which, I think, he understood the general
outline’. His letters to Russell during January show him to be concerned
with ‘the Complex Problem’ – the question of what corresponds to an
atomic proposition if it is true.28 Suppose, for example, ‘Socrates is
mortal’ is such a proposition: is the fact which corresponds to it a
‘complex’ made up of the two ‘things’, Socrates and mortality? This view
would require the Platonic assumption of the objective existence of
forms – the assumption that there exists, not only individuals, but also
abstract entities such as mortality. Such an assumption is, of course,
made by Russell in his Theory of Types, with which Wittgenstein became
increasingly dissatisfied.</p>
<p>During the vacation this dissatisfaction led to his announcement of
one of the central conceptions of his new logic. ‘I think that there
cannot be different Types of things!’ he wrote to Russell:29</p>
<p>… every theory of types must be rendered superfluous by a proper
theory of symbolism: For instance if I analyse the prop[osition]
Socrates is mortal into Socrates, Mortality and (Ex, y)el(x,y) I want a
theory of types to tell me that ‘Mortality is Socrates’ is nonsensical,
because if I treat ‘Mortality’ as a proper name (as I did) there is
nothing to prevent me to make the substitution the wrong way round. But
if I analyse [it] (as I do now) into Socrates and (Ex) x is mortal or
generally into x and (Ex) (x) it becomes impossible to substitute the
wrong way round, because the two symbols are now of a different kind
themselves.</p>
<p>He told Russell that he was not quite certain that his present way of
analysing ‘Socrates is mortal’ was correct. But on one point he was most
certain: ‘all theory of types must be done away with by a theory of
symbolism showing that what seem to be different kinds of things are
symbolised by different kinds of symbols which cannot possibly be
substituted in one another’s places’.</p>
<p>In the face of such a sweeping dismissal of his theory, Russell might
have been expected to present a spirited defence of his position – or at
least some tough questions as to how his logicist foundations of
mathematics might avoid contradiction without a theory of types. But he
had by this time abandoned logic almost entirely. He spent the vacation
working on quite a different subject – the existence of matter. He had,
in November, delivered a paper to the Moral Science Club on the subject,
in which he reiterated the view expressed in Cardiff earlier in the year
that: ‘No good argument for or against the existence of matter has yet
been brought forward’, and posed the question: ‘Can we, therefore, know
an object satisfying the hypotheses of physics from our private
sense-data?’ During the vacation he sketched an outline of the way in
which he proposed to treat the problem:30</p>
<p>Physics exhibits sensations as functions of physical objects.31</p>
<p>But epistemology demands that physical objects should be exhibited as
functions of sensations.</p>
<p>Thus we have to solve the equations giving sensations in terms of
physical objects, so as to make them give physical objects in terms of
sensations.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>
<p>‘I am sure I have hit upon a real thing’, he told Ottoline, ‘which is
very likely to occupy me for years to come.’32 It would require ‘a
combination of physics, psychology, andandandand mathematical logic’,
and even the creation of ‘a whole new science’. In the letter of January
1913, Wittgenstein was faintly dismissive of the whole project: ‘I
cannot imagine your way of working from sense-data forward.’</p>
<p>By the beginning of 1913, then, we see Russell and Wittgenstein
working on very different projects – Russell on the creation of his ‘new
science’, and Wittgenstein on the analysis of logic. Russell was now
fully prepared to accept the latter as Wittgenstein’s field rather than
his own.</p>
<p>The new basis of their relationship was detected by Pinsent, who near
the beginning of term describes an occasion when he and Wittgenstein
were together in his rooms:</p>
<p>Then Russell appeared – to inform me of some alterations he is making
in the hours of his lectures – and he and Wittgenstein got talking – the
latter explaining one of his latest discoveries in the Fundamentals of
Logic – a discovery which, I gather, only occurred to him this morning,
and which appears to be quite important and was very interesting.33
Russell acquiesced in what he said without a murmur.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks after this, upon being convicted by Wittgenstein
that some of the early proofs in Principia were very inexact, Russell
commented to Ottoline: ‘fortunately it is his business to put them
right, not mine’.34</p>
<p>The co-operation between the two had come to an end. In the field of
logic, Wittgenstein, far from being Russell’s student, had become his
teacher.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was late returning for the start of term owing to his
father’s long-expected death from the cancer he had suffered with for
over two years. The end, when it came, was something of a relief. On 21
January he wrote to Russell:</p>
<p>My dear father died yesterday in the afternoon. He had the most
beautiful death that I can imagine; without the slightest pains and
falling asleep like a child! I did not feel sad for a single moment
during all the last hours, but most joyful and I think that this death
was worth a whole life.35</p>
<p>He finally arrived in Cambridge on 27 January, going straight to
Pinsent’s rooms. About a week later Pinsent records an argument that
shows yet another facet of the differences between Russell and
Wittgenstein. In 1907 Russell had stood as a parliamentary candidate for
the Women’s Suffrage Party. Perhaps prompted by this fact (they had just
returned from one of Russell’s lectures), Wittgenstein and Pinsent got
into an argument about women’s suffrage. Wittgenstein was ‘very much
against it’:36</p>
<p>… for no particular reason except that ‘all the women he knows are
such idiots’. He said that at Manchester University the girl students
spend all their time flirting with the professors. Which disgusts him
very much – as he dislikes half measures of all sorts, and disapproves
of anything not deadly in earnest.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s work on logic did nothing, apparently, to improve the
rigour of his thought on political questions.</p>
<p>It is perhaps this inability – or, more likely, unwillingness – to
bring his analytical powers to bear on questions of public concern that
prompted Russell to criticize Wittgenstein for being ‘in danger of
becoming narrow and uncivilised’. Russell suggested as a corrective some
French prose – a suggestion that involved him in a ‘terrific
contest’:37</p>
<p>He raged andandandand stormed, andandandand I irritated him more
andandandand more by merely smiling. We made it up in the end, but he
remained quite unconvinced. The things I say to him are just the things
you would say to me if you were not afraid of the avalanche they wd.
produce – andandandand his avalanche is just what mine wd. be! I feel
his lack of civilisation andandandand suffer from it – it is odd how
little music does to civilise people – it is too apart, too passionate
andandandand too remote from words. He has not a sufficiently wide
curiosity or a sufficient wish for a broad survey of the world. It won’t
spoil his work on logic, but it will make him always a very narrow
specialist, andandandand rather too much the champion of a party – that
is, when judged by the highest standards.</p>
<p>As the comparisons to his own situation with Ottoline indicate,
Russell was bemused to find himself in the position of one advocating
synthesis rather than analysis. But it should be remembered that even
his philosophical preoccupations at this time were moving in that
direction – away from the ‘narrowness’ of logical analysis and towards a
broader synthesis of physics, psychology and mathematics. In
consequence, his discussions with Wittgenstein became, for him,
frustratingly one-sided:</p>
<p>I find I no longer talk to him about my work, but only about his.38
When there are no clear arguments, but only inconclusive considerations
to be balanced, or unsatisfactory points of view to be set against each
other, he is no good; and he treats infant theories with a ferocity
which they can only endure when they are grown up. The result is that I
become completely reserved, even about work.</p>
<p>As the wearer of Russell’s mantle in logic (it is hard to remember
that Wittgenstein was still only twenty-four, and officially an
undergraduate reading for a BA), Wittgenstein was asked to review a
textbook on logic – The Science of Logic by P. Coffey – for the
Cambridge Review. This is the only book review he ever published, and
the first published record of his philosophical opinions. In it he
presents a Russellian dismissal of the Aristotelian logic advanced by
Coffey, but expresses himself with a stridency that exceeds even
Russell’s, and borders on the vitriolic:</p>
<p>In no branch of learning can an author disregard the results of
honest research with so much impunity as he can in Philosophy and Logic.
To this circumstance we owe the publication of such a book as Mr
Coffey’s ‘Science of Logic’: and only as a typical example of the work
of many logicians of to-day does this book deserve consideration. The
author’s Logic is that of the scholastic philosophers and he makes all
their mistakes – of course with the usual references to Aristotle.
(Aristotle, whose name is so much taken in vain by our logicians, would
turn in his grave if he knew that so many Logicians know no more about
Logic to-day than he did 2,000 years ago.) The author has not taken the
slightest notice of the great work of the modern mathematical logicians
– work which has brought about an advance in Logic comparable only to
that which made Astronomy out of Astrology, and Chemistry out of
Alchemy.</p>
<p>Mr Coffey, like many logicians, draws a great advantage from an
unclear way of expressing himself; for if you cannot tell whether he
means to say ‘Yes’ or ‘No’, it is difficult to argue against him.
However, even through his foggy expression, many grave mistakes can be
recognised clearly enough; and I propose to give a list of some of the
most striking ones, and would advise the student of Logic to trace these
mistakes and their consequences in other books on Logic also.</p>
<p>There follows a list of such mistakes, which are, for the most part,
the weaknesses of traditional (Aristotelian) logic customarily pointed
out by adherents of Russellian mathematical logic – for instance, that
it assumes all propositions to be of the subject-predicate form, that it
confuses the copula ‘is’ (as in ‘Socrates is mortal’) with the ‘is’ of
identity (‘Twice two is four’), and so on. ‘The worst of such books as
this’, the review concludes, ‘is that they prejudice sensible people
against the study of Logic.’</p>
<p>By ‘sensible people’ Wittgenstein presumably meant people with some
sort of training in mathematics and the sciences, as opposed to the
classical training we can probably assume Mr Coffey (along with most
traditional logicians) to have had. In this he was echoing a view held
by Russell and expressed to Ottoline the previous December:</p>
<p>I believe a certain sort of mathematicians have far more
philosophical capacity than most people who take up philosophy.39
Hitherto the people attracted to philosophy have been mostly those who
loved the big generalizations, which were all wrong, so that few people
with exact minds have taken up the subject. It has long been one of my
dreams to found a great school of mathematically-minded philosophers,
but I don’t know whether I shall ever get it accomplished. I had hopes
of Norton, but he has not the physique, Broad is all right, but has no
fundamental originality. Wittgenstein of course is exactly my dream.</p>
<p>As we have seen, during the Lent term Russell somewhat modified this
view: Wittgenstein was exact, but narrow. He had too little ‘wish for a
broad survey of the world’, insisted on too great a degree of exactness
from infant theories, showed too little patience with ‘inconclusive
considerations’ and ‘unsatisfactory points of view’. Perhaps, faced with
Wittgenstein’s single-mindedness, Russell came to think that a love of
the big generalizations was not such a bad thing after all.</p>
<p>For Wittgenstein, his absorption in logical problems was complete.
They were not a part of his life, but the whole of it. Thus, when during
the Easter vacation he found himself temporarily bereft of inspiration,
he was plunged into despair. On 25 March he wrote to Russell describing
himself as ‘perfectly sterile’ and doubting whether he would ever gain
new ideas:</p>
<p>Whenever I try to think about Logic, my thoughts are so vague that
nothing ever can crystallize out. What I feel is the curse of all those
who have only half a talent; it is like a man who leads you along a dark
corridor with a light and just when you are in the middle of it the
light goes out and you are left alone.40</p>
<p>‘Poor wretch!’ Russell commented to Ottoline.41 ‘I know his feelings
so well. It is an awful curse to have the creative impulse unless you
have a talent that can always be relied on, like Shakespeare’s or
Mozart’s.’</p>
<p>The responsibility Wittgenstein had been given by Russell – for the
‘next great advance in philosophy’ – was a source of both pride and
suffering. He assumed it with complete and utter seriousness. He assumed
also the role of a kind of custodian in the field of Russellian
mathematical logic. Thus, when Frege wrote to Jourdain telling him about
his plans to work at the theory of irrational numbers, we find Jourdain
ticking him off in Wittgenstein’s name:</p>
<p>Do you mean that you are writing a third volume of the Grundgesetze
der Arithmetik? Wittgenstein and I were rather disturbed to think that
you might be doing so, because the theory of irrational numbers – unless
you have got quite a new theory of them – would seem to require that the
contradiction has been previously avoided; and the part dealing with
irrational numbers on the new basis has been splendidly worked out by
Russell and Whitehead in their Principia Mathematica.42</p>
<p>Wittgenstein returned from the Easter vacation in, according to
Russell, a ‘shocking state – always gloomy, pacing up and down, waking
out of a dream when one speaks to him’.43 He told Russell that logic was
driving him mad. Russell was inclined to agree: ‘I think there is a
danger of it, so I urged him to let it alone for a bit and do other
work.’</p>
<p>There is no record of Wittgenstein’s doing any other work during this
period – only of his taking up, albeit briefly, an unexpected pastime.
On 29 April Pinsent notes: ‘I played tennis with Wittgenstein: he has
never played the game before, and I am trying to teach him: so it was a
rather slow game!’44 However, a week later: ‘I had tea chez:
Wittgenstein, and at 5.0, we went up to the “New Field” and played
tennis.45 He was off his game today and eventually got sick of it and
stopped in the middle of a game.’ And that is the last we hear of
tennis.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein came to think that what he needed was not a diversion,
but greater powers of concentration. To this end he was prepared to try
anything, even hypnosis, and had himself mesmerized by a Dr Rogers. ‘The
idea is this’, writes Pinsent in his diary: ’It is, I believe, true that
people are capable of special muscular effort while under hypnotic
trance: then why not also special mental effort?’46</p>
<p>So when he is under trance, Rogers is to ask him certain questions
about points of Logic, about which Wittgenstein is not yet clear, (–
certain uncertainties which no one has yet succeeded in clearing up):
and Witt: hopes he will then be able to see clearly. It sounds a wild
scheme! Witt: has been twice to be hypnotised – but not until the end of
the second interview did Rogers succeed in sending him to sleep: when he
did, however, he did it so thoroughly that it took ½ hour to wake him up
again completely. Witt: says he was conscious all the time – could hear
Rogers talk – but absolutely without will or strength: could not
comprehend what was said to him – could exert no muscular effort – felt
exactly as if he were under anaesthetic. He felt very drousy for an hour
after he left Rogers. It is altogether a wonderful business.</p>
<p>Wonderful it may have been; useful it was not.</p>
<p>Russell, apparently, knew nothing about the scheme (it would surely
have made too good a story to omit from his many recorded reminiscences
of Wittgenstein if he had known of it); by this time, Pinsent was the
more trusted confidant. At one of Russell’s ‘squashes’ they are
described as ‘talking to each other and ignoring the rest of the
world’.47 Pinsent was, perhaps, the only person with whom Wittgenstein
could relax, and, temporarily at least, take his mind off logic. With
Pinsent, Wittgenstein found himself able to enjoy some of the
recreations customary for Cambridge undergraduates – riding, playing
tennis, and even, on occasion, ‘messing about on the river’:</p>
<p>… went on the river with Wittgenstein in a canoo.48 We went up to
‘the Orchard’ at Grantchester, where we had lunch. Wittgenstein was in
one of his sulky moods at first, but he woke up suddenly (as always
happens with him) after lunch. Then we went on above Byron’s pool and
there bathed. We had no towels or bathing draws, but it was great
fun.</p>
<p>Their strongest common bond, however, was music. Pinsent’s diary
records innumerable concerts at the Cambridge University Music Club, and
also times when they would make music together, Wittgenstein whistling
the vocal parts of Schubert’s songs while Pinsent accompanied him on the
piano. They had the same taste in music – Beethoven, Brahms, Mozart, and
above all Schubert. Wittgenstein also seems to have tried to arouse
interest in Labor, and Pinsent tells of an occasion when Wittgenstein
tried to get a Labor quintet performed at Cambridge. They shared, too, a
distaste for what Pinsent describes as ‘modern music’. Thus:</p>
<p>… we went to the C.U.M.C., and found Lindley there … he and
Wittgenstein got arguing about modern music, which was rather amusing.49
Lindley used not to like modern stuff, but he has been corrupted! These
performers always do in the end. [30.11.12]</p>
<p>Wittgenstein and Lindley came to tea: there was a lot of animated
discussion about modern music – Lindley defending it against us two.50
[28.2.13]</p>
<p>I came with him to his rooms. Soon afterwards one Mac’Clure turned up
– a musical undergraduate – and there was a wild discussion on modern
music – Mac’Clure against Witt: and myself.51 [24.5.13]</p>
<p>And so on. Music did not have to be very modern to be deprecated by
Wittgenstein, and these entries are just as likely to refer to
conversations about, say, Mahler, as Schönberg. Labor aside, neither
Wittgenstein nor Pinsent are on record as admiring anything after
Brahms.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein asked Pinsent to accompany him on another holiday, this
time in Spain, again to be paid for by Wittgenstein, an offer which
Pinsent’s mother told him was ‘too good to refuse’. No doubt intrigued
by the munificence of their son’s friend, Pinsent’s parents were taken
to tea at Wittgenstein’s rooms. It was an occasion when his
exceptionally good manners could be used to good effect. The tea was
served in chemical beakers (‘because ordinary crockery is too ugly for
him!’), and ‘except that he was somewhat preoccupied by his duties as
host, [Wittgenstein] was in very good form’.52</p>
<p>When Pinsent’s parents had left, Wittgenstein proceeded to lecture
his friend about his character. Pinsent was, he said, ‘ideal in all
respects’:</p>
<p>… except that he [Wittgenstein] feared that with others except
himself I was lacking in generous instincts. He specially said – not
with himself – but he feared I did not treat my other friends so
generously. By ‘generously’ he did not imply the ordinary crude meaning
– but meant feelings of sympathy etc.</p>
<p>Pinsent took all this very well. ‘He was very nice about it all and
spoke in no way that one could resent.’ He was nevertheless inclined to
demur at Wittgenstein’s judgement. After all, Wittgenstein knew very
little of his other friends and his relations with them. He conceded,
however, that it might be true that he treated Wittgenstein differently
– after all, Wittgenstein was so different from other people (‘he is if
anything a bit mad’) that one had to treat him differently.</p>
<p>As Wittgenstein’s friendship with Pinsent grew warmer, his
relationship with Russell became increasingly strained. Russell was,
more and more, inclined to see in Wittgenstein his own faults writ large
– to feel that, faced with Wittgenstein, he knew how other people felt
when faced with himself. ‘He affects me just as I affect you’, he told
Ottoline:53</p>
<p>I get to know every turn and twist of the ways in which I irritate
and depress you from watching how he irritates and depresses me; and at
the same time I love and admire him. Also I affect him just as you
affect me when you are cold. The parallelism is curiously close
altogether. He differs from me just as I differ from you. He is clearer,
more creative, more passionate; I am broader, more sympathetic, more
sane. I have overstated the parallel for the sake of symmetry, but there
is something in it.</p>
<p>Emphasis on this parallel may have misled Russell. He was inclined to
see Wittgenstein’s faults as those ‘characteristic of logicians’: ‘His
faults are exactly mine – always analysing, pulling things up by the
roots, trying to get the exact truth of what one feels towards him.54 I
see it is very tiring and deadening to one’s affections.’ But the story
he tells in illustration of this could point to a different moral – not
that Wittgenstein was too analytical, but that he himself was too
remote:</p>
<p>I had an awful time with Wittgenstein yesterday between tea and
dinner. He came analysing all that goes wrong between him and me and I
told him I thought it was only nerves on both sides and everything was
all right at bottom. Then he said he never knew whether I was speaking
the truth or being polite, so I got vexed and refused to say another
word. He went on and on and on. I sat down at my table and took up my
pen and began to look through a book, but he still went on. At last I
said sharply ‘All you want is a little self-control.’ Then at last he
went away with an air of high tragedy. He had asked me to a concert in
the evening, but he didn’t come, so I began to fear suicide. However, I
found him in his room late (I left the concert, but didn’t find him at
first), and told him I was sorry I had been cross, and then talked
quietly about how he could improve.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had to keep himself aloof to stop himself being submerged.
But though Russell could turn a deaf ear to Wittgenstein’s personal
haranguing, he could not withstand the power of his philosophical
onslaughts. During this summer Wittgenstein had a decisive influence on
Russell’s development as a philosopher – chiefly by undermining his
faith in his own judgement. Looking back on it three years later,
Russell described it as: ‘an event of first-rate importance in my life’,
which had ‘affected everything I have done since’:55</p>
<p>Do you remember that at the time when you were seeing Vittoz
[Ottoline’s doctor] I wrote a lot of stuff about Theory of Knowledge,
which Wittgenstein criticised with the greatest severity? … I saw he was
right, and I saw that I could not hope ever again to do fundamental work
in philosophy. My impulse was shattered, like a wave dashed to pieces
against a breakwater. I became filled with utter despair … I had to
produce lectures for America, but I took a metaphysical subject although
I was and am convinced that all fundamental work in philosophy is
logical. My reason was that Wittgenstein persuaded me that what wanted
doing in logic was too difficult for me. So there was no really vital
satisfaction of my philosophical impulse in that work, and philosophy
lost its hold on me. That was due to Wittgenstein more than to the
war.</p>
<p>The ‘stuff about Theory of Knowledge’ that Russell mentions was the
beginning of what he hoped would be a major work. It grew out of his
work on matter, and was stimulated in part by an invitation to lecture
in America. He had already written the first chapter of it before he
even mentioned it to Wittgenstein. ‘It all flows out’, he wrote
euphorically to Ottoline on 8 May. ’It is all in my head ready to be
written out as fast as my pen will go. I feel as happy as a king.’56 His
euphoria lasted only so long as he kept his writing secret from
Wittgenstein. The fact that he did so seems to indicate that he was
never as convinced of its worth as his letters to Ottoline would
suggest. He seemed to know instinctively what Wittgenstein’s reaction
would be to a work that was metaphysical rather than logical in
character. Sure enough: Wittgenstein disliked the very idea of it. ’He
thinks it will be like the shilling shocker, which he hates. He is a
tyrant, if you like.’57</p>
<p>Russell pressed on regardless, and before the end of May had written
six chapters of what was clearly becoming a sizeable volume. Then came
the blow that was to shatter his impulse and convince him that he was no
longer capable of fundamental work in philosophy. In discussing the
work, Wittgenstein made what at first seemed a relatively unimportant
objection to Russell’s Theory of Judgement. Initially, Russell was
confident that it could be overcome. ‘He was right, but I think the
correction required is not very serious’, he told Ottoline.58 Just a
week later, however, it seemed to him that the very basis of his work
had been undermined:</p>
<p>We were both cross from the heat – I showed him a crucial part of
what I had been writing.59 He said it was all wrong, not realizing the
difficulties – that he had tried my view and knew it couldn’t work. I
couldn’t understand his objection – in fact he was very inarticulate –
but I feel in my bones that he must be right, and that he has seen
something I have missed. If I could see it too I shouldn’t mind, but, as
it is, it is worrying, and has rather destroyed the pleasure in my
writing – I can only go on with what I see, and yet I feel it is
probably all wrong, and that Wittgenstein will think me a dishonest
scoundrel for going on with it. Well, well – it is the younger
generation knocking at the door – I must make room for him when I can,
or I shall become an incubus. But at the moment I was rather cross.</p>
<p>It is a measure of Russell’s lack of confidence that, even though he
did not understand Wittgenstein’s objections, he felt they must be
justified. ‘But even if they are’, he wrote with unconvincing
equanimity, ‘they won’t destroy the value of the book.60 His criticisms
have to do with the problems I want to leave to him.’ In other words,
Wittgenstein’s criticisms were logical rather than metaphysical. But if,
as Russell believed, the problems of philosophy were fundamentally
logical, how could it not affect the value of the book? How could the
book be sound if its foundations were not? When Wittgenstein was finally
able to put his objections in writing, Russell admitted defeat,
unreservedly. ‘I am very sorry to hear that my objection to your theory
of judgment paralyses you’, Wittgenstein wrote.61 ‘I think it can only
be removed by a correct theory of propositions.’ Such a theory was one
of the things that Russell had wanted to leave to Wittgenstein. Being
convinced that it was at once necessary and beyond his own capabilities,
he came to think that he was no longer able to contribute to philosophy
of the most fundamental kind.</p>
<p>The conviction produced in him an almost suicidal depression. The
huge work on the Theory of Knowledge, begun with such vigour and
optimism, was now abandoned. But as he was contractually obliged to
deliver the series of lectures in America, he had to continue with his
preparations for them, even though he was now convinced that the
material he had written for them was fundamentally in error. ‘I must be
much sunk’, he told Ottoline, ‘it is the first time in my life that I
have failed in honesty over work.62 Yesterday I felt ready for suicide.’
Four months previously he had written: ’Ten years ago I could have
written a book with the store of ideas I have already, but now I have a
higher standard of exactness.’63 That standard had been set by
Wittgenstein, and it was one he now felt unable to live up to. He did
not recover faith in his work until Wittgenstein was out of the way –
and even then he felt it necessary to reassure himself in his absence
that: ’Wittgenstein would like the work I have done lately.’64</p>
<p>It says much for the generosity of Russell’s spirit that, although
devastated by Wittgenstein’s criticisms of his own work, he could yet
rejoice when he heard from Wittgenstein – during the late summer of 1913
– that his work was going well. He wrote to Ottoline: ’You can hardly
believe what a load this lifts off my spirits – it makes me feel almost
young and gay.’65</p>
<p>Wittgenstein felt himself to have made a substantial breakthrough.
When, at the end of August, he met Pinsent in London, he gave him an
almost ecstatic account of his ‘latest discoveries’, which were,
according to Pinsent, ‘truly amazing and have solved all the problems on
which he has been working unsatisfactorily for the last year’.66 They
constituted a system which was: ‘wonderfully simple and ingenious and
seems to clear up everything’:</p>
<p>Of course he has upset a lot of Russell’s work (Russell’s work on the
fundamental concepts of Logic that is: on his purely Mathematical work –
for instance most of his ‘Principia’ – it has no bearing. Wittgenstein’s
chief interest is in the very fundamental part of the subject) – but
Russell would be the last to resent that, and really the greatness of
his work suffers little thereby – as it is obvious that Wittgenstein is
one of Russell’s disciples and owes enormously to him. But
Wittgenstein’s work is really amazing – and I really believe that the
mucky morass of Philosophy is at last crystallising about a rigid theory
of Logic – the only portion of Philosophy about which there is any
possibility of man knowing anything – Metaphysics etc: are hampered by
total lack of data. (Really Logic is all Philosophy. All else that is
loosely so termed is either Metaphysics – which is hopeless, there being
no data – or Natural Science e.g.: Psychology.</p>
<p>And yet, frustratingly – despite the fact that he had, apparently,
already developed a system of logic that completely transformed
philosophy – there is still no written record of Wittgenstein’s work.
Whether the overstatements that the system ‘cleared up everything’ and
‘solved all the problems’ are due to Wittgenstein or to Pinsent is
impossible to say. But a few weeks later we learn from a letter of
Wittgenstein’s to Russell that: ’There are still some very difficult
problems (and very fundamental ones too) to be solved and I won’t begin
to write until I have got some sort of a solution for them.’67</p>
<p>Pinsent had arranged to meet Wittgenstein under the impression that
he would then be taken on a holiday to Spain. When they met, however, he
was told there had been a change of plan. Spain had (for some
unspecified reason) given way to three other alternatives: Andorra, the
Azores or Bergen, in Norway. Pinsent was to choose – ‘He was very
anxious to shew no preference for any particular scheme and that I
should choose unbiased’ – but it was quite obvious that Wittgenstein’s
choice was Norway, so Pinsent opted for that.68 (Actually, he would have
preferred the Azores, but Wittgenstein feared they would meet crowds of
American tourists on the boat, ‘which he can’t stand!’)</p>
<p>So we are going to Norway and not Spain after all! Why Wittgenstein
should have suddenly changed his mind at the last moment I can’t think!
But I expect it will be great fun in Norway all the same.</p>
<p>Before they left, Wittgenstein travelled to Cambridge to explain his
new work to Russell and Whitehead. Both, according to Pinsent, were
enthusiastic, and agreed that the first volume of Principia would now
have to be rewritten in the light of it (if this is so, Whitehead must
have had a change of heart later on) with Wittgenstein himself perhaps
rewriting the first eleven chapters: ’That is a splendid triumph for
him!’69</p>
<p>As he assumed (or appeared to assume) more and more responsibility
for the future of Russellian mathematical logic, Wittgenstein became
ever more nervously susceptible. As they set sail from Hull to
Christiania (now Oslo), he revealed himself to be in an extraordinarily
fraught frame of mind:</p>
<p>Soon after we had sailed Wittgenstein suddenly appeared in an awful
panic – saying that his portmanteau, with all his manuscripts inside,
had been left behind at Hull … Wittgenstein was in an awful state about
it.70 Then, just as I was thinking of sending a wireless message about
it, – it was found in the corridor outside someone else’s cabin!</p>
<p>They reached Christiania, where they stayed overnight, before taking
the train to Bergen, on 1 September. At the hotel Wittgenstein,
apparently thinking of their occasional differences in Iceland the
previous year, remarked to Pinsent: ‘We have got on splendidly so far,
haven’t we?’ Pinsent responded with typically English reserve.71 ‘I
always find it exceedingly hard to respond to his fervent outbursts, and
I suppose this time I instinctively tried to turn it off flippantly – I
am horribly shy of enthusiasm about that sort of thing.’ His reticence
deeply offended Wittgenstein, who said not a word to him for the rest of
the evening.</p>
<p>The following morning he was still ‘absolutely sulky and snappish’.72
On the train they had to change their seats at the last moment because
Wittgenstein insisted on being away from other tourists:</p>
<p>Then a very genial Englishman came along and talked to me and finally
insisted on our coming into his carriage to smoke – as ours was a
non-smoker. Witt: refused to move, and of course I had to go for a short
time at least – it would have been violently rude to refuse. I came back
as soon as I could and found him in an awful state. I made some remark
about the Englishman being a weird person – whereat he turned and said
‘I could travel the whole way with him if I pleased.’ And then I had it
all out with him and finally brought him round to a normal and genial
frame of mind.</p>
<p>‘I have to be frightfully careful and tolerant when he gets these
sulky fits’, Pinsent adds. ‘He is – in his acute sensitiveness – very
like Levin in “Anna Karenina”, and thinks the most awful things of me
when he is sulky – but is very contrite afterwards’:</p>
<p>I am afraid he is in an even more sensitive neurotic state just now
than usual, and it will be very hard to avoid friction altogether. We
can always avoid it at Cambridge, when we don’t see so much of each
other: but he never will understand that it becomes infinitely harder
when we are together so much as now: and it puzzles him frightfully.</p>
<p>The quarrel on the train seemed to mark some kind of turning point in
their relationship. Wittgenstein is now referred to as ‘Ludwig’ for the
remainder of Pinsent’s diary.</p>
<p>On reaching Bergen they went to a tourist office to make enquiries as
to where they could find the sort of place that Wittgenstein wanted: a
small hotel, somewhere on a fjord, set in pleasant country and entirely
away from tourists. A perfect place, in other words, for Wittgenstein to
work on logic undisturbed. (It must by now have been obvious that this
was the reason for the last-minute change in plan.) He had already begun
his work in the hotel in Bergen. ‘When he is working’, Pinsent noted,
’he mutters to himself (in a mixture of German and English) and strides
up and down the room all the while.’73</p>
<p>The tourist office found them a place satisfying all their conditions
– a small hotel in a tiny village called Öistesjo, on the Hardanger
fjord, at which they would be the only foreign tourists, the other ten
guests being Norwegian. Once there they went for a short walk, Pinsent,
ever the keen photographer, taking his camera, ‘which was the cause of
another scene with Ludwig’:74</p>
<p>We were getting on perfectly amicably – when I left him for a moment
to take a photo: And when I overtook him again he was silent and sulky.
I walked on with him in silence for half an hour, and then asked him
what was the matter. It seemed, my keenness to take that photo: had
disgusted him – ‘like a man who can think of nothing – when walking –
but how the country would do for a golf course’. I had a long talk with
him about it, and eventually we made it up again. He is really in an
awful neurotic state: this evening he blamed himself violently and
expressed the most piteous disgust with himself.</p>
<p>In an ironically apt comparison, Pinsent remarks: ‘at present it is
no exaggeration to say he is as bad – (in that nervous sensibility) – as
people like Beethoven were’. Perhaps he had not been told that
Wittgenstein regarded Beethoven as exactly ‘the sort of man to be’.</p>
<p>Henceforth, Pinsent took great care not to offend or irritate
Wittgenstein, and the rest of the holiday passed without another scene.
They very quickly settled into a routine that suited Wittgenstein
perfectly: they worked in the morning, went walking or sailing in the
early afternoon, worked in the late afternoon, and played dominoes in
the evening. For Pinsent it was all rather dull – ‘just enough to do to
keep one from being bored’.75 There was none of the novelty and romance
of a pony cortège through the Icelandic countryside, and in his diary he
is forced to linger on what little excitement there was to be found in
an empty hotel (the other guests having left soon after Pinsent and
Wittgenstein arrived) in an isolated part of Norway – returning again
and again, for example, to their attempts to rid the hotel of a wasps’
nest they had found in the roof.</p>
<p>For Wittgenstein, however, it was perfect. He was able to write to
Russell in a mood of great contentment:</p>
<p>I am sitting here in a little place inside a beautiful fiord and
thinking about the beastly theory of types … Pinsent is an enormous
comfort to me here.76 We have hired a little sailing boat and go about
with it on the fiord, or rather Pinsent is doing all the sailing and I
sit in the boat and work.</p>
<p>One question nagged at him:</p>
<p>Shall I get anything out??! It would be awful if I did not and all my
work would be lost. However I am not losing courage and go on thinking …
I very often now have the indescribable feeling as though my work was
all sure to be lost entirely in some way or other. But I still hope that
this won’t come true.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s mood – as always – fluctuated with his ability to
work. And it fell to Pinsent to cheer him up when he was depressed about
his progress. On 17 September, for example, we read:</p>
<p>During all the morning and most of the afternoon Ludwig was very
gloomy and unapproachable – and worked at Logic all the time … I somehow
succeeded in cheering him up – back to his normal frame of mind – and
after tea we went for a stroll together (it was a fine sunny day).77 We
got talking and it appeared that it had been some very serious
difficulty with the ‘Theory of Types’ that had depressed him all today.
He is morbidly afraid he may die before he has put the Theory of Types
to rights, and before he has written out all his other work in such a
way as shall be intelligable to the world and of some use to the science
of Logic. He has written a lot already – and Russell has promised to
publish his work if he were to die – but he is sure that what he has
already written is not sufficiently well put, so as absolutely to make
plain his real methods of thought etc: – which of course are of more
value than his definite results. He is always saying that he is certain
he will die within four years – but today it was two months.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s feeling that he might die before being able to publish
his work intensified during his last week in Norway, and prompted him to
write to Russell asking if Russell would be prepared to meet him ‘as
soon as possible and give me time enough to give you a survey of the
whole field of what I have done up to now and if possible to let me make
notes for you in your presence’.78 It is to this that we owe the
existence of Notes on Logic, the earliest surviving exposition of
Wittgenstein’s thought.</p>
<p>In his anxiety, this feeling that he might die soon became an
unchangeable conviction that he was bound to do so. Everything he said
or did became based on this assumption. He was not afraid to die, he
told Pinsent – ‘but yet frightfully worried not to let the few remaining
moments of his life be wasted’:79</p>
<p>It all hangs on his absolutely morbid and mad conviction that he is
going to die soon – there is no obvious reason that I can see why he
should not live yet for a long time. But it is no use trying to dispel
that conviction, or his worries about it, by reason: the conviction and
the worry he can’t help – for he is mad.</p>
<p>Another, related, anxiety was that his work on logic might perhaps,
after all, be of no real use: ‘and then his nervous temperament had
caused him a life of misery and others considerable inconvenience – all
for nothing’.</p>
<p>Pinsent seems to have done a marvellous job of keeping Wittgenstein’s
spirits up throughout these attacks of crippling anxiety – encouraging
him, reassuring him, playing dominoes with him, taking him out sailing
and, above all, perhaps, playing music with him. During the holiday they
put together a repertoire of some forty Schubert songs, Wittgenstein
whistling the air and Pinsent playing the accompaniment.</p>
<p>It is perhaps not surprising to find that their perceptions of the
holiday differed sharply. Wittgenstein said he had never enjoyed a
holiday so much. Pinsent was less enthusiastic: ’I am enjoying myself
pretty fairly … But living with Ludwig alone in his present neurotic
state is trying at times.’80 On his return, on 2 October, he swore that
he would never go away with Wittgenstein again.</p>
<p>At the end of the holiday Wittgenstein ‘suddenly announced a scheme
of the most alarming nature’:81</p>
<p>To wit: that he should exile himself and live for some years right
away from everybody he knows – say in Norway. That he should live
entirely alone and by himself – a hermits life – and do nothing but work
in Logic. His reasons for this are very queer to me – but no doubt they
are very real for him: firstly he thinks he will do infinitely more and
better work in such circumstances, than at Cambridge, where, he says,
his constant liability to interruption and distractions (such as
concerts) is an awful hindrance. Secondly he feels that he has no right
to live in an antipathetic world (and of course to him very few people
are sympathetic) – a world where he perpetually finds himself feeling
contempt for others, and irritating others by his nervous temperament –
without some justification for that contempt etc:, such as being a
really great man and having done really great work.</p>
<p>Part of this argument is familiar: if he is to behave like Beethoven,
he ought, like Beethoven, to produce really great work. What is new is
the conviction that this is impossible at Cambridge.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s mind was not definitely made up on the scheme,
however, and he continued with preparations for a course of lectures on
philosophy that he had agreed to give at the Working Men’s College in
London. The issue was finally decided when they reached Newcastle on the
way home. There Wittgenstein received a letter from Gretl telling him
that she and her American husband, Jerome Stonborough, were coming to
live in London. That appeared to settle the matter. He could not, he
told Pinsent, stand to live in England if he were perpetually liable to
visits from the Stonboroughs.</p>
<p>He even convinced Pinsent – who at first was inclined to think the
idea absurd – that he should, after all, go to Norway to work on logic.
For: ‘He has settled many difficulties, but there are still others
unsolved.’82 And: ‘The great difficulty about his particular kind of
work is that – unless he absolutely settles all the foundations of Logic
– his work will be of little value to the world.’ So: ‘There is nothing
between doing really great work andandandand doing practically
nothing.’</p>
<p>Pinsent appears to have accepted the force of this reasoning, even
though it has nothing whatever to do with the fact of the Stonboroughs
being in England, does not explain why Wittgenstein has to be alone, and
is in sharp contrast to the view he had accepted just a week before
(that Wittgenstein’s method was the important thing, not his results).
The argument appears, in fact, to be a restatement of the terrible
dichotomy raised by Weininger – greatness or nothingness. But in order
to make it an intelligible reason for living away from Cambridge, one
would perhaps have to add to it two other Weiningerian themes: that love
is conducive to greatness, sexual desire inimical to it; and that
‘sexual desire increases with physical proximity; love is strongest in
the absence of the loved one; it needs a separation, a certain distance
to preserve it’.83</p>
<p>The possibility of greatness, therefore, demands a separation from
the loved one.</p>
