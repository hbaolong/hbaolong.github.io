<p>The Blue and Brown Books</p>
<p>AFTER WITTGENSTEIN’S RETURN to Cambridge for the academic year of
1933–4, Wittgenstein and Skinner were rarely to be seen apart: they both
had rooms in college; they walked together, talked together, and
whatever social life they had (chiefly going to the cinema to watch
Westerns and musicals) was shared. Above all, perhaps, they worked
together.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein began the term, as he had the previous year, by giving
two sets of lectures, one entitled ‘Philosophy’, and the other
‘Philosophy for Mathematicians’. The second set, much to his dismay,
proved particularly popular, between thirty and forty people turning up
– far too many for the kind of informal lectures he wanted to deliver.
After three or four weeks he amazed his audience by telling them that he
could no longer continue to lecture in this way, and that he proposed
instead to dictate his lectures to a small group of students, so that
they could be copied and handed out to the others. The idea, as he later
put it to Russell, was that the students would then ‘have something to
take home with them, in their hands if not in their brains’. The select
group included his five favourite students – Skinner, Louis Goodstein,
H. M. S. Coxeter, Margaret Masterman and Alice Ambrose. The duplicated
set of notes was bound in blue paper covers and has been known ever
since as ‘The Blue Book’.</p>
<p>This was the first publication in any form of Wittgenstein’s new
method of philosophy, and as such it created great interest. Further
copies were made and distributed, and the book reached a far wider
audience than Wittgenstein had expected – much wider, indeed, than he
would have wished. By the late 1930s, for example, it had been
distributed among many members of the philosophy faculty of Oxford. The
Blue Book was thus responsible for introducing into philosophic
discourse the notion of a ‘language-game’ and the technique, based upon
it, for dissolving philosophical confusion.</p>
<p>In many ways the Blue Book can be regarded as an early prototype for
subsequent presentations of Wittgenstein’s later philosophy. Like all
future attempts to arrange his work in coherent form (including the
Brown Book and Philosophical Investigations), it begins with ‘one of the
great sources of philosophical bewilderment’ – i.e. the tendency to be
misled by substantives to look for something that corresponds to them.
Thus, we ask: ‘What is time?’, ‘What is meaning?’, ‘What is knowledge?’,
‘What is a thought?’, ‘What are numbers?’ etc., and expect to be able to
answer these questions by naming some thing. The technique of
language-games was designed to break the hold of this tendency:</p>
<p>I shall in the future again and again draw your attention to what I
shall call language games.1 These are ways of using signs simpler than
those in which we use the signs of our highly complicated everyday
language. Language games are the forms of language with which a child
begins to make use of words. The study of language games is the study of
primitive forms of language or primitive languages. If we want to study
the problems of truth and falsehood, of the agreement and disagreement
of propositions with reality, of the nature of assertion, assumption,
and question, we shall with great advantage look at primitive forms of
language in which these forms of thinking appear without the confusing
background of highly complicated processes of thought. When we look at
such simple forms of language the mental mist which seems to enshroud
our ordinary use of language disappears. We see activities, reactions,
which are clear-cut and transparent.</p>
<p>Connected with the inclination to look for a substance corresponding
to a substantive is the idea that, for any given concept, there is an
‘essence’ – something that is common to all the things subsumed under a
general term. Thus, for example, in the Platonic dialogues, Socrates
seeks to answer philosophical questions such as: ‘What is knowledge?’ by
looking for something that all examples of knowledge have in common. (In
connection with this, Wittgenstein once said that his method could be
summed up by saying that it was the exact opposite of that of Socrates.)
In the Blue Book Wittgenstein seeks to replace this notion of essence
with the more flexible idea of family resemblances:</p>
<p>We are inclined to think that there must be something in common to
all games, say, and that this common property is the justification for
applying the general term ‘game’ to the various games; whereas games
form a family the members of which have family likenesses.2 Some of them
have the same nose, others the same eyebrows and others again the same
way of walking; and these likenesses overlap.</p>
<p>The search for essences is, Wittgenstein states, an example of ‘the
craving for generality’ that springs from our preoccupation with the
method of science:</p>
<p>Philosophers constantly see the method of science before their eyes,
and are irresistibly tempted to ask and answer questions in the way
science does.3 This tendency is the real source of metaphysics, and
leads the philosopher into complete darkness.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s avoidance of this tendency – his complete refusal to
announce any general conclusions – is perhaps the main feature that
makes his work difficult to understand, for without having the moral
pointed out, so to speak, it is often difficult to see the point of his
remarks. As he himself once explained at the beginning of a series of
lectures: ’What we say will be easy, but to know why we say it will be
very difficult.’4</p>
<p>During the Christmas vacation of 1933 Skinner wrote to Wittgenstein
every few days, telling him how much he missed him, how often he thought
about him and how much he was longing to see him again. Every last
moment he had spent with Wittgenstein was recalled with fond
affection:</p>
<p>After I stopped waving my handkerchief to you I walked through
Folkestone and took the train at 8.28 back to London.5 I thought about
you and how wonderful it had been when we said goodbye … I loved very
much seeing you off. I miss you a great deal and think about you a
lot.</p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Francis</p>
<p>At the family Christmas at the Alleegasse, Marguerite (who continued
to spend Christmas in Vienna as the guest of Gretl) caused something of
a sensation by announcing her engagement to Talle Sjögren. Encouraged by
Gretl, but in the face of disapproval from her father, Marguerite
decided on an extremely short engagement, and she and Talle were married
on New Year’s Eve. Her father, at least, was a safe distance away in
Switzerland. Wittgenstein was not. Recalling her wedding day, she
writes:</p>
<p>My despair reached its zenith when Ludwig came to see me on the
Sunday morning, an hour before my wedding.6 ‘You are taking a boat, the
sea will be rough, remain always attached to me so that you don’t
capsize’, he said to me. Until that moment I hadn’t realised his deep
attachment nor perhaps his great deception. For years I had been like
soft putty in his hands which he had worked to shape into a better
being. He had been like a Samaritan who gives new life to someone who is
failing.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that she had not appreciated until that day how
deep was Wittgenstein’s attachment to her. It is characteristic,
however, of many of his friendships that she should have felt his
involvement in her life to have had a fundamentally ethical purpose. ‘He
conjured up a vision of a better you’, as Fania Pascal has put it. It
was, after all, partly because she did not want to live with this kind
of moral pressure that Marguerite had chosen to marry someone else.</p>
<p>For most of 1934 Wittgenstein continued to work on three different,
but related, projects, which attempted to solve the problem he had
described in his letter to Mind – that of presenting his philosophical
method ‘in a clear and coherent form’. At Cambridge, as well as
dictating the Blue Book, he also made copious revisions to the Big
Typescript – ‘pottering about with it’, as he put it to Russell. (The
results of this ‘pottering about’ have been incorporated into the first
part of Philosophical Grammar). In Vienna he continued to co-operate
(albeit with increasing reluctance and with ever-growing misgivings)
with the scheme to publish a book with Waismann. In the Easter vacation
of 1934, this scheme took a new turn: it was now proposed that Waismann
and Wittgenstein should be co-authors, with Wittgenstein providing the
raw material and taking control of the form and structure, and Waismann
being responsible for writing it up in a clear and coherent way.
Waismann, that is to say, was given what Wittgenstein himself regarded
as the most difficult part of the job.</p>
<p>With each new arrangement Waismann’s position seemed to get worse. By
August he was complaining to Schlick about the difficulties of writing a
book with Wittgenstein:</p>
<p>He has the great gift of always seeing things as if for the first
time. But it shows, I think, how difficult collaborative work with him
is, since he is always following up the inspiration of the moment and
demolishing what he has previously sketched out … all one sees is that
the structure is being demolished bit by bit and that everything is
gradually taking on an entirely different appearance, so that one almost
gets the feeling that it doesn’t matter at all how the thoughts are put
together since in the end nothing is left as it was.7</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s habit of following up the inspiration of the moment
applied not only to his work, but also to his life. In 1934, despite the
fact that he was then involved in two projects to prepare a book for
publication (Logik, Sprache, Philosophie in Vienna, and Philosophical
Grammar in England), he conceived the idea of giving up academic life
altogether and going, with Skinner, to live in Russia, where they would
both seek work as manual labourers. Skinner’s family was naturally
apprehensive about the idea, but for Skinner himself it had the
inestimable advantage that he would be with Wittgenstein all the time.
He had begun to regard being with Wittgenstein almost as a necessity;
away from Wittgenstein nothing looked the same or felt the same. ‘If I
am with you’, he wrote during the Easter vacation, ’I can feel
everything deeply.’8 It was a constant theme of his letters:</p>
<p>I thought of you a lot.9 I longed to have you with me. The night was
very wonderful and the stars looked particularly beautiful. I longed to
be able to feel everything in the way I would feel it if I was with you.
[25.3.34]</p>
<p>I long to be with you in any open space. I think of you a lot and how
wonderful our walks have been.10 I look forward enormously to our tour
next week. Yesterday I got your Easter card which was very lovely. I
thought the houses in the street on the other card looked very
beautiful. I should like to have looked at them with you. [4.4.34]</p>
<p>Skinner also stressed in his letters the moral necessity of having
Wittgenstein by his side, as though without Wittgenstein’s guidance he
would fall into the hands of the devil. The most remarkable instance of
this occurs in a letter written on 24 July 1934, the day after Skinner
had waved goodbye to Wittgenstein at Boulogne. The letter begins with
the by now customary remarks about how ‘wonderful and sweet’ it had been
waving goodbye; he then goes on to describe how sinful he became as soon
as he had been left alone in Boulogne. He had visited a casino, lost ten
francs and then, despite his best resolutions, had been tempted to
return, this time winning fifty francs. Disgusted with himself, he vowed
to return to England on the afternoon boat, but when the time came to
leave he was drawn once more into the casino. By this time, he was a
lost soul:</p>
<p>I started off again by playing very carefully and keeping myself very
restrained.11 Then I began to lose slightly and I suddenly lost my
restraint and care and played more and more recklessly. I became quite
feverishly excited and unable to control myself. Altogether I lost about
150 francs. I first lost all the French money which I had with me, about
80 francs, and then I changed a 10/- note into French money and lost it
all and then I changed all the loose English silver I had and lost it
all. I then left the Casino at about 5 o’clock. When I got out into the
fresh air I suddenly felt in what a horrible unnatural and loathesome
way I had been acting since I had begun to gamble. It seemed dreadful
that I should have felt such eagerness to win money. I suddenly realised
in what a mean filthy state of degradation I had fallen. I felt
physically stirred up and excited in my body. I walked about the streets
for a time in a wretched state of mind. I felt I understood why gamblers
often committed suicide for the feeling of degradation is so awful. I
felt a most terrible philistine. I felt I had been destroying myself. I
then returned to the Hotel and washed myself all over.</p>
<p>Skinner is no Dostoevsky, and his depiction of his own moral
depravity has a curiously unconvincing ring, but the effect he is trying
to achieve is surely something like that of the Russian novels he knew
Wittgenstein to have admired. His tale, with its evocation of desperate
suicidal guilt, seems to point inexorably towards the necessity of
redemptive religion. Indeed, he goes on to describe how, after washing
his hands, he sought out the church in Boulogne that he had visited with
Wittgenstein. Inside the church: ‘I thought of you a lot. I felt
comforted by the Church though I was hardly able to look at it at all.’
He adds: ‘I felt I would be a terrible rascal and be utterly unworthy of
your love if I wrote without saying anything.’</p>
<p>The religious theme is renewed a few weeks later, on 11 August, when
Skinner writes quoting the passage from Anna Karenina where the almost
suicidal Levin says: ‘I cannot live without knowing what I am.’ The
passage ends: ‘But Levin did not hang himself, or shoot himself, but
lived and struggled on.’ ‘When I read this last sentence’, Skinner tells
Wittgenstein, in a phrase that echoes many of Wittgenstein’s own, ‘I
suddenly realised I was reading something terrific’:12</p>
<p>I suddenly seemed to understand what all I had been reading meant. I
went on reading the following chapters and it all seemed written with
enormous truth. I felt as if I was reading the chapters of the Bible. I
didn’t understand it all but I felt it was religion. I wanted very much
to tell you this.</p>
<p>Skinner and Wittgenstein had, by this time, begun to take Russian
lessons together in preparation for their impending visit to the Soviet
Union. Their teacher was Fania Pascal, the wife of the Marxist
intellectual and Communist Party member Roy Pascal. In discussing
Wittgenstein’s motives for wanting to go to Russia, Mrs Pascal remarks:
‘To my mind, his feeling for Russia would have had at all times more to
do with Tolstoy’s moral teachings, with Dostoyevsky’s spiritual
insights, than with any political or social matters.’ The tone and
content of Skinner’s letters seems to confirm this. And yet it was not
the Russia of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky that Wittgenstein and Skinner
wanted to visit, and in which they planned to find work; it was the
Russia of Stalin’s Five Year Plans. And neither of them could possibly
have been so politically naïve or so ill-informed as not to recognize
any difference between the two.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein probably struck Pascal as ‘an old-time conservative’
because of his hostility to Marxism. But many of Wittgenstein’s other
friends received a very different impression. George Thomson, for
example, who knew Wittgenstein well during the 1930s, speaks of
Wittgenstein’s ‘growing political awareness’ during those years, and
says that, although he did not discuss politics very often with
Wittgenstein, he did so ‘enough to show that he kept himself informed
about current events.13 He was alive to the evils of unemployment and
fascism and the growing danger of war.’ Thomson adds, in relation to
Wittgenstein’s attitude to Marxism: ‘He was opposed to it in theory, but
supported it in practice.’ This chimes with a remark Wittgenstein once
made to Rowland Hutt (a close friend of Skinner’s who came to know
Wittgenstein in 1934): ‘I am a communist, at heart.’ It should be
remembered, too, that many of Wittgenstein’s friends of this period, and
particularly the friends on whom he relied for information about the
Soviet Union, were Marxists.14 In addition to George Thomson, there were
Piero Sraffa, whose opinion Wittgenstein valued above all others on
questions of politics, Nicholas Bachtin and Maurice Dobb. There is no
doubt that during the political upheavals of the mid-1930s
Wittgenstein’s sympathies were with the working class and the
unemployed, and that his allegiance, broadly speaking, was with the
Left.</p>
<p>However, it remains true that Russia’s attraction for Wittgenstein
had little or nothing to do with Marxism as a political and economic
theory, and much to do with the sort of life he believed was being led
in the Soviet Union. This emerged during a conversation which
Wittgenstein and Skinner had with Maurice Drury in the summer of 1934,
when they spent a summer holiday at Drury’s brother’s cottage in
Connemara, on the west coast of Ireland. On their arrival Drury prepared
for them a rather elaborate meal consisting of roast chicken followed by
suet pudding and treacle. Wittgenstein expressed his disapproval,
insisting that while they were staying at Connemara they should eat
nothing but porridge for breakfast, vegetables for lunch and a boiled
egg in the evening. When the subject of Russia came up, Skinner
announced that he wanted to do something ‘fiery’, a way of thinking that
struck Wittgenstein as dangerous. ‘I think’, said Drury, ‘Francis means
that he doesn’t want to take the treacle with him.’ Wittgenstein was
delighted. ‘Oh, that is an excellent expression: I understand what that
means entirely.15 No, we don’t want to take the treacle with us.’</p>
<p>Presumably, for Wittgenstein, the life of a manual labourer in Russia
was the epitome of a life without treacle. During the following year, to
give Skinner some taste of what that would be like, he arranged for
Skinner, together with Rowland Hutt, to spend six weeks working on a
farm during the winter months. Wittgenstein himself came out one morning
at six o’clock on a cold February day to help with the work.</p>
<p>During the year 1934–5 Wittgenstein dictated what is now known as the
Brown Book. This, unlike the Blue Book, was not a substitute for a
series of lectures, but rather an attempt by Wittgenstein to formulate
the results of his own work for his own sake. It was dictated to Skinner
and Alice Ambrose, who sat with Wittgenstein for between two and four
hours a day for four days a week. The Brown Book is divided into two
parts, corresponding, roughly, to the method and its application. Part
I, introducing the method of language-games, reads almost like a
textbook. After an introductory paragraph describing St Augustine’s
account of ‘How, as a boy, he learned to talk’, it consists of
seventy-two numbered ‘exercises’, many of which invite the reader to,
for example:</p>
<p>Imagine a people in whose language there is no such form of sentence
as ‘the book is in the drawer’ or ‘water is in the glass’, but wherever
we should use these forms they say, ‘The book can be taken out of the
drawer’, ‘The water can be taken out of the glass’.16 [see here]</p>
<p>Imagine a tribe in whose language there is an expression
corresponding to our ‘He has done so and so’, and another expression
corresponding to our ‘He can do so and so’, this latter expression,
however, being used only where its use is justified by the same fact
which would also justify the former expression.17 [see here]</p>
<p>Imagine that human beings or animals were used as reading machines;
assume that in order to become reading machines they need a particular
training.18 [see here]</p>
<p>The book is difficult to read because the point of imagining these
various situations is very rarely spelt out. Wittgenstein simply leads
the reader through a series of progressively more complicated
language-games, occasionally pausing to remark on various features of
the games he is describing. When he does make the point of these remarks
explicit, he claims it is to ward off thoughts that may give rise to
philosophical puzzlement. It is as though the book was intended to serve
as a text in a course designed to nip in the bud any latent
philosophizing. Thus we are first introduced to a language which
contains just four nouns – ‘cube’, ‘brick’, ‘slab’ and ‘column’ – and
which is used in a building ‘game’ (one builder shouts, ‘Brick!’ and
another brings him a brick). In subsequent games this proto-language is
supplemented by the addition first of numerals, and then of proper
nouns, the words ‘this’ and ‘there’, questions and answers, and finally
colour words. So far, no philosophical moral has been drawn other than
that, in understanding how these various languages are used, it is not
necessary to postulate the existence of mental images; all the games
could be played with or without such images. The unspoken point of this
is to loosen the hold of the idea that mental images are an essential
concomitant to any meaningful use of language.</p>
<p>It is not until we have been led through another series of
language-games, which introduce, first, the notion of an infinite
series, and then the notions of ‘past’, ‘present’ and ‘future’, that
Wittgenstein explicitly mentions the relevance of all this to
philosophical problems. After describing a series of language-games with
more or less primitive means of distinguishing one time of day from
another, he contrasts these with our own language, which permits the
construction of such questions as: ‘Where does the present go when it
becomes past, and where is the past?’ ‘Here’, he says, ‘is one of the
most fertile sources of philosophic puzzlement.’19 To a reader studying
the Brown Book as a work of philosophy, this statement, the only mention
of philosophy in the first thirty pages of the book, comes as something
of a relief. Such questions, he states, arise because we are misled by
our symbolism into certain analogies (in this case, the analogy between
a past event and a thing, the analogy between our saying ‘Something has
happened’ and ‘Something came towards me’). Similarly: ‘We are inclined
to say that both “now” and “six o’clock” refer to points in time. This
use of words produces a puzzlement which one might express in the
question: “What is the ‘now’?” – for it is a moment of time and yet it
can’t be said to be either the “moment at which I speak” or “the moment
at which the clock strikes”, etc.,20 etc.’ Here, in relation to what is
essentially St Augustine’s problem of time, Wittgenstein finally spells
out the point of his procedure:</p>
<p>Our answer is: the function of the word ‘now’ is entirely different
from that of a specification of time – This can easily be seen if we
look at the role this word really plays in our usage of language, but it
is obscured when instead of looking at the whole language game, we only
look at the contexts, the phrases of language in which the word is
used.21</p>
<p>There is no indication that Wittgenstein considered publishing the
Brown Book. On 31 July 1935 he wrote to Schlick describing it as a
document which shows ‘the way in which I think the whole stuff should be
handled’.22 Perhaps, as he was then planning to leave philosophy
altogether to take up manual work in Russia, it represents an attempt to
present the results of his seven years’ work in philosophy in a way that
would enable someone else (perhaps Waismann) to make use of them.</p>
<p>It is unlikely, however, that he would ever have been satisfied with
the attempts of another to represent his thought faithfully. Again and
again attempts were made by others to present his ideas, and again and
again he reacted angrily, accusing whoever used his ideas of plagiarism
if they did not acknowledge their debt, or misrepresentation if they
did. During the dictation of the Brown Book, it was the turn of Alice
Ambrose to encounter his wrath on this point. She planned to publish in
Mind an article entitled ‘Finitism in Mathematics’, in which she would
present what she took to be Wittgenstein’s view on the matter. The
article annoyed Wittgenstein intensely, and he tried hard to persuade
her not to publish it. When she and G. E. Moore, who was then editor of
the journal, refused to succumb to this pressure, he abruptly ended any
association with her. In the letter to Schlick mentioned above, however,
he blames not her, but the academics who encouraged her to go ahead with
the article. The fault lay primarily, he thought, with the curiosity of
academic philosophers to know what his new work was all about before he
felt able to publish his results himself. Reluctant as he was to cast
pearls before swine, he was nonetheless determined they should not be
offered counterfeits.</p>
