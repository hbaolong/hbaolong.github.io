<h4 id="a-new-beginning">14 A NEW BEGINNING</h4>
<p>FOR WITTGENSTEIN, EVERYTHING depended on the spirit. This is as true
of his philosophy as it is of his personal relationships. What
distinguished his rejection of metaphysics from that of the logical
positivists, for example, was, above all else, the spirit in which it
was done. In the forewords he had written in the Michaelmas term of 1930
he had tried to make the spirit of his work explicit. In 1931, he
considered another possibility, a way of showing what he had previously
tried to say. ‘I think now’, he wrote, ‘that the right thing would be to
begin my book with remarks about metaphysics as a kind of magic’:1</p>
<p>But in doing this I must neither speak in defence of magic nor
ridicule it.</p>
<p>What it is that is deep about magic would be kept. –</p>
<p>In this context, in fact, keeping magic out has itself the character
of magic.</p>
<p>For when I began in my earlier book to talk about the ‘world’ (and
not about this tree or this table), was I trying to do anything except
conjure up something of a higher order by my words?</p>
<p>He was dissatisfied by these remarks, and wrote ‘S’ (for ‘schlecht’ =
‘bad’) by the side of them. But they are nonetheless revealing of his
intentions. Given that he could not now, as he had in the Tractatus,
attempt to ‘conjure up’ something of a higher order with words, with a
theory, he wanted, as it were, to point to it. Just as speech is not
essential in religion, so words cannot be essential to revealing what is
true, or deep, in metaphysics.</p>
<p>Indeed, what is deep in metaphysics, as in magic, is its expression
of a fundamentally religious feeling – the desire to run up against the
limits of our language, which Wittgenstein had spoken of in connection
with ethics, the desire to transcend the boundaries of reason and to
take Kierkegaard’s ‘leap of faith’. This desire in all its
manifestations was something for which Wittgenstein had the deepest
respect, whether in the philosophies of Kierkegaard and Heidegger, the
Confessions of St Augustine, the prayers of Dr Johnson, or the devotion
of monastic orders. Nor was his respect confined to its Christian forms.
All religions are wonderful, he told Drury: ’even those of the most
primitive tribes. The ways in which people express their religious
feelings differ enormously.’2</p>
<p>What Wittgenstein felt was ‘deep’ about magic was precisely that it
is a primitive expression of religious feeling. In connection with this,
he had long wanted to read The Golden Bough, Sir James Frazer’s
monumental account of primitive ritual and magic, and in 1931 Drury
borrowed the first volume from the Cambridge Union library. There are
thirteen volumes in all, but Wittgenstein and Drury, though they read it
together for some weeks, never got beyond a little way into the first
volume, so frequent were Wittgenstein’s interruptions to explain his
disagreements with Frazer’s approach. Nothing could have been more
calculated to arouse his ire than Frazer’s treatment of magical rituals
as though they were early forms of science. The savage who sticks a pin
in an effigy of his enemy does so, according to Frazer, because he has
formed the mistaken scientific hypothesis that this will injure his
opponent. This, on Wittgenstein’s view, was to ‘explain’ something deep
by reducing it to something incomparably more shallow. ‘What narrowness
of life we find in Frazer!’ he exclaimed. ’And as a result: how
impossible for him to understand a different way of life from the
English one of his time!’3</p>
<p>Frazer cannot imagine a priest who is not basically an English parson
of our times with all his stupidity and feebleness …</p>
<p>Frazer is much more savage than most of his savages, for these
savages will not be so far from any understanding of spiritual matters
as an Englishman of the twentieth century. His explanations of the
observances are much cruder than the sense of the observances
themselves.</p>
<p>The wealth of facts which Frazer had collected about these rituals
would, Wittgenstein thought, be more instructive if they were presented
without any kind of theoretical gloss and arranged in such a way that
their relationships with each other – and with our own rituals – could
be shown. We might then say, as Goethe had said of the plant-forms he
had described in Metamorphose der Pflanze: ‘Und so deutet das Chor auf
ein geheimes Gesetz’ (‘And all this points to some unknown law’):</p>
<p>I can set out this law in an hypothesis of evolution, or again, in
analogy with the schema of a plant I can give it the schema of a
religious ceremony, but I can also do it just by arranging the factual
material so that we can easily pass from one part to another and have a
clear view of it – showing it in a perspicuous way.4</p>
<p>For us the conception of a perspicuous presentation is fundamental.
It indicates the form in which we write of things, the way in which we
see things. (A kind of Weltanschauung that seems to be typical of our
time. Spengler.)</p>
<p>This perspicuous presentation makes possible that understanding which
consists just in the fact that we ‘see the connections’.</p>
<p>A morphology of magic rituals would, then, preserve what was deep
about them, without either ridiculing or defending them. It would, in
this way, have ‘the character of magic’. Similarly, Wittgenstein hoped,
his new method of philosophy would preserve what was to be respected in
the old metaphysical theories, and would itself have the character of
metaphysics, without attempting the conjuring tricks of the
Tractatus.</p>
<p>There is an analogy here, too, with Wittgenstein’s projected
autobiography. This, too, he intended, would reveal his essential nature
without any kind of explanation, justification or defence. He took it
for granted that what would be revealed would be an ‘unheroic’, perhaps
even an ‘ugly’, nature. But he was concerned above all that, in laying
his real character bare, he should not deny it, make light of it, or, in
some perverse way, take pride in it:</p>
<p>If I may explain in a simile: If a street loafer were to write his
biography, the danger would be that he would either5</p>
<ol type="a">
<li>deny that his nature was what it is,</li>
</ol>
<p>or (b) would find some reason to be proud of it,</p>
<p>or (c) present the matter as though this – that he has such a nature
– were of no consequence.</p>
<p>In the first case he lies, in the second he mimics a trait of the
natural aristocrat, that pride which is a vitium splendidum and which he
cannot really have any more than a crippled body can have natural grace.
In the third case he makes as it were the gesture of social democracy,
placing culture above the bodily qualities – but this is deception as
well. He is what he is, and this is important and means something but is
no reason for pride, on the other hand it is always the object of his
self-respect. And I can accept the other’s aristocratic pride and his
contempt for my nature, for in this I am only taking account of what my
nature is and of the other man as part of the environment of my nature –
the world with this perhaps ugly object, my person, as its centre.</p>
<p>As Rush Rhees has pointed out, there is something Weiningerian about
Wittgenstein’s conception of writing an autobiography, a conception that
sees it almost as a spiritual duty. ‘Putting together a complete
autobiography’, Weininger writes in Sex and Character, ‘when the need to
do this originates in the man himself, is always the sign of a superior
human being’:6</p>
<p>For in the really faithful memory the root of piety lies. A man of
real character, faced with the proposal or demand that he abandon his
past for some material advantage or his health, would reject it, even if
the prospect were of the greatest treasures in the world or of happiness
itself.</p>
<p>It is in 1931, the year in which his planned autobiography received
its greatest attention, that references to Weininger and Weiningerian
reflections abound in Wittgenstein’s notebooks and conversations. He
recommended Sex and Character to his undergraduate friends, Lee and
Drury, and to Moore. Their response was understandably cool. The work
that had excited the imagination of pre-war Vienna looked, in the cold
light of post-war Cambridge, simply bizarre. Wittgenstein was forced to
explain. ‘I can quite imagine that you don’t admire Weininger very
much’, he wrote to Moore on 28 August, ‘what with that beastly
translation and the fact that W. must feel very foreign to you’:7</p>
<p>It is true that he is fantastic but he is great and fantastic. It
isn’t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the
greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous
mistake which is great. I.e. roughly speaking if you add a ~ to the
whole book it says an important truth.</p>
<p>What he meant by this elliptical remark remains obscure. On the
subject of Weininger’s central theme that women and femininity were the
sources of all evil, Wittgenstein admitted to Drury: ‘How wrong he was,
my God he was wrong.’8 But this hardly reveals the important truth
obtained by negating the whole book. The negation of an absurdity is not
an important truth, but a platitude (‘Women are not the source of all
evil’). Perhaps he meant that Weininger had captured the essential
characteristics of Man and Woman but charged the wrong suspect. In his
dream about ‘Vertsagt’, after all, it is the woman who is the victim,
while the perpetrator of the crime is a man whose very name has
something disagreeably ‘masculine’ about it.</p>
<p>Certainly in his autobiographical notes there is nothing to suggest
that he considered his ‘unheroic’, ‘ugly’ nature to be attributable to
any supposed feminine traits.</p>
<p>There are, however, several remarks that indicate that he was
inclined to accept a Weiningerian conception of Jewishness, and that he
considered at least some of his less heroic characteristics to have
something to do with his Jewish ancestry. Like Weininger, Wittgenstein
was prepared to extend the concept of Jewishness beyond the confines of
such ancestry. Rousseau’s character, for example, he thought ‘has
something Jewish about it’. And, like Weininger, he saw some affinity
between the characteristics of a Jew and those of an Englishman.9 Thus:
‘Mendelssohn is not a peak, but a plateau.10 His Englishness’; ’Tragedy
is something un-Jewish. Mendelssohn is, I suppose, the most untragic of
composers.’11</p>
<p>But – and in this he is also following Weininger – it is clear that
for most of the time when he talks of ‘Jews’ he is thinking of a
particular racial group. Indeed, what is most shocking about
Wittgenstein’s remarks on Jewishness is his use of the language –
indeed, the slogans – of racial anti-Semitism. The echo that really
disturbs is not that of Sex and Character, but that of Mein Kampf. Many
of Hitler’s most outrageous suggestions – his characterization of the
Jew as a parasite ‘who like a noxious bacillus keeps spreading as soon
as a favourable medium invites him’,12 his claim that the Jews’
contribution to culture has been entirely derivative, that ‘the Jew
lacks those qualities which distinguish the races that are creative and
hence culturally blessed’,13 and, furthermore, that this contribution
has been restricted to an intellectual refinement of another’s culture
(‘since the Jew … was never in possession of a culture of his own, the
foundations of his intellectual work were always provided by others’) –
this whole litany of lamentable nonsense finds a parallel in
Wittgenstein’s remarks of 1931.14</p>
<p>Were they not written by Wittgenstein, many of his pronouncements on
the nature of Jews would be understood as nothing more than the rantings
of a fascist anti-Semite. ‘It has sometimes been said’, begins one such
remark, ‘that the Jews’ secretive and cunning nature is a result of
their long persecution’:15</p>
<p>That is certainly untrue; on the other hand it is certain that they
continue to exist despite this persecution only because they have an
inclination towards such secretiveness. As we may say that this or that
animal has escaped extinction only because of its capacity or ability to
conceal itself. Of course I do not mean this as a reason for commending
such a capacity, not by any means.</p>
<p>‘They’ escape extinction only because they avoid detection? And
therefore they are, of necessity, secretive and cunning? This is
anti-Semitic paranoia in its most undiluted form – the fear of, and
distaste for, the devious ‘Jew in our midst’. So is Wittgenstein’s
adoption of the metaphor of illness. ‘Look on this tumour as a perfectly
normal part of your body!’ he imagines somebody suggesting, and counters
with the question: ‘Can one do that, to order? Do I have the power to
decide at will to have, or not to have, an ideal conception of my body?’
He goes on to relate this Hitlerian metaphor to the position of European
Jews: 16</p>
<p>Within the history of the peoples of Europe the history of the Jews
is not treated as their intervention in European affairs would actually
merit, because within this history they are experienced as a sort of
disease, and anomaly, and no one wants to put a disease on the same
level as normal life [and no one wants to speak of a disease as if it
had the same rights as healthy bodily processes (even painful
ones)].</p>
<p>We may say: people can only regard this tumour as a natural part of
their body if their whole feeling for the body changes (if the whole
national feeling for the body changes). Otherwise the best they can do
is put up with it.</p>
<p>You can expect an individual man to display this sort of tolerance,
or else to disregard such things; but you cannot expect this of a
nation, because it is precisely not disregarding such things that makes
it a nation. I.e. there is a contradiction in expecting someone both to
retain his former aesthetic feeling for the body and also to make the
tumour welcome.</p>
<p>Those who seek to drive out the ‘noxious bacillus’ in their midst, he
comes close to suggesting, are right to do so. Or, at least, one cannot
expect them – as a nation – to do otherwise.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that this metaphor makes no sense without a
racial notion of Jewishness. The Jew, however ‘assimilated’, will never
be a German or an Austrian, because he is not of the same ‘body’: he is
experienced by that body as a growth, a disease. The metaphor is
particularly apt to describe the fears of Austrian anti-Semites, because
it implies that the more assimilated the Jews become, the more dangerous
becomes the disease they represent to the otherwise healthy Aryan
nation. Thus it is quite wrong to equate the anti-Semitism implied by
Wittgenstein’s remarks with the ‘Jewish self-hatred’ of Karl Kraus. The
traits which Kraus disliked, and which he took to be Jewish
(acquisitiveness etc.), he attributed not to any racial inheritance but
to the social and religious isolation of the Jews. What he attacked
primarily was the ‘ghetto-mentality’ of the Jews; far from wanting to
keep Jew and non-Jew separate, and regarding the Jew as a ‘tumour’ on
the body of the German people, he campaigned tirelessly for the complete
assimilation of Jews: ‘Through dissolution to salvation!’</p>
<p>From this perspective Kraus was far better placed than Wittgenstein
to understand the horror of Nazi propaganda – and, one might add, more
perceptive in recognizing its intellectual precedents. Wittgenstein, of
course, could see that the Nazis were a barbarous ‘set of gangsters’, as
he once described them to Drury, but at the time he was recommending
Spengler’s Decline of the West to Drury as a book that might teach him
something about the age in which they were living, Kraus was drawing
attention to the affinities between Spengler and the Nazis, commenting
that Spengler understood the Untergangsters of the West – and that they
understood him.17</p>
<p>Though alarming, Wittgenstein’s use of the slogans of racist
anti-Semitism does not, of course, establish any affinity between
himself and the Nazis. His remarks on Jewishness were fundamentally
introspective. They represent a turning inwards of the sense of cultural
decay and the desire for a New Order (which is the path that leads from
Spengler to Hitler) to his own internal state. It is as though, for a
brief time (after 1931 there are, thankfully, no more remarks about
Jewishness in his notebooks), he was attracted to using the then current
language of anti-Semitism as a kind of metaphor for himself (just as, in
the dream of Vertsagt, the image of the Jew that was propagated by the
Nazis – an image of a cunning and deceptive scoundrel who hides behind a
cloak of respectability while committing the most dreadful crimes –
found a ready response in his fears about his own ‘real’ nature). And
just as many Europeans, particularly Germans, felt a need for a New
Order to replace their ‘rotten culture’, so Wittgenstein strived for a
new beginning in his life. His autobiographical notes were essentially
confessional, and ‘a confession’, he wrote in 1931, ‘has to be a part of
your new life’. Before he could begin anew, he had to take stock of the
old.18</p>
<p>What is perhaps most ironic is that, just as Wittgenstein was
beginning to develop an entirely new method for tackling philosophical
problems – a method that has no precedent in the entire tradition of
Western philosophy (unless one finds a place for Goethe and Spengler in
that tradition) – he should be inclined to assess his own philosophical
contribution within the framework of the absurd charge that the Jew was
incapable of original thought. ‘It is typical for a Jewish mind’, he
wrote, ’to understand someone else’s work better than [that person]
understands it himself.’19 His own work, for example, was essentially a
clarification of other people’s ideas:</p>
<p>Amongst Jews ‘genius’ is found only in the holy man. Even the
greatest of Jewish thinkers is no more than talented.20 (Myself for
instance.) I think there is some truth in my idea that I really only
think reproductively. I don’t believe I have ever invented a line of
thinking. I have always taken one over from someone else. I have simply
straightaway seized on it with enthusiasm for my work of clarification.
That is how Boltzmann, Hertz, Schopenhauer, Frege, Russell, Kraus, Loos,
Weininger, Spengler, Sraffa have influenced me. Can one take the case of
Breuer and Freud as an example of Jewish reproductiveness? – What I
invent are new similes.</p>
<p>This belittling of his own achievement may have been a way of
guarding himself from his own pride – from believing that he really was,
as he once lightheartedly described himself in a letter to Pattisson,
‘the greatest philosopher that ever lived’. He was acutely aware of the
dangers of false pride. ‘Often, when I have had a picture well framed or
have hung it in the right surroundings’, he wrote, ‘I have caught myself
feeling as proud as if I had painted it myself.’21 And it was against
the background of such pride that he felt forced to remind himself of
his limitations, of his ‘Jewishness’:</p>
<p>The Jew must see to it that, in a literal sense, ‘all things are as
nothing to him’. But this is particularly hard for him, since in a sense
he has nothing that is particularly his.22 It is much harder to accept
poverty willingly when you have to be poor than when you might also be
rich.</p>
<p>It might be said (rightly or wrongly) that the Jewish mind does not
have the power to produce even the tiniest flower or blade of grass that
has grown in the soil of another’s mind and to put it into a
comprehensive picture. We aren’t pointing to a fault when we say this
and everything is all right as long as what is being done is quite
clear. It is only when the nature of a Jewish work is confused with that
of a non-Jewish work that there is any danger, especially when the
author of the Jewish work falls into the confusion himself, as he so
easily may. (Doesn’t he look as proud as though he had produced the milk
himself?)</p>
<p>So long as he lived, Wittgenstein never ceased to struggle against
his own pride, and to express doubts about his philosophical achievement
and his own moral decency. After 1931, however, he dropped the language
of anti-Semitism as a means of expressing those doubts.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s remarks on Jewishness, like his projected
autobiography, were essentially confessional, and both seem in some way
linked to the ‘sacred’ union he had planned for himself and Marguerite.
They coincide with the year in which his intention to marry Marguerite
was pursued with its greatest earnestness.</p>
<p>Early in the summer he invited Marguerite to Norway, to prepare, as
he thought, for their future life together. He intended, however, that
they should spend their time separately, each taking advantage of the
isolation to engage in serious contemplation, so that they would be
spiritually ready for the new life that was to come.</p>
<p>Accordingly, while he stayed in his own house, he arranged lodgings
for Marguerite at the farmhouse of Anna Rebni, a tough seventy-year-old
woman who lived with her hundred-year-old mother. During the two weeks
she spent there, Marguerite saw very little of Wittgenstein. When she
arrived at the farmhouse, she unpacked her bags to find a Bible which
Wittgenstein had slipped in there, together with a letter, significantly
tucked into Corinthians I 13 – St Paul’s discourse on the nature and
virtue of love. It was a heavy hint that she did not take. Instead of
meditating, praying and reading the Bible – which is how Wittgenstein
spent much of his time – she did what Pinsent had done in 1913, and made
the best she could of what little Skjolden had to offer in the way of
entertainment. She took walks around the farm, went swimming in the
fjord, got to know the villagers and learnt a little Norwegian. After
two weeks she left for Rome to attend her sister’s wedding, determined
that the one man she was not going to marry was Ludwig Wittgenstein. Not
only did she feel she could never rise to meet the demands a life with
Wittgenstein would present; also, and equally important, she knew
Wittgenstein would never be able to give her the sort of life she
wanted. He had made it clear, for example, that he had absolutely no
intention of having children, thinking that to do so would simply be to
bring another person into a life of misery.</p>
<p>For some of his time in Norway, Wittgenstein was joined by Gilbert
Pattisson, whose visit overlapped by about a week that of Marguerite,
and who no doubt did something to lighten Wittgenstein’s mood during the
three weeks that he was there – although, as usual, Pattisson found it
necessary to get away from Wittgenstein from time to time, taking
himself to Oslo for a night to ‘paint the town red’.</p>
<p>The visit to Norway may have put an end to any idea there might have
been of Wittgenstein’s marrying Marguerite, but it did not (or not
immediately) result in a breaking off of friendship. For three weeks
during the late summer of 1931 they saw each other almost every day at
the Hochreit, where Wittgenstein stayed, as before, at the woodman’s
cottage on the edge of the estate, while Marguerite was a guest of
Gretl’s at the family residence. In a volume of reminiscences written
for her grandchildren, she comments, in a phrase that recalls the role
of David Pinsent: ’My presence brought him the peace which he needed
while he was nurturing his ideas.’23</p>
<p>At the Hochreit Wittgenstein worked on the completion of his book,
which at this time had the working title of Philosophical Grammar, a
title he admitted might have the smell of a textbook, ‘but that doesn’t
matter, for behind it there is the book’.24</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had a peculiarly laborious method of editing his work.
He began by writing remarks into small notebooks. He then selected what
he considered to be the best of these remarks and wrote them out,
perhaps in a different order, into large manuscript volumes. From these
he made a further selection, which he dictated to a typist. The
resultant typescript was then used as the basis for a further selection,
sometimes by cutting it up and rearranging it – and then the whole
process was started again. Though this process continued for more than
twenty years, it never culminated in an arrangement with which
Wittgenstein was fully satisfied, and so his literary executors have had
to publish either what they consider to be the most satisfactory of the
various manuscripts and typescripts (Philosophical Remarks,
Philosophical Investigations, Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology),
or a selection from them (or rearrangement of them) made by the
executors themselves (Philosophical Grammar, Remarks on the Foundations
of Mathematics, Culture and Value, Zettel). These we now know as the
works of the later Wittgenstein, though in truth not one of them can be
regarded as a completed work.</p>
<p>For this frustrating circumstance we can blame the fastidiousness
about publication that had so infuriated Russell in 1913, and was soon
to exasperate even further the unfortunate Friedrich Waismann. For in
1931, as Wittgenstein was just beginning to formulate some sort of
satisfactory presentation of his new thought, Waismann was under the
impression that his own presentation of Wittgenstein’s ideas, the book
that had been announced in 1929 under the title of Logik, Sprache,
Philosophie, was nearing completion. On 10 September Schlick wrote to
Waismann from California, commenting that he assumed the book would be
ready for publication soon and that it would appear in print by the time
he returned to Vienna the following Easter.</p>
<p>Waismann, however, had seen little of Wittgenstein that summer.
Shortly before the end of the vacation, Wittgenstein met him in Vienna
to present him with the latest typescripts to have been culled from his
recent work. They discussed the changes in the proposed book that would
have to be made in the light of this new work, and, on the basis of
these discussions, Waismann rewrote his ‘Theses’ and sent the new
version to Schlick. Wittgenstein, meanwhile, was becoming increasingly
concerned that Waismann might misrepresent his new thoughts. In November
he wrote to Schlick about ‘this Waismann thing’, and apologized for
keeping him waiting for a final edition. He stressed that he wanted to
honour his obligations to Schlick, but: ’For the thing itself I have no
enthusiasm. I am convinced that Waismann would present many things in a
form completely different to what I regard as correct.’25</p>
<p>The central problem was that the book as originally conceived was now
redundant. Wittgenstein’s ideas had changed so fundamentally that he
could no longer present them in a form that was essentially an updated
version of the Tractatus. ‘There are’, he told Schlick, ‘very, very many
statements in the book with which I now disagree!’ The Tractatus talk
about ‘elementary propositions’ and ‘objects’ had, he said, been shown
to be erroneous, and there was no point in publishing a work that simply
repeated the old mistakes.26 The Tractatus analysis of the proposition
must be replaced by a ‘perspicuous representation’ of grammar which
would throw overboard ‘all the dogmatic things that I said about
“objects”, “elementary propositions” etc.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein next met Waismann during the Christmas vacation of 1931,
and it was then that he made clear to him his view that the whole
conception of the book would have to be changed. He explained the
implications of his new thinking for the status of philosophical
theses:</p>
<p>If there were theses in philosophy, they would have to be such that
they do not give rise to disputes.27 For they would have to be put in
such a way that everyone would say, Oh yes, that is of course obvious.
As long as there is a possibility of having different opinions and
disputing about a question, this indicates that things have not yet been
expressed clearly enough. Once a perfectly clear formulation – ultimate
clarity – has been reached, there can be no second thoughts or
reluctance any more, for these always arise from the feeling that
something has now been asserted, and I do not yet know whether I should
admit it or not. If, however, you make the grammar clear to yourself, if
you proceed by very short steps in such a way that every single step
becomes perfectly obvious and natural, no dispute whatsoever can arise.
Controversy always arises through leaving out or failing to state
clearly certain steps, so that the impression is given that a claim has
been made that could be disputed.</p>
<p>About the Tractatus, he told Waismann that in it he had ‘still
proceeded dogmatically … I saw something from far away and in a very
indefinite manner, and I wanted to elicit from it as much as
possible.’28 ‘But’, he added firmly, ‘a rehash of such theses is no
longer justified.’ He insisted that notes taken by Waismann of this
discussion should be sent to Schlick in California, and that Waismann
should inform Schlick of the change in plan and explain the reasons for
it.</p>
<p>When Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge in the new year of 1932 he
wrote to Schlick asking whether he had received Waismann’s notes, and
whether he could ‘make head or tail of it’. Schlick evidently thought he
could, for he persisted in encouraging Waismann to continue with the
project. Like Wittgenstein, Waismann did so for Schlick’s sake.29 For
‘the thing’ itself, we can assume that he had no more enthusiasm than
Wittgenstein. The following Easter, his already unenviable position was
made even more difficult when Wittgenstein proposed a new procedure:
instead of Waismann receiving material for the book directly from
Wittgenstein, he was to be dependent on Schlick for typescripts that
Wittgenstein would send to him. Wittgenstein had, in other words,
completely lost faith in Waismann as a communicator of his ideas;
Waismann was no longer, for example, given the responsibility of
presenting Wittgenstein’s new ideas to the members of the Vienna
Circle.</p>
<p>Almost all of Wittgenstein’s energies were by now devoted to
producing his own presentation of his new thoughts. He experimented with
many different formulations – numbered remarks, numbered paragraphs, an
annotated table of contents etc. In his lectures, as though to orientate
himself within the Western tradition, he went through C. D. Broad’s
taxonomy of philosophical styles and theories, given in Broad’s own
series of undergraduate lectures, ‘Elements of Philosophy’. The method
of Hume and Descartes, he rejected, but said of Kant’s critical method:
‘This is the right sort of approach.’ With regard to the distinction
between the deductive and dialectical methods of speculative philosophy
– the first represented by Descartes, the second by Hegel – he came
down, with reservations, on the side of Hegel:30</p>
<p>… the dialectical method is very sound and a way in which we do work.
But it should not try to find, from two propositions, a and b, a further
more complex proposition, as Broad’s description implied. Its object
should be to find out where the ambiguities in our language are.31</p>
<p>Of Broad’s three ‘theories of truth’ – the Correspondence Theory, the
Coherence Theory and the Pragmatic Theory – he was dismissive:
‘Philosophy is not a choice between different “theories”’:32</p>
<p>We can say that the word [‘truth’] has at least three different
meanings; but it is mistaken to assume that any one of these theories
can give the whole grammar of how we use the word, or endeavour to fit
into a single theory cases which do not seem to agree with it.</p>
<p>What replaces theory is grammar. During this series of lectures Moore
made a spirited attempt to insist that Wittgenstein was using the word
‘grammar’ in a rather odd sense. He presented to Wittgenstein’s class a
paper distinguishing what he took to be the usual meaning from its
Wittgensteinian use. Thus, he argued, the sentence: ‘Three men was
working’ is incontrovertibly a misuse of grammar, but it is not clear
that: ‘Different colours cannot be in the same place in a visual field
at the same time’ commits a similar transgression. If this latter is
also called a misuse of grammar, then ‘grammar’ must mean something
different in each case. No, replied Wittgenstein. ‘The right expression
is “It does not have sense to say …”’ Both kinds of rules were rules in
the same sense. ‘It is just that some have been the subject of
philosophical discussion and some have not’:33</p>
<p>Grammatical rules are all of the same kind, but it is not the same
mistake if a man breaks one as if he breaks another.34 If he uses ‘was’
instead of ‘were’ it causes no confusion; but in the other example the
analogy with physical space (c.f. two people in the same chair) does
cause confusion. When we say we can’t think of two colours in the same
place, we make the mistake of thinking that this is a proposition,
though it is not; and we would never try to say it if we were not misled
by an analogy. It is misleading to use the word ‘can’t’ because it
suggests a wrong analogy. We should say, ‘It has no sense to say …’</p>
<p>The grammatical mistakes of philosophers, then, differed from the
ordinary mistakes mentioned by Moore only in being more pernicious. To
study these mistakes was, therefore, pointless – indeed, it was worse
than that, and could only do harm; the point was not to study them, but
to free oneself from them. Thus, to one of his students, Karl Britton,
Wittgenstein insisted that he could not take philosophy seriously so
long as he was reading for a degree in the subject. He urged him to give
up the degree and do something else. When Britton refused, Wittgenstein
only hoped that it would not kill his interest in philosophy.</p>
<p>Similarly, he urged Britton, as he urged most of his students, to
avoid becoming a teacher of philosophy. There was only one thing worse,
and that was becoming a journalist. Britton should do a real job, and
work with ordinary people. Academic life was detestable. When he
returned from London, he told Britton, he would overhear one
undergraduate talking to another, saying, ‘Oh, really!’ and know that he
was back in Cambridge. The gossip of his bedmaker in college was much
preferable to the insincere cleverness of high table.</p>
<p>Maurice Drury had already taken Wittgenstein’s advice, and was
working with a group of unemployed shipbuilders in Newcastle. As the
project neared its completion, however, he was tempted into applying for
a post as a lecturer in philosophy at Armstrong College, Newcastle. In
the event, the post was given to Dorothy Emmett, and Drury went to South
Wales to help run a communal market garden for unemployed miners. ‘You
owe a great debt to Miss Emmett’, Wittgenstein insisted; ’she saved you
from becoming a professional philosopher.’35</p>
<p>Despite this contempt for the profession, Wittgenstein kept a jealous
and watchful eye on the use to which his ideas were put by academic
philosophers, and in the summer of 1932 was involved in what amounts to
a Prioritätstreit with Rudolf Carnap. It was occasioned by an article by
Carnap entitled ‘Die physikalische Sprache als Universalsprache der
Wissenschaft’, which was published in Erkenntnis, the journal of the
Vienna Circle (it was later published in English, as The Unity of
Science). The article is an argument for ‘physicalism’ – the view that
all statements, in so far as they are worthy of inclusion into a
scientific study, are ultimately reducible to the language of physics,
whether the science concerned treats of physical, biological,
psychological or social phenomena. It is indebted, as Carnap
acknowledges, to the views of Otto Neurath, the most rigorously
positivist of the Vienna Circle philosophers.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, however, was convinced that Carnap had used the ideas
he himself had expressed in conversations with the Vienna Circle, and
had done so without proper acknowledgement. In August 1932, in two
letters to Schlick and again in a letter to Carnap himself, Wittgenstein
insists that his annoyance at Carnap’s article is a purely ethical and
personal matter, and is in no way to do with a concern to establish his
authorship of the thoughts published by Carnap, or with his anxiety
about his reputation within the academic community. On 8 August he wrote
to Schlick:</p>
<p>… from the bottom of my heart it is all the same to me what the
professional philosophers of today think of me; for it is not for them
that I am writing.36</p>
<p>And yet his point was that the ideas published under Carnap’s name –
about, for example, ostensive definition and the nature of hypotheses –
were properly speaking his ideas. Carnap took them, he alleged, from
records of his conversations with Waismann. When Carnap replied that his
central argument was concerned with physicalism, about which
Wittgenstein had said nothing, Wittgenstein objected that the basic idea
was to be found in the Tractatus: ’That I had not dealt with the
question of “physicalism” is untrue (only not under that – horrible –
name), and [I did so] with the brevity with which the whole of the
Tractatus is written.’37</p>
<p>With the publication of Carnap’s article Wittgenstein’s philosophical
conversations with Waismann finally came to an end. Their last recorded
discussion, indeed, is taken up with an attempt by Wittgenstein to
refute Carnap’s suggestion that his (Carnap’s) conception of a
hypothesis was taken from Poincaré, rather than from Wittgenstein
himself. After that, Waismann was not to be trusted with privileged
access to Wittgenstein’s new ideas.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s growing distrust of Waismann, and his pique at what he
saw as Carnap’s impertinence, coincided with renewed efforts on his part
to compose a publishable presentation of his work.</p>
<p>During his sojourn at the Hochreit during the summer of 1932, he
dictated to a typist a large selection of remarks from the eight
manuscript volumes he had written during the previous two years. (In the
letter to Schlick of 8 August he mentions that he is spending up to
seven hours a day in dictation.) The result was what has become known to
Wittgenstein scholars as ‘the Big Typescript’. This, more than any of
the other typescripts left by Wittgenstein, presents the appearance of a
finished book, complete with chapter headings and a table of contents,
and forms the basis of what has been published as Philosophical Grammar.
It is, however, by no means identical with the published text.</p>
<p>In particular, an interesting chapter entitled ‘Philosophy’ has been
omitted from the published version. ‘All that philosophy can do’, he
says there, ‘is to destroy idols.’38 ‘And’, he adds, in a swipe at the
Vienna Circle, ‘that means not making any new ones – say out of “the
absence of idols”.’ It is not in practical life that we encounter
philosophical problems, he stresses, but, rather, when we are misled by
certain analogies in language to ask things like ‘What is time?’, ‘What
is a number?’ etc. These questions are insoluble, not because of their
depth and profundity, but rather because they are nonsensical – a misuse
of language. Thus:</p>
<p>The real discovery is the one that makes me capable of stopping doing
philosophy when I want to – the one that gives philosophy peace, so that
it is no longer tormented by questions which bring itself in question. –
Instead, we now demonstrate a method, by examples; and the series of
examples can be broken off. – Problems are solved (difficulties
eliminated), not a single problem … ‘But then we will never come to the
end of our job!’ Of course not, because it has no end.</p>
<p>This conception of philosophy, which sees it as a task of
clarification that has no end, and only an arbitrary beginning, makes it
almost impossible to imagine how a satisfactory book on philosophy can
be written. It is no wonder that Wittgenstein used to quote with
approval Schopenhauer’s dictum that a book on philosophy, with a
beginning and an end, is a sort of contradiction. And it comes as no
surprise that, almost as soon as he had finished dictating the Big
Typescript, he began to make extensive revisions to it. The section he
revised least, however, was that on the philosophy of mathematics (hence
the complete reproduction of those chapters in Philosophical Grammar).
It is unfortunate that his work in that area has not received the same
attention as have his remarks on language.</p>
<p>Not only did Wittgenstein himself regard his work on mathematics as
his most important contribution to philosophy; it is also in this work
that it is most apparent how radically his philosophical perspective
differs from that of the professional philosophy of the twentieth
century. It is here that we can see most clearly the truth of his
conviction that he was working against the stream of modern
civilization. For the target at which his remarks are aimed is not a
particular view of mathematics that has been held by this or that
philosopher; it is, rather, a conception of the subject that is held
almost universally among working mathematicians, and that has, moreover,
been dominant throughout our entire culture for more than a century –
the view, that is, that sees mathematics as a science.</p>
<p>‘Confusions in these matters’, he writes in the Big Typescript, ‘are
entirely the result of treating mathematics as a kind of natural
science’:39</p>
<p>And this is connected with the fact that mathematics has detached
itself from natural science; for, as long as it is done in immediate
connection with physics, it is clear that it isn’t a natural science.
(Similarly, you can’t mistake a broom for part of the furnishing of a
room as long as you use it to clean the furniture.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics is not a contribution to the
debate on the foundations of the subject that was fought during the
first half of this century by the opposing camps of logicists (led by
Frege and Russell), formalists (led by Hilbert) and intuitionists (led
by Brouwer and Weyl). It is, instead, an attempt to undermine the whole
basis of this debate – to undermine the idea that mathematics needs
foundations. All the branches of mathematics that were inspired by this
search for ‘foundations’ – Set Theory, Proof Theory, Quantificational
Logic, Recursive Function Theory, etc. – he regarded as based on a
philosophical confusion. Thus:</p>
<p>Philosophical clarity will have the same effect on the growth of
mathematics as sunlight has on the growth of potato shoots.40 (In a dark
cellar they grow yards long.)</p>
<p>Wittgenstein knew, of course, that with regard to mathematics, if not
with regard to his entire philosophical enterprise, he was tilting at
windmills. ‘Nothing seems to me less likely’, he wrote, ’than that a
scientist or mathematician who reads me should be seriously influenced
in the way he works.’41 If, as he repeatedly emphasized, he was not
writing for professional philosophers, still less was he writing for
professional mathematicians.</p>
