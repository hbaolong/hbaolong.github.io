<h4 id="russells-protégé">3 RUSSELL’S PROTÉGÉ</h4>
<p>AT THE END of the summer vacation of 1911 Wittgenstein, having drawn
up a plan of his projected book on philosophy, travelled to Jena to
discuss it with Frege – presumably with a view to finding out whether it
was worth going on with, or whether he should instead continue with his
work in aeronautical research. Hermine Wittgenstein knew Frege to be an
old man and was anxious about the visit, fearing that he would not have
the patience to deal with the situation, or the understanding to realize
the momentous importance the meeting had for her brother. In the event,
so Wittgenstein later told friends, Frege ‘wiped the floor’ with him –
one reason, perhaps, why nothing of this proposed work has survived.1
Frege was, however, sufficiently encouraging to recommend to
Wittgenstein that he go to Cambridge to study under Bertrand
Russell.</p>
<p>The advice was more propitious than Frege could have known, and was
not only to lead to a decisive turning point in Wittgenstein’s life, but
also to have a tremendous influence on Russell’s. For at the very time
when Wittgenstein needed a mentor, Russell needed a protégé.</p>
<p>The year 1911 was something of a watershed in Russell’s life. He had,
in the previous year, finished Principia Mathematica, the product of ten
years of exhausting labour. ‘My intellect never quite recovered from the
strain’, he writes in his Autobiography.2 ‘I have been ever since
definitely less capable of dealing with difficult abstractions than I
was before.’ With the completion of Principia Russell’s life, both
personally and philosophically, entered a new phase. In the spring of
1911 he fell in love with Ottoline Morrell, the aristocratic wife of the
Liberal MP Phillip Morrell, and began an affair that was to last until
1916. During the height of his passion he wrote Ottoline as many as
three letters a day. These letters contain an almost daily record of
Russell’s reactions to Wittgenstein – a record which provides a useful
corrective to some of the anecdotes he told about Wittgenstein in his
later years, when his love of a good story frequently got the better of
his concern for accuracy.</p>
<p>Partly under the influence of Ottoline, and partly from the
debilitating effect of finishing Principia, Russell’s work in philosophy
began to change. His first work after Principia was The Problems of
Philosophy, his ‘shilling shocker’, the first of many popular works and
the book that first revealed his remarkable gift for the lucid
expression of difficult ideas. At the same time he took up the post of
lecturer in mathematical logic at Trinity College. His teaching and his
work on a book popularizing his thought – together with the fact that
Principia had left him exhausted – combined to persuade him that from
now on his chief task in the development of the ideas of Principia lay
in encouraging others to continue from where he had left off. At the end
of 1911 he wrote to Ottoline: ’I did think the technical philosophy that
remains for me to do very important indeed.’3 But now:</p>
<p>I have an uneasiness about philosophy altogether; what remains for me
to do in philosophy (I mean in technical philosophy) does not seem of
first-rate importance. The shilling shocker really seems to me better
worth doing … I think really the important thing is to make the ideas I
have intelligible.</p>
<p>The influence of Ottoline during this time is most clearly seen in
Russell’s plans for a book on religion, to be called Prisons, which he
began while he was still finishing The Problems of Philosophy, and which
he abandoned some time in 1912. The title of the work comes from a line
in Hamlet – ‘The world’s a prison and Denmark one of the worst wards’ –
and its central idea was that ‘the religion of contemplation’ could
provide the means of escape out of the prisons into which we enclose
human life. By ‘the religion of contemplation’ Russell did not mean a
belief in God or immortality – even his infatuation with the deeply
religious Ottoline could not persuade him to believe in those. He meant,
rather, a mystical union with the universe in which our finite selves
are overcome and we become at one with infinity. For, as he told
Ottoline (with dubious accuracy), ’What you call God is very much what I
call infinity.’4</p>
<p>The project might plausibly be seen as an attempt by Russell to
reconcile his own sceptical agnosticism with Ottoline’s devout faith.
The central conceit of the book reappears in a letter to Ottoline
describing the liberating effect of her love for him:</p>
<p>… now there is no prison for me.5 I reach out to the stars,
andandandand through the ages, andandandand everywhere the radiance of
your love lights the world for me.</p>
<p>The Russell Wittgenstein met in 1911, then, was far from being the
strident rationalist, the offender of the faith, he later became. He was
a man in the grip of romance, more appreciative than he had been before,
or was to become, of the irrational and emotional side of human
character – even to the extent of adopting a kind of transcendental
mysticism. Perhaps more important, he was a man who, having decided that
his contribution to technical philosophy was finished, was looking for
someone with the youth, vitality and ability to build upon the work
which he had begun.</p>
<p>There are some indications that Wittgenstein was initially inclined
to ignore Frege’s advice and to continue with his work at Manchester.
Thus we find him still listed as a research student in engineering for
the start of the autumn term, his studentship having been renewed for
the coming year. It may be that, having been floored by Frege in
argument, he had resolved to overcome his obsession with the philosophy
of mathematics and to persist with his vocation as an engineer.</p>
<p>He had not, apparently, made any prior arrangement with Russell,
when, on 18 October – about two weeks into the Michaelmas term – he
suddenly appeared at Russell’s rooms in Trinity College to introduce
himself.</p>
<p>Russell was having tea with C. K. Ogden (later to become the first
translator of Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus) when:</p>
<p>… an unknown German appeared, speaking very little English but
refusing to speak German. He turned out to be a man who had learned
engineering at Charlottenburg, but during his course had acquired, by
himself, a passion for the philosophy of mathematics andandandand has
now come to Cambridge on purpose to hear me.6</p>
<p>Two omissions in Wittgenstein’s self-introduction are immediately
striking. The first is that he does not mention that he had been advised
to come to Russell by Frege. The second is that he omits to tell Russell
he had studied (indeed, officially, was studying) engineering at
Manchester. These omissions, though strange, are perhaps indicative of
nothing more than Wittgenstein’s extreme nervousness; if Russell had the
impression that he spoke very little English, he must indeed have been
in quite a state.</p>
<p>From what we know of the weeks that followed, it seems to have been
Wittgenstein’s intention not simply to hear Russell lecture, but to
impress himself upon him, with a view to finding out, once and for all –
from the horse’s mouth, as it were – whether he had any genuine talent
for philosophy, and therefore whether he would be justified in
abandoning his aeronautical research.</p>
<p>Russell’s lectures on mathematical logic attracted very few students,
and he often lectured to just three people: C. D. Broad, E. H. Neville
and H. T. J. Norton. He therefore had reason to feel pleased when, on
the day he first met Wittgenstein, he found him ‘duly established’ at
his lecture. ‘I am much interested in my German’, he wrote to Ottoline,
‘andandandand shall hope to see a lot of him.’ As it turned out, he saw
a lot more of him than he had bargained for.7 For four weeks
Wittgenstein plagued Russell – dominating the discussions during the
lectures, and following him back to his rooms after them, still arguing
his position. Russell reacted to this with a mixture of appreciative
interest and impatient exasperation:</p>
<p>My German friend threatens to be an infliction, he came back with me
after my lecture andandandand argued till dinner-time – obstinate
andandandand perverse, but I think not stupid.8 [19.10.11]</p>
<p>My German engineer very argumentative andandandand tiresome. He
wouldn’t admit that it was certain that there was not a rhinoceros in
the room … [He] came back and argued all the time I was dressing.9
[1.11.11 ]</p>
<p>My German engineer, I think, is a fool.10 He thinks nothing empirical
is knowable – I asked him to admit that there was not a rhinoceros in
the room, but he wouldn’t. [2.11.11]</p>
<p>[Wittgenstein] was refusing to admit the existence of anything except
asserted propositions.11 [7.11.11]</p>
<p>My lecture went off all right. My German ex-engineer, as usual,
maintained his thesis that there is nothing in the world except asserted
propositions, but at last I told him it was too large a theme.12
[13.11.11]</p>
<p>My ferocious German came and argued at me after my lecture. He is
armour-plated against all assaults of reasoning. It is really rather a
waste of time talking with him.13 [16.11.11]</p>
<p>In later life Russell made great play of these discussions and
claimed he had looked under all the tables and chairs in the lecture
room in an effort to convince Wittgenstein that there was no rhinoceros
present. But it is clear that for Wittgenstein the issue was
metaphysical rather than empirical, to do with what kind of things make
up the world rather than the presence or otherwise of a rhinoceros. In
fact, the view that he is here so tenaciously advancing prefigures that
expressed in the famous first proposition of the Tractatus: ‘The world
is the totality of facts, not of things.’</p>
<p>It will be seen from the above extracts that Russell had, as yet, no
great conviction of Wittgenstein’s philosophical ability. And yet the
responsibility for Wittgenstein’s future was soon to rest with him. On
27 November, at the end of the Michaelmas term, Wittgenstein came to
Russell to seek his opinion on the question that mattered to him above
all else, the answer to which would determine his choice of career and
finally settle the conflict of interests with which he had struggled for
over two years:</p>
<p>My German is hesitating between philosophy and aviation; he asked me
today whether I thought he was utterly hopeless at philosophy, and I
told him I didn’t know but I thought not.14 I asked him to bring me
something written to help me judge. He has money, and is quite
passionately interested in philosophy, but he feels he ought not to give
his life to it unless he is some good. I feel the responsibility rather
as I really don’t know what to think of his ability. [27.11.11]</p>
<p>Before he left Cambridge, Wittgenstein met Russell socially and, for
once, was relaxed enough in Russell’s company to reveal something of
himself apart from his all-consuming involvement with philosophical
problems. Russell finally discovered that he was Austrian rather than
German, and also that he was ‘literary, very musical, pleasant-mannered
… and, I think really intelligent’.15 The consequence of which was: ‘I
am getting to like him.’</p>
<p>The real turning point, however, came when Wittgenstein returned to
Cambridge in January 1912 with a manuscript he had written during the
vacation. On reading it, Russell’s attitude towards him changed
immediately. It was, he told Ottoline, ‘very good, much better than my
English pupils do’, adding: ‘I shall certainly encourage him. Perhaps he
will do great things.’16 Wittgenstein later told David Pinsent that
Russell’s encouragement had proved his salvation, and had ended nine
years of loneliness and suffering, during which he had continually
thought of suicide. It enabled him finally to give up engineering, and
to brush aside ‘a hint that he was de trop in this world’ – a hint that
had previously made him feel ashamed he had not killed himself. The
implication is that, in encouraging him to pursue philosophy and in
justifying his inclination to abandon engineering, Russell had, quite
literally, saved Wittgenstein’s life.</p>
<p>Over the next term Wittgenstein pursued his studies in mathematical
logic with such vigour that, by the end of it, Russell was to say that
he had learnt all he had to teach, and, indeed, had gone further. ‘Yes’,
he declared to Ottoline, ‘Wittgenstein has been a great event in my life
– whatever may come of it’:17</p>
<p>I love him andandandand feel he will solve the problems I am too old
to solve – all kinds of problems that are raised by my work, but want a
fresh mind and the vigour of youth. He is the young man one hopes
for.</p>
<p>After supervising him for just one term, Russell had identified in
Wittgenstein the protégé he was looking for.</p>
<p>What philosophical work Wittgenstein actually did during the three
months of this term, we do not know. Russell’s letters to Ottoline
contain only the most tantalizing hints. On 26 January Wittgenstein
proposed: ‘a definition of logical form as opposed to logical matter’.18
A month later he: ‘brought a very good original suggestion, which I
think is right, on an important point of logic’.19 These hints, though,
are enough to suggest that Wittgenstein’s work was, from the beginning,
not directed to the problem: ‘What is mathematics?’ but to the still
more fundamental question: ‘What is logic?’ This, Russell himself felt,
was the most important question left unanswered by Principia.</p>
<p>On 1 February 1912 Wittgenstein was admitted as a member of Trinity
College, with Russell as his supervisor. Knowing that he had never
received any formal tuition in logic, and feeling that he might benefit
from it, Russell arranged for him to be ‘coached’ by the eminent
logician and Fellow of King’s College, W. E. Johnson. The arrangement
lasted only a few weeks. Wittgenstein later told F. R. Leavis: ’I found
in the first hour that he had nothing to teach me.’20 Leavis was also
told by Johnson: ’At our first meeting he was teaching me.’21 The
difference is that Johnson’s remark was sardonic, Wittgenstein’s
completely in earnest. It was actually Johnson who put an end to the
arrangement, thus providing Russell with the first of many occasions on
which he had to use all his tact and sensitivity to point out
Wittgenstein’s faults to him without upsetting him:</p>
<p>While I was preparing my speech Wittgenstein appeared in a great
state of excitement because Johnson (with whom I had advised him to
coach) wrote and said he wouldn’t take him any more, practically saying
he argued too much instead of learning his lesson like a good boy.22 He
came to me to know what truth there was in Johnson’s feeling. Now he is
terribly persistent, hardly lets one get a word in, and is generally
considered a bore. As I really like him very much, I was able to hint
these things to him without offending him.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein made quite a different impression on G. E. Moore, whose
lectures he began to attend during this term. ‘Moore thinks enormously
highly of Wittgenstein’s brains’, Russell told Ottoline; ‘– says he
always feels W.23 must be right when they disagree. He says during his
lectures W. always looks frightfully puzzled, but nobody else does. I am
glad to be confirmed in my high opinion of W. – the young men don’t
think much of him, or if they do it is only because Moore and I praise
him.’ For Wittgenstein’s part, he ‘said how much he loves Moore, how he
likes and dislikes people for the way they think – Moore has one of the
most beautiful smiles I know, and it had struck him’.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s friendship with Moore was to develop later. But, with
Russell, an affectionate bond quickly developed. Russell’s admiration
knew no bounds. He saw in Wittgenstein the ‘ideal pupil’, one who ‘gives
passionate admiration with vehement and very intelligent dissent’.24 As
opposed to Broad, who was the most reliable pupil he had had –
‘practically certain to do a good deal of useful but not brilliant
work’25 – Wittgenstein was ‘full of boiling passion which may drive him
anywhere’.26</p>
<p>Russell came increasingly to identify with Wittgenstein, to see in
him a fellow-spirit, one who brought all his force and passion to bear
on theoretical questions. ‘It is a rare passion and one is glad to find
it.’27 Indeed: ‘he has more passion about philosophy than I have; his
avalanches make mine seem mere snowballs’.28 Again and again, one comes
across the word ‘passion’ in Russell’s descriptions: ‘a pure
intellectual passion’ that Wittgenstein (like Russell himself) had ‘in
the highest degree’; ‘it makes me love him’. It was almost as though he
saw in Wittgenstein a mirror image of himself – or, perhaps more
apposite, as though he saw him as his own offspring:</p>
<p>His disposition is that of an artist, intuitive and moody.29 He says
every morning he begins his work with hope, and every evening he ends in
despair – he has just the sort of rage when he can’t understand things
that I have. [16.3.12]</p>
<p>I have the most perfect intellectual sympathy with him – the same
passion and vehemence, the same feeling that one must understand or die,
the sudden jokes breaking down the frightful tension of thought.30
[17.3.12]</p>
<p>… he even has the same similes as I have – a wall parting him from
the truth which he must pull down somehow.31 After our last discussion,
he said ‘Well, there’s a bit of wall pulled down.’</p>
<p>His attitude justifies all I have hoped about my work. [22.3.12]</p>
<p>Russell noted with approval that Wittgenstein had excellent manners,
but, even more approvingly, that: ‘in argument he forgets about manners
andandandand simply says what he thinks’:32</p>
<p>No one could be more sincere than Wittgenstein, or more destitute of
the false politeness that interferes with truth; but he lets his
feelings and affections appear, and it warms one’s heart. [10.3.12]</p>
<p>When, for example, Wittgenstein met a student who happened to be a
monk, Russell could report gleefully to Ottoline that he was ‘far more
terrible with Christians than I am’:33</p>
<p>He had liked F., the undergraduate monk, and was horrified to learn
that he is a monk. F. came to tea with him and W. at once attacked him –
as I imagine, with absolute fury. Yesterday he returned to the charge,
not arguing but only preaching honesty. He abominates ethics and morals
generally; he is deliberately a creature of impulse and thinks one
should be. [17.3.12]</p>
<p>‘I wouldn’t answer for his technical morals’, Russell concluded.</p>
<p>The remark jars. It shows that he had misunderstood the thrust of
Wittgenstein’s argument. For, if Wittgenstein was preaching honesty, he
was obviously not abominating ethics in the sense of arguing for a
licence for immorality. He was arguing for a morality based on
integrity, on being true to oneself, one’s impulses – a morality that
came from inside one’s self rather than one imposed from outside by
rules, principles and duties.</p>
<p>It was a question upon which, for Wittgenstein, a great deal would
have hung. In abandoning engineering for philosophy, had he not forsaken
what might have been seen as his duty in favour of pursuing something
that burned within him? And yet, as we have seen – and as Russell was
originally told – such a decision needed the justification that, in
doing so, he was not simply pursuing a whim, but following a course in
which he might conceivably make an important contribution.</p>
<p>Russell’s misunderstanding of the point is a hint of things to come,
a suggestion that his ‘theoretical passion’ and Wittgenstein’s were not,
after all, as similar as he had supposed. By the end of term their
relationship was such that Wittgenstein felt able to tell Russell what
he liked and disliked about his work. He spoke with great feeling about
the beauty of Principia, and said – what was probably the highest praise
he could give it – that it was like music. The popular work, however, he
disliked strongly – particularly ‘The Free Man’s Worship’ and the last
chapter of The Problems of Philosophy, on ‘The Value of Philosophy’. He
disliked the very idea of saying philosophy had value:</p>
<p>… he says people who like philosophy will pursue it, and others
won’t, and there is an end of it.34 His strongest impulse is philosophy.
[I7.3.I2]</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that Wittgenstein’s attitude was quite as
straightforward as Russell suggests. After all, for years before
becoming Russell’s pupil, he had suffered deeply from the conflict of
duty and impulse engendered by the fact that philosophy was his
strongest impulse. He indeed believed that one should be – as his father
had been, and as his brother Hans had been, and as all geniuses are – a
creature of impulse. But he also had an almost overbearing sense of
duty, and was prone to periodically crippling self-doubts. Russell’s
encouragement had been necessary precisely because it enabled him to
overcome these doubts, and to follow his strongest impulse happily. His
family had been struck by the immediate change that came over him after
he had been encouraged to work on philosophy by Russell. And he himself,
at the end of this term, told Russell that the happiest hours of his
life had been spent in his rooms. But this happiness was caused not
simply by his being allowed to follow his impulses, but also by the
conviction that – as he had an unusual talent for philosophy – he had
the right to do so.</p>
<p>It was important to Wittgenstein that Russell should understand him
on this point, and on the day he returned to Cambridge for the following
term, the theme was renewed. Russell found that he ‘wears well … quite
as good as I thought. I find him strangely exciting’, and was still
inclined to see no fundamental difference in their temperamental
outlook: ’He lives in the same intense excitement as I do, hardly able
to sit still or read a book.’35 Wittgenstein talked about Beethoven:</p>
<p>… how a friend described going to Beethoven’s door and hearing him
‘cursing, howling and singing’ over his new fugue; after a whole hour
Beethoven at last came to the door, looking as if he had been fighting
the devil, and having eaten nothing for 36 hours because his cook and
parlour-maid had been away from his rage. That’s the sort of man to
be.</p>
<p>But, again, this is not just anybody ‘cursing, howling and singing’.
Would Wittgenstein have felt this to be ‘the sort of man to be’ if all
this fierce absorption had produced only mediocre works? What is implied
is that, if one’s strongest impulse is to write music, and if, by
surrendering completely to that impulse one is able to write sublime
music, then one not only has the right to behave impulsively; one has a
duty to do so.</p>
<p>Similarly, Russell gave Wittgenstein the licence to behave in the
same way, because he recognized in him the quality of genius. He later
described Wittgenstein as:</p>
<p>… perhaps the most perfect example I have ever known of genius as
traditionally conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and
dominating.36</p>
<p>He had already come to see in Wittgenstein these qualities at the
beginning of this summer term. In his letter to Ottoline of 23 April, he
told her: ‘I don’t feel the subject neglected by my abandoning it, as
long as he takes it up’, adding, as if in illustration of the qualities
needed for the task: ’I thought he would have smashed all the furniture
in my room today, he got so excited.’37</p>
<p>Wittgenstein asked him how he and Whitehead were going to end
Principia. Russell replied that they would have no conclusion; the book
would just end ‘with whatever formula happened to come last’:</p>
<p>He seemed surprised at first, and then saw that was right.38 It seems
to me the beauty of the book would be spoilt if it contained a single
word that could possibly be spared.</p>
<p>This appeal to the beauty of the work would no doubt have been
sympathetically received by Wittgenstein, who was to take to new
heights, with the sparse prose of the Tractatus, the austere aesthetic
here advanced by Russell.</p>
<p>Already, by the beginning of the summer term, the relationship
between the two was beginning to change. Although he was still formally
Wittgenstein’s supervisor, Russell became increasingly anxious for his
approval. Over the Easter vacation he had begun work on a paper on
‘Matter’, to be delivered to the Philosophical Society at Cardiff
University. It was, he hoped, to be a work which demonstrated a renewed
vigour – ‘a model of cold passionate analysis, setting forth the most
painful conclusions with utter disregard of human feelings’.39 Cold and
passionate? Russell explained:</p>
<p>I haven’t had enough courage hitherto about matter. I haven’t been
sceptical enough. I want to write a paper which my enemies will call
‘the bankruptcy of realism’. There is nothing to compare to passion for
giving one cold insight. Most of my best work has been done in the
inspiration of remorse, but any passion will do if it is strong.
Philosophy is a reluctant mistress – one can only reach her heart with
the cold steel in the hand of passion.</p>
<p>‘Cold steel in the hand of passion’ – the phrase conjures up
perfectly Wittgenstein’s own combination of a rigorously logical mind
and an impulsive and obsessional nature. He was the very personification
of Russell’s philosophical ideal.</p>
<p>Russell was, however, to be disappointed with Wittgenstein’s reaction
to the project. He dismissed the whole subject as ‘a trivial
problem’:40</p>
<p>He admits that if there is no Matter then no one exists but himself,
but he says it doesn’t hurt, since physics and astronomy and all the
other sciences could still be interpreted so as to be true.</p>
<p>A few days later, when Wittgenstein actually read parts of the paper,
Russell was relieved to note a change of mind: Wittgenstein was
delighted by its radicalism. Russell began his paper by stating baldly
that all the arguments advanced hitherto by philosophers intending to
prove the existence of matter were, quite simply, fallacious. This,
declared Wittgenstein, was the best thing Russell had done. When he saw
the rest of the paper he changed his mind again and told Russell that he
did not like it after all, ‘but only’, Russell told Ottoline, clutching
at straws, ‘because of disagreement, not because of its being badly
done’.41 The paper, for which Russell originally had such high hopes,
remained unpublished.</p>
<p>The extraordinarily high opinion which Russell had of Wittgenstein
was bound to arouse the curiosity of his friends at Cambridge,
particularly among the Apostles, the self-consciously élite conversation
society (of which Russell himself was a member) which was at the time
dominated by John Maynard Keynes and Lytton Strachey. Wittgenstein
became what, in Apostolic jargon, was known as an ‘embryo’ – a person
under consideration for membership. Strachey (who lived in London) came
to tea with Wittgenstein at Russell’s rooms to inspect this potential
Apostle for himself. Wittgenstein had recently read Strachey’s Landmarks
in French Literature, but had not liked it. He told Russell that it made
an impression of effort, like the gasps of an asthmatic person. He
nevertheless took the trouble to shine at tea sufficiently to impress
Strachey. ‘Everybody has just begun to discover him’, Russell told
Ottoline afterwards; ’they all now realize he has genius.’42</p>
<p>As to whether Wittgenstein would want to join the Apostles, Russell
had doubts:</p>
<p>Somebody had been telling them about Wittgenstein and they wanted to
hear what I thought of him.43 They were thinking of electing him to the
Society. I told them I didn’t think he would like the Society. I am
quite sure he wouldn’t really. It would seem to him stuffy, as indeed it
has become, owing to their practice of being in love with each other,
which didn’t exist in my day – I think it is mainly due to Lytton.</p>
<p>Whether or not he was right in supposing that Wittgenstein would
object to the ‘stuffy’ atmosphere of the homosexual affairs which
dominated the Society at that time, he was, as it turned out, right to
suggest that Wittgenstein would not like the Apostles.</p>
<p>Strachey’s impressions of Wittgenstein, meanwhile, were somewhat
mixed. On 5 May he invited him for lunch, but on this second meeting he
was not impressed. ‘Herr Sinckel-Winckel lunches with me’, he wrote to
Keynes; ‘quiet little man’.44 Two weeks later the two met again in the
rooms of Strachey’s brother, James. This time the impression gained was
one of exhausting brilliance:</p>
<p>Herr Sinckel-Winckel hard at it on universals and particulars.45 The
latter oh! so bright – but quelle souffrance! Oh God! God! ‘If A loves
B’ – ‘There may be a common property’ – ‘Not analysable in that way at
all, but the complexes have certain qualities.’ How shall I manage to
slink off to bed?</p>
<p>There, for the moment, Wittgenstein’s connections with the Apostles
rested, until the following October when, after meeting Keynes, ‘Herr
Sinckel-Winckel’ became, briefly and disastrously, ‘Brother
Wittgenstein’.</p>
<p>From being ‘generally considered a bore’ by the young men at
Cambridge, Wittgenstein was now considered ‘interesting and pleasant,
though his sense of humour is heavy’.46 That, at least, was the
judgement of one of them, David Pinsent, who met him at one of Russell’s
‘squashes’ (social evenings) early in the summer term. Pinsent was then
in his second year as a mathematics undergraduate. The previous year he
had himself been an Apostolic ‘embryo’, but had not been elected. This
perhaps indicates how he was seen by the fashionable intellectual élite
at Cambridge – interesting but not fascinating, bright but not possessed
of genius.</p>
<p>To Wittgenstein, however, Pinsent’s musical sensitivity and his
equable temperament made him the ideal companion. He seems to have
recognized this very swiftly, within a month of knowing Pinsent
surprising him by inviting him on a holiday in Iceland, all expenses to
be met by Wittgenstein’s father. ‘I really don’t know what to think’,
Pinsent wrote in his diary:47</p>
<p>… it would certainly be fun, and I could not afford it myself, and
Vittgenstein [sic] seems very anxious for me to come. I deferred my
decision and wrote home for advice: Iceland seems rather attractive: I
gather that all inland travelling has to be done on horse back, which
would be supreme fun! The whole idea attracts and surprises me: I have
known Vittgenstein only for three weeks or so – but we seem to get on
well together: he is very musical with the same tastes as I. He is an
Austrian – but speaks English fluently. I should say about my age.</p>
<p>Until then their acquaintance had been confined to Pinsent’s acting
as a subject in some experiments that Wittgenstein was conducting in the
psychological laboratory. It seems to have been his intention to
investigate scientifically the role of rhythm in musical appreciation.
For this he presumably needed a subject with some understanding of
music. In his diary Pinsent does not describe what the experiments
involved, recording only that taking part in them was ‘not bad fun’.
Wittgenstein was helped in this work by the psychologist C. S. Myers,
who took the experiments seriously enough to introduce a demonstration
of them to the British Society of Psychology. The chief result obtained
from them was that, in some circumstances, subjects heard an accent on
certain notes that was not in fact there.</p>
<p>Apart from taking part in these experiments two or three times a
week, Pinsent’s only contact with Wittgenstein before being invited to
spend a holiday with him had been at Russell’s Thursday evening
‘squashes’. After one of these, on 30 May, he reports that he found
Wittgenstein ‘very amusing’:</p>
<p>… he is reading philosophy up here, but has only just started
systematic reading: and he expresses the most naive surprise that all
the philosophers he once worshipped in ignorance are after all stupid
and dishonest and make disgusting mistakes!48</p>
<p>But it was not until after Wittgenstein’s unexpected invitation that
a close friendship began to develop. The following day the two attended
a concert together, after which they went to Wittgenstein’s rooms, where
they stayed talking until 11.30. Wittgenstein was ‘very communicative
and told me lots about himself’.49 It was then that he told Pinsent that
Russell’s encouragement to pursue philosophy had been his salvation,
after nine years of suicidal loneliness and suffering. Pinsent
added:</p>
<p>Russell, I know, has a high opinion of him: and has been corrected by
him and convinced that he (Russell) was wrong in one or two points of
Philosophy: and Russell is not the only philosophical don up here that
Vittgenstein has convinced of error. Vittgenstein has few hobbies, which
rather accounts for his loneliness. One can’t thrive entirely on big and
important pursuits like Triposes. But he is quite interesting and
pleasant: I fancy he has quite got over his morbidness now.</p>
<p>After this Wittgenstein and Pinsent saw much of each other, going to
concerts at the Cambridge University Musical Club, dining together at
the Union and meeting for tea in each other’s rooms. Wittgenstein even
attended a service at the college chapel especially to hear Pinsent read
the lesson.</p>
<p>Despite his earlier having been described by Russell as ‘terrible’
with Christians, this may not have been quite so out of character as it
appears. At about the same time, in fact, he surprised Russell by
suddenly saying how much he admired the text: ‘What shall it profit a
man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul’:</p>
<p>[He] then went on to say how few there are who don’t lose their
soul.50 I said it depended on having a large purpose that one is true
to. He said he thought it depended more on suffering and the power to
endure it. I was surprised – I hadn’t expected that kind of thing from
him.</p>
<p>The stoicism expressed here seems related to something Wittgenstein
later told Norman Malcolm. During one of his holidays at home in Vienna,
his previously contemptuous attitude to religion had been changed by
seeing a play, Die Kreuzelscheiber by the Austrian dramatist and
novelist Ludwig Anzengruber.fn1 It was mediocre drama, but in it one of
the characters expressed the thought that no matter what happened in the
world, nothing bad could happen to him. He was independent of fate and
circumstances. This stoic thought struck Wittgenstein powerfully, and,
so he told Malcolm, he saw, for the first time, the possibility of
religion.</p>
<p>For the rest of his life he continued to regard the feeling of being
‘absolutely safe’ as paradigmatic of religious experience. A few months
after the conversation with Russell quoted above, we find him reading
William James’s Varieties of Religious Experience, and telling
Russell:</p>
<p>This book does me a lot of good.51 I don’t mean to say that I will be
a saint soon, but I am not sure that it does not improve me a little in
a way in which I would like to improve very much: namely I think that it
helps me to get rid of the Sorge [worry, anxiety] (in the sense in which
Goethe used the word in the 2nd part of Faust).</p>
<p>Two days after the discussion on losing and retaining one’s soul,
Russell and Wittgenstein had another conversation which revealed
something of the deep differences between their respective ethical
views. It arose out of a discussion of Dickens’s David Copperfield.
Wittgenstein maintained that it was wrong for Copperfield to have
quarrelled with Steerforth for running away with Little Emily. Russell
replied that, in the same circumstances, he would have done the same.
Wittgenstein was ‘much pained, and refused to believe it; thought one
could and should always be loyal to friends and go on loving
them’.52</p>
<p>Russell then asked him how he would feel if he were married to a
woman and she ran away with another man:</p>
<p>[Wittgenstein] said (and I believe him) that he would feel no rage or
hate, only utter misery.53 His nature is good through and through; that
is why he doesn’t see the need of morals. I was utterly wrong at first;
he might do all kinds of things in passion, but he would not practise
any cold-blooded immorality. His outlook is very free; principles and
such things seem to him nonsense, because his impulses are strong and
never shameful.</p>
<p>‘I think he is passionately devoted to me’, Russell added. ‘Any
difference of feeling causes him great pain. My feeling towards him is
passionate, but of course my absorption in you makes it less important
to me than his feeling is to him.’</p>
<p>Russell seemed slow to appreciate that their differences of feeling
were important to Wittgenstein because they touched upon issues of
fundamental importance to him. He was slow, too, to understand that
Wittgenstein’s emphasis on personal integrity (and, in the above case,
loyalty) was not something opposed to morality, but something which
constituted a different morality. It is typical of their fundamentally
opposed attitudes, for example, that Russell, even in this, perhaps his
most introspective period, should think that keeping one’s soul depended
upon a ‘large purpose that one was true to’ – that he was inclined to
look outside himself for something to sustain him. It was typical, too,
for Wittgenstein to insist that the possibility of remaining uncorrupted
rested entirely on one’s self – on the qualities one found within. If
one’s soul was pure (and disloyalty to a friend was one thing that would
make it impure), then no matter what happened to one ‘externally’ – even
if one’s wife ran away with another man – nothing could happen to one’s
self. Thus, it is not external matters that should be of the greatest
concern, but one’s self. The Sorge that prevents one facing the world
with equanimity is thus a matter of more immediate concern than any
misfortune that may befall one through the actions of others.</p>
<p>When attitudes of the most fundamental kind clash, there can be no
question of agreement or disagreement, for everything one says or does
is interpreted from within those attitudes. It is therefore not
surprising that there should be frustration and incomprehension on both
sides. What is surprising is Russell’s rather naïve assumption that he
was faced, not with a different set of ideals to his own, but simply
with a rather peculiar person, a person whose ‘impulses are strong and
never shameful’. It is as though he could make sense of Wittgenstein’s
views only by appealing to some fact about Wittgenstein that would make
his holding such views intelligible. Finding Wittgenstein’s outlook
alien and incomprehensible, he could seek only to explain it, not to
make sense of it. He was incapable. as it were, of getting inside
it.</p>
<p>Again and again, in Russell’s letters to Ottoline, one has the
feeling that the spirit of Wittgenstein’s ‘theoretical passion’ eluded
him. The centrality of the notion of personal integrity in
Wittgenstein’s outlook was interpreted by him at various times as the
rejection of conventional morality, the sign of a pure, uncorrupted
nature – and even, on at least one occasion, as a joke. At one of
Russell’s ‘quashes’, Wittgenstein defended the view that a study of
mathematics would improve a person’s taste: ‘since good taste is genuine
taste and therefore is fostered by whatever makes people think
truthfully’.54 From Russell’s account to Ottoline, one gathers he found
this argument impossible to take seriously. He describes Wittgenstein’s
view as a ‘paradox’, and says ‘we were all against him’. And yet there
is every reason to suppose that Wittgenstein was speaking in complete
earnest: honesty and good taste were, for him, closely intertwined
notions.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was not one to debate his most fundamental convictions.
Dialogue with him was possible only if one shared those convictions.
(Thus, dialogue with Russell on ethical questions was soon to become
impossible.) To one who did not share his fundamental outlook, his
utterances – whether on logic or on ethics – would, as likely as not,
remain unintelligible. It was a tendency that began to worry Russell. ‘I
am seriously afraid’, he told Ottoline, ’that no one will see the point
of what he writes, because he won’t recommend it by arguments addressed
to a different point of view.’55 When Russell told him he ought not
simply to state what he thought, but should also provide arguments for
it, he replied that arguments would spoil its beauty. He would feel as
if he were dirtying a flower with muddy hands:</p>
<p>I told him I hadn’t the heart to say anything against that, and that
he had better acquire a slave to state the arguments.56</p>
<p>Russell had good reason to worry about whether Wittgenstein would be
understood, for he increasingly came to feel that the future of his own
work in logic should be placed in Wittgenstein’s hands. He even felt
that when his five-year lectureship at Trinity expired he should give it
up and let Wittgenstein take his place. ‘It is really amazing how the
world of learning has grown unreal to me’, he wrote.57 ‘Mathematics has
quite faded out of my thoughts, except when proofs bring it back with a
jerk. Philosophy doesn’t often come into my mind, and I have no impulse
to work at it.’ Despite what he had written in the last chapter of
Problems of Philosophy, he had lost faith in the value of
philosophy:</p>
<p>I did seriously mean to go back to it, but I found I really couldn’t
think it was very valuable.58 This is partly due to Wittgenstein, who
has made me more of a sceptic; partly it is the result of a process
which has been going on ever since I found you.</p>
<p>The ‘process’ he mentions was his growing interest, inspired by
Ottoline, in non-philosophical work. First, there was Prisons, his book
on religion; then an autobiography (which he abandoned and, apparently,
destroyed); and finally an autobiographical novella called The
Perplexities of John Forstice, in which, no doubt using some of the
material he had written for his autobiography, and quoting extensively
from his own letters to Ottoline, he attempted to describe imaginatively
his own intellectual pilgrimage from isolation, through moral and
political confusion, to clarity and grace. Russell was not at his best
with this sort of writing, and none of the works mentioned saw the light
of day during his lifetime. ‘I do wish I were more creative’, he
lamented to Ottoline.59 ‘A man like Mozart makes one feel such a worm.’
In later life he agreed to the posthumous publication of Forstice, but
with serious reservations:</p>
<p>… the second part represented my opinions during only a very short
period.60 My view in the second part were very sentimental, much too
mild, and much too favourable to religion. In all this I was unduly
influenced by Lady Ottoline Morrell.</p>
<p>For better or for worse, it was during this ‘very short period’ that
Wittgenstein was making his phenomenal progress in the analysis of
logic. And perhaps his acceptance as a philosophical genius owes
something to the influence exerted by Ottoline over Russell. If Russell
had not been going through such a sentimental phase, he may not have
taken to Wittgenstein in the way that he did: ‘Wittgenstein brought me
the most lovely roses today.61 He is a treasure’ (23.4.12); ‘I love him
as if he were my son’ (22.8.12).62 And, perhaps, if he had not lost
faith and interest in his own contribution to mathematical logic, he
might not have been quite so prepared to hand the subject over to
Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>As it was, by the end of his first year at Cambridge, Wittgenstein
was being primed as Russell’s successor. At the end of the summer term,
when Hermine visited Cambridge and was taken to meet Russell, she was
amazed to hear him say: ’We expect the next big step in philosophy to be
taken by your brother.’63</p>
<p>At the beginning of the summer vacation Wittgenstein was offered G.
E. Moore’s old college rooms. He had, until then, been living in
lodgings in Rose Crescent, and he accepted Moore’s offer gratefully. The
rooms were perfectly situated for him, at the top of K staircase in
Whewell’s Court, with a splendid view of Trinity College. He liked being
at the top of the tower, and kept the same set of rooms for the rest of
his time at Cambridge, even when he returned in later life, when as a
Fellow and, later, as a Professor he would have been entitled to larger
and grander rooms.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein chose the furniture for his rooms with great care. He
was helped in this by Pinsent:</p>
<p>I went out and helped him interview a lot of furniture at various
shops: he is moving into college next term.64 It was rather amusing: he
is terribly fastidious and we led the shopman a frightful dance,
Vittgenstein ejaculating ‘No – Beastly!’ to 90% of what he shewed
us!</p>
<p>Russell, too, was drawn into Wittgenstein’s deliberations on the
matter, and found it rather exasperating. ‘He is very fussy’, he told
Ottoline, ‘and bought nothing at all yesterday.65 He gave me a lecture
on how furniture should be made – he dislikes all ornamentation that is
not part of the construction, and can never find anything simple
enough.’ In the end Wittgenstein had his furniture specially made for
him. When it arrived it was judged by Pinsent to be ‘rather quaint but
not bad’.66</p>
<p>Neither Pinsent nor Russell was well placed to understand
Wittgenstein’s fastidiousness in the matter. To appreciate his concern
for design and craftsmanship, one would have to have had some experience
of construction. Thus, a few years later, we find Eccles, his engineer
friend from Manchester, sending him some furniture designs of his own
for Wittgenstein’s comments, and receiving in reply a carefully
considered, and gratefully accepted, verdict.</p>
<p>And to understand the strength of Wittgenstein’s feeling against
superfluous ornamentation – to appreciate the ethical importance it had
for him – one would have to have been Viennese; one would have to have
felt, like Karl Kraus and Adolf Loos, that the once noble culture of
Vienna, which from Haydn to Schubert had surpassed anything else in the
world, had, since the latter half of the nineteenth century, atrophied
into, in Paul Engelmann’s words, an ‘arrogated base culture – a culture
turned into its opposite, misused as ornament and mask’.67</p>
<p>On 15 July Wittgenstein returned to Vienna, having arranged with
Pinsent (whose parents had given the proposed holiday in Iceland their
blessing) to meet in London during the first week of September. Home
life in Vienna was not easy. His father had cancer and had been operated
on several times; Gretl was having a baby and experiencing a difficult
birth; and he himself was operated on for a hernia, discovered during an
examination for military service. This latter he kept secret from his
mother, who was in a distraught state looking after the invalid
father.</p>
<p>From Vienna he wrote to Russell telling him: ‘I am quite well again
and philosophizing for all I am worth.’68 His thought progressed from
thinking about the meaning of logical constants (the Russellian signs
‘v’, ‘~’, ‘⊃’ etc.) to deciding that: ‘our problems can be traced down
to the atomic prop[osition]s’. But in his letters to Russell he gave
only hints as to what theory of logical symbolism this progression would
result in.</p>
<p>‘I am glad you read the lives of Mozart and Beethoven’, he told
Russell.69 ‘These are the actual sons of God.’ He told Russell of his
delight on reading Tolstoy’s Hadji Murat: ‘Have you ever read it? If
not, you ought to, for it is wonderful.’</p>
<p>When he arrived in London on 4 September he stayed as a guest of
Russell’s in his new flat in Bury Street. Russell found him a refreshing
change from Bloomsbury – ‘a great contrast to the Stephens and Stracheys
and such would-be geniuses’:70</p>
<p>We very soon plunged into logic and have had great arguments. He has
a very great power of seeing what are really important problems.</p>
<p>… He gives me such a delightful lazy feeling that I can leave a whole
department of difficult thought to him, which used to depend on me
alone. It makes it easier for me to give up technical work. Only his
health seems to me very precarious – he gives one the feeling of a
person whose life is very insecure. And I think he is growing deaf.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reference to Wittgenstein’s hearing problem is ironic; in
any case, it was not true that he couldn’t hear, simply that he wouldn’t
listen – especially when Russell offered some ‘sage advice’ not to put
off writing until he had solved all the problems of philosophy. That
day, Russell told him, would never come:</p>
<p>This produced a wild outburst – he has the artist’s feeling that he
will produce the perfect thing or nothing – I explained how he wouldn’t
get a degree or be able to teach unless he learnt to write imperfect
things – this all made him more and more furious – at last he begged me
not to give him up even if he disappointed me.71</p>
<p>Pinsent arrived in London the next day, to be met by Wittgenstein,
who insisted on taking him by taxi to the Grand Hotel, Trafalgar Square.
Pinsent tried in vain to suggest some less luxurious hotel, but
Wittgenstein would not hear of it. There was evidently, as Pinsent noted
in his diary, to be no sparing of expense on this trip. Once at the
hotel Pinsent was told the financial arrangements:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein, or rather his father, insists on paying for both of us:
I had expected him to be pretty liberal – but he surpassed all my
expectations: Wittgenstein handed me over £145 in notes, and kept the
same amount in notes himself. He also has a letter of Credit for about
£200!72</p>
<p>From London they went by train to Cambridge (‘I need hardly say we
travelled first class!’), where Wittgenstein had to attend to some
business connected with his new college rooms, and then on to Edinburgh,
where they stayed overnight before the boat journey. At Edinburgh,
Wittgenstein took Pinsent on a shopping trip; he had not, he insisted,
brought enough clothes:</p>
<p>… he is being very fussy about taking enough clothing: he himself has
three bags of luggage, and is much perturbed by my single box.73 He made
me buy a second rug in Cambridge and several other odds and ends in
Edinboroughfn2 this morning: I have resisted a good deal – especially as
it is not my money I am thus spending. I got my own back on him,
however, by inducing him to buy oilskins, which he has not got.</p>
<p>On 7 September they set off from Leith on the Sterling, which to
Wittgenstein’s disgust looked much like an ordinary cross-Channel
steamer – he had expected something grander. He calmed down when they
discovered a piano on board and Pinsent, who had brought a collection of
Schubert’s songs, sat down to play, heartily encouraged by the other
passengers. It was a five-day boat journey across fairly rough sea, and
both Pinsent and Wittgenstein suffered from it, although Pinsent notes
with curiosity that Wittgenstein, though he spent a great deal of time
in his cabin lying down, was never actually sick.</p>
<p>They reached Reykjavik on 12 September, and as soon as they had
booked into the hotel, they hired a guide to take them on a journey
inland, starting the following day. At the hotel they had their first
argument – about public schools. The argument got quite heated, until,
so Pinsent records, they found that they had misunderstood each other:
‘He has an enormous horror of what he calls a “Philistine” attitude
towards cruelty and suffering – any callous attitude – and accuses
Kipling of such: and he got the idea that I sympathised with it’.74</p>
<p>A week later, the subject of ‘Philistine’ attitudes was renewed:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein has been talking a lot, at different times, about
‘Philistines’ – a name he gives to all people he dislikes! (vide supra –
Thursday Sept: 12th) I think some of the views I have expressed have
struck him as a bit philistine (views – that is – on practical things
(not on philosophy) – for instance on the advantage of this age over
past ages and so forth), and he is rather puzzled because he does not
consider me really a Philistine – and I don’t think he dislikes me! He
satisfies himself by saying that I shall think differently as soon as I
am a bit older!75</p>
<p>It is tempting to see in these arguments a contrast between the
pessimism of Viennese Angst and the optimism of British stolidity (at
least, as it existed before the First World War had weakened even the
British faith in ‘the advantage of this age over past ages’). But if so,
then it was exactly the qualities in Pinsent that made it impossible for
him to share Wittgenstein’s cultural pessimism that also made him the
ideal companion.</p>
<p>Even Pinsent’s cheerful equanimity, however, could sometimes be
strained by Wittgenstein’s nervousness – his ‘fussiness’, as Pinsent
called it. On their second day in Reykjavik they went to the office of
the steamship company to secure their berths home. There was some
trouble in making themselves understood, but the matter was eventually
resolved, at least to Pinsent’s satisfaction:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein however got terribly fussy and talked about our not
getting home at all, and I got quite irritated with him: eventually he
went off alone and got a man from the bank to act as interpreter and go
through the whole business again at the steamship office.76</p>
<p>Such temporary lapses in Pinsent’s good humour, though infrequent,
disturbed Wittgenstein greatly. On 21 September we read:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was a bit sulky all the evening: he is very sensitive if
I get, momentarily, a bit irritated over some trifle – as I did tonight
– I forget what about: the result being that he was depressed and silent
for the rest of the evening. He is always imploring me not to be
irritable: and I do my best, and really, I think, I have not been so
often on this trip!77</p>
<p>Ten days of the holiday were taken up with a journey inland on
ponies. Again, no expense was spared. The cortège consisted of
Wittgenstein, Pinsent and their guide, each on a pony, while in front
they drove two pack ponies and three spare ponies. During the day they
rode and explored the countryside, and in the evenings Wittgenstein
taught Pinsent mathematical logic, which Pinsent found ‘excessively
interesting’ – ‘Wittgenstein makes a very good teacher’.</p>
<p>Occasionally they explored the countryside on foot, and even once
attempted some rock-climbing, at which neither was very proficient. It
made Wittgenstein ‘terribly nervous’:</p>
<p>His fussyness comes out here again – he is always begging me not to
risk my life! It is funny that he should be like that – for otherwise he
is quite a good travelling companion.78</p>
<p>On their walks the talk would mostly be of logic, Wittgenstein
continuing to educate Pinsent on the subject: ’I am learning a lot from
him. He is really remarkably clever.’79</p>
<p>I have never yet been able to find the smallest fault in his
reasoning: and yet he has made me reconstruct entirely my ideas on
several subjects.</p>
<p>When, after their excursion through the Icelandic countryside, they
were back at the Reykjavik hotel, Pinsent took the opportunity of having
some lighter conversation with ‘a very splendid bounder’ who had just
arrived. It prompted a long discussion about ‘such people’: ‘he simply
won’t speak to them, but really, I think, they are rather amusing’.80
The following day: ‘Wittgenstein made an awful fuss.’ He took such a
violent dislike to Pinsent’s ‘splendid bounder’ that he refused to
contemplate eating at the same table. To ensure that this didn’t happen,
he gave orders that their meal was to be served an hour earlier than
table d’hôte in all cases. At lunch they forgot, and rather than take
the chance, Wittgenstein took Pinsent out to see if they could find
anything in Reykjavik. They couldn’t. So Wittgenstein ate a few biscuits
in his room, and Pinsent went to table d’hôte. In the evening Pinsent
found Wittgenstein ‘still fairly sulky about the lunch business’, but
they got their supper an hour early as arranged, and had champagne with
it, ‘which cheered him up a bit, finally leaving him quite
normal’.81</p>
<p>Pinsent stayed receptive and cheerful throughout. On the boat home
Wittgenstein took him into the engine room and explained to him how the
engines worked. He also described the research he was doing in logic. ‘I
really believe he has discovered something good’, Pinsent comments –
without, unfortunately, mentioning what it was.82</p>
<p>On the return journey, Pinsent persuaded Wittgenstein to spend a
night with his family in Birmingham – he was keen to show him off to his
parents. The inducement was a concert at the town hall, the programme
for which was Brahms’s Requiem, Strauss’s Salome, Beethoven’s Seventh
Symphony and a Bach motet, ‘Be not afraid’. Wittgenstein enjoyed the
Brahms, refused to go in for the Strauss and left the hall as soon as
the Beethoven had finished. At supper, Pinsent’s father was suitably
impressed when Pinsent got Wittgenstein to explain to him some of the
logic that he had taught him during the holiday. ‘I think father was
interested’, he writes, and – less hesitantly – ’certainly he agreed
with me afterwards that Wittgenstein is really very clever and
acute.’83</p>
<p>For Pinsent it had been: ’the most glorious holiday I have ever
spent!’84</p>
<p>The novelty of the country – of being free of all considerations
about economising – the excitement and everything – all combine to make
it the most wonderful experience I have ever had. It leaves almost a
mystic-romantic impression on me: for the greatest romance consists in
novel sensations – novel surroundings – and so forth, whatever they be
provided they are novel.</p>
<p>Not so for Wittgenstein. What remained in his memory were their
differences and disagreements – perhaps the very occasions mentioned in
Pinsent’s diary – Pinsent’s occasional irritability, hints of his
‘Philistinism’, and the incident with the ‘bounder’. He later told
Pinsent that he had enjoyed it, ‘as much as it is possible for two
people to do who are nothing to each other’.</p>
<p>fn1 He told Malcolm he was about twenty-one years old when this event
took place, which would date it 1910 or early 1911. Because of the
change in Wittgenstein’s attitude to religion noted by Russell in the
summer of 1912, however, it is tempting to date the episode to the
Easter vacation of the year.</p>
<p>fn2 This, as are other eccentric spellings in Pinsent’s letters, is
authentic.</p>
