<h4 id="behind-the-lines">6 BEHIND THE LINES</h4>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN ARRIVED BACK at the Hochreit towards the end of June
1914. His intention was to spend the early part of the summer there,
before taking a two-week holiday with Pinsent starting at the end of
August, and, finally, visiting old friends in England (e.g. Eccles)
before returning to Norway in the autumn, there to live in his new house
and to complete his book.</p>
<p>Throughout July, as the crisis following the assassination of
Archduke Franz Ferdinand worsened and the European powers prepared for
war, Wittgenstein and Pinsent exchanged letters discussing their
proposed holiday. Should they go to Spain as planned, or to somewhere
more remote? Eventually they agreed to meet at the Grand Hotel in
Trafalgar Square on 24 August, and to decide then where they should go.
In his reply to a letter from Eccles dated 28 June (the very day of the
assassination), in which Eccles had told Wittgenstein of his new house
and of the baby – ‘the little stranger’ – that his wife was expecting
some time in August, we find Wittgenstein promising, with complete
confidence, to visit Eccles in Manchester around 10 September, after he
and Pinsent had returned from wherever they had decided to go. ‘I hope
the little stranger keeps well’, Wittgenstein replied, ’and I hope he’ll
turn out to be a boy.’1</p>
<p>Eccles had written asking Wittgenstein’s advice on a proposed suite
of bedroom furniture – wardrobe, medicine chest and dressing table –
which Eccles had designed and was proposing to have manufactured. Such
faith did he have in Wittgenstein’s judgement on these matters that his
new drawing room was a copy of Wittgenstein’s room in Cambridge: blue
carpet, black paint, yellow walls. ‘The effect,’ he told Wittgenstein,
’is greatly admired by everyone.’2</p>
<p>Eccles’s own criteria of good design are outlined in the letter: the
greatest utility, the easiest method of construction, and absolute
simplicity were, he said, the only things he had considered. They were
criteria which Wittgenstein could readily approve. ‘Splendid’ was his
verdict on Eccles’s designs, suggesting only some alterations to the
wardrobe, based on purely functional considerations. ‘I can’t see any
drawing of a bed’, he added:</p>
<p>… or do you wish to take the one which the furniture manufacturers
submitted? If so do insist that they cut off all those measly fancy
ends. And why should the bed stand on rollers? You’re not going to
travel about with it in your house!? By all means have the other things
made after your design.</p>
<p>Though Wittgenstein and Eccles were at one in their preference for
functional design, stripped of any sort of ornamentation, we can, I
think, assume that for Wittgenstein the issue had a cultural, even an
ethical, importance that it did not for Eccles. To the intellectuals of
Jung Wien, the abhorrence of unnecessary ornamentation was at the centre
of a more general revolt against what they saw as the empty posturing
that characterized the decaying culture of the Habsburg Empire. Karl
Kraus’s campaign against the feuilleton, and Adolf Loos’s notoriously
unadorned building on the Mischlerplatz, were but two aspects of the
same struggle. That Wittgenstein, to some extent at least, identified
with this struggle is evident from his admiration for the work of its
two chief protagonists.</p>
<p>While in Norway Wittgenstein had had Kraus’s Die Fackel sent to him,
and came across an article written by Kraus about Ludwig von Ficker, a
writer who was an admirer of Kraus, and who was himself the editor of a
Krausian journal published in Innsbruck, called Der Brenner (‘The
Burner’). On 14 July Wittgenstein wrote to Ficker offering to transfer
to him the sum of 100,000 crowns, with the request that he distribute
the money ‘among Austrian artists who are without means’. ‘I am turning
to you in this matter’, he explained, ’since I assume that you are
acquainted with many of our best talents and know which of them are most
in need of support.’3</p>
<p>Ficker was, quite naturally, dumbfounded by the letter. He had
neither met Wittgenstein nor heard of him, and this offer to place at
his disposal such a large sum of money (100,000 crowns was the
equivalent of £4000 in 1914, and therefore of perhaps £40,000–£50,000 of
today’s currency) needed, he thought, to be checked. He replied asking
whether he could really take it that the offer was meant in all
seriousness, that it was not a joke. ‘In order to convince you that I am
sincere in my offer’, Wittgenstein answered, ‘I can probably do nothing
better than actually transfer the sum of money to you; and this will
happen the next time I come to Vienna.’4 He explained that upon the
death of his father he had come into a large fortune, and: ‘It is a
custom in such cases to donate a sum to charitable causes.’ He had
chosen Ficker ‘because of what Kraus wrote about you and your journal in
the Fackel, and because of what you wrote about Kraus’.fn1</p>
<p>Having received this letter, and having arranged to meet Wittgenstein
at Neuwaldeggergasse on 26–7 July, Ficker endeavoured to find out
something about him from his Viennese friends. From the painter Max von
Esterle he learnt that Wittgenstein’s father had been one of the richest
Kohlen-Juden in the empire, and a generous patron of the visual arts.6
Reassured as to the sincerity of Wittgenstein’s offer, Ficker travelled
to Vienna to meet him in person and to discuss the allocation of the
money. He stayed two days in the Wittgenstein house in
Neuwaldeggergasse. Wittgenstein (he said in a memoir published in 1954)
reminded him of such figures as Aloysha in The Brothers Karamazov and
Myshkin in The Idiot: ‘a picture of stirring loneliness at the first
glance’.7</p>
<p>Somewhat to Ficker’s surprise, very little of their weekend together
was taken up with a discussion of the matter in hand. Indeed, the
subject of the allocation was broached only on the second day of his
visit. Wittgenstein, initially, seemed more anxious to tell Ficker a
little about himself. He described his work on logic, and its relation
to the work of Frege and Russell. He told also of his hut in Norway, and
of how he now lived among Norwegian peasants, and of his intention to
return to Norway to continue his work. It is difficult to resist the
conclusion that Wittgenstein’s offer to Ficker was motivated not only by
philanthropy, but also by a desire to establish some contact with the
intellectual life of Austria. After all, he had severed communication
with his Cambridge friends, Russell and Moore, despairing of their ever
understanding his ideals and sensitivities. Perhaps among Austrians he
might be better understood.</p>
<p>While in Vienna Ficker introduced Wittgenstein to Adolf Loos.
Ficker’s introduction was, for Wittgenstein, the highlight of his visit.
‘It makes me very happy to have been able to meet him’, he wrote to
Ficker on 1 August.8 Indeed, so close were their concerns and their
attitudes at this time, that Loos himself is reported to have exclaimed
on meeting Wittgenstein: ’You are me!’9</p>
<p>When they eventually got around to discussing the disbursement of the
money, Wittgenstein’s one condition was that 10,000 crowns should go to
the Brenner itself; the rest was to be left to Ficker himself to
distribute.</p>
<p>Ficker had already decided who his three main beneficiaries should
be: Rainer Maria Rilke, Georg Trakl and Carl Dallago. Each would receive
20,000 crowns. Rilke is one of the few modern poets that Wittgenstein is
known to have admired, and he welcomed Ficker’s suggestion. Trakl’s
name, too, he accepted readily. About Dallago he made no comment.
Dallago was a bohemian figure, well known at the time as a writer and
philosopher. A regular contributor to the Brenner, he espoused an
anti-materialistic, anti-scientific outlook that embraced Eastern
mysticism and a celebration of the emotional, ‘feminine’, side of human
nature.</p>
<p>Of the remaining 30,000 crowns, 5000 each went to the writer Karl
Hauer (a friend of Trakl’s and an erstwhile contributor to Die Fackel)
and the painter Oskar Kokoschka; 4000 to Else Lasker-Schüler (a poet and
a regular contributor to Der Brenner); 2000 each to Adolf Loos and the
writers Theodor Haecker, Theodor Däubler, Ludwig Erik Tesar, Richard
Weiss and Franz Kranewitter; and 1000 each to Hermann Wagner, Josef
Oberkofler, Karl Heinrich and Hugo Neugebauer.</p>
<p>Another contributor to Der Brenner, the expressionist writer Albert
Ehrenstein, also seems to have benefited from Ficker’s allocation of the
money. So, at least, Wittgenstein thought. ‘Once I helped him
financially without really meaning to’, he later told Paul Engelmann.10
In gratitude, Ehrenstein had sent him two of his books, Tubutsch and Man
Screams, which Wittgenstein declared were: ‘just muck if I’m not
mistaken’.</p>
<p>It is very doubtful whether he knew the work of most of the artists
whom he helped, and still more doubtful that he would have admired it if
he had. From his responses to the letters of gratitude that were passed
on to him by Ficker, there is no sign at all of any admiration for most
of these artists, and, indeed, his reactions reveal a certain disdain
for the whole business. The first such letter he received was from
Dallago. Wittgenstein sent it straight back to Ficker: ‘I do not know
whether you have any use for it, but I am returning it anyway.’11 And
when he was later sent a collection of such letters, he returned them
all, saying that he did not need them as documents, and: ‘as thanks they
were – to be frank – for the most part highly distasteful to me.12 A
certain degrading, almost swindling tone – etc.’</p>
<p>Something of this distance from the ‘needy’ artists he had patronized
was felt by at least one of the beneficiaries, Theodor Haecker, whose
German translations of Kierkegaard were published in Der Brenner, and
did much to stimulate the interest of Austrian intellectuals in the
Danish philosopher before the First World War. Haecker was at first
inclined to refuse the money. The condition specified in Wittgenstein’s
instructions to Ficker was that the money should go to artists in need,
and this was, he argued, a condition he could not meet. It would be
different if a rich person had been so taken by his translations of
Kierkegaard that he wished to pay for them: ‘but a gift which the
sponsor has expressly tied to the condition of the neediness of the
recipient, I cannot and will not accept’.13 In his reply Ficker urged
that it was appropriate, and in accordance with the wishes of the
benefactor, that Haecker should be granted a portion of the donation.
Haecker was reassured, and accepted the money, but there is no sign that
Wittgenstein took any more pride in having helped Haecker than in having
helped Ehrenstein.</p>
<p>Of only three of the beneficiaries can one say with any certainty
that Wittgenstein both knew of their work and admired it: Loos, Rilke
and Trakl. And even here we must add the provisos that, though he
admired the tone of Trakl’s work, he professed himself incapable of
understanding it; that he came to dislike Rilke’s later poetry; and
that, after the war, he denounced Loos as a charlatan.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Rilke’s letter of thanks he described as ‘kind’ and
‘noble’:</p>
<p>[It] both moved and deeply gladdened me.14 The affection of any noble
human being is a support in the unsteady balance of my life. I am
totally unworthy of the splendid present which I carry over my heart as
a sign and remembrance of this affection. If you could only convey my
deepest thanks and my faithful devotion to Rilke.</p>
<p>Of Trakl’s poems, he probably knew nothing until he was sent a
collection of them by Ficker. He replied: ‘I do not understand them, but
their tone makes me happy. It is the tone of true genius.’</p>
<p>The weekend during which Wittgenstein and Ficker discussed the
allocation of money to the artists of the Austro-Hungarian Empire was
the weekend that sealed the fate of that empire. The Austro-Hungarian
ultimatum to Serbia had been presented on 23 July, and the deadline for
their acceptance of its terms was Saturday 25 July, at 6 p.m. No
acceptance was received, and accordingly, on 28 July, Austria declared
war on Serbia.</p>
<p>Even at this late stage – and within a week, the whole of Europe
would be at war – it was not generally realized that this would have any
effect on relations between Austria-Hungary and Britain. Public opinion
in Britain – in so far as it concerned itself with such things – was
sympathetic to the Habsburgs and antagonistic towards the Serbians. The
British newspapers were almost as passionate in their denunciation of
the murder of the Archduke as were their Austrian counterparts.</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, it is not surprising to read, in a letter to
Wittgenstein dated 29 July, Pinsent’s confident confirmation of their
arrangement to meet at the Grand Hotel on 24 August. The only doubt
expressed by him concerns their destination. Should it be Andorra or the
Faeroe Islands? Or perhaps somewhere else? ‘I suppose Madeira wouldn’t
suit you’, he suggested optimistically.15 ‘Of course’, he wrote, without
any discernible enthusiasm, ‘there are out of the way places in the
British Isles.’ But: ‘I don’t think we had better go to Ireland, as
there will almost certainly be riots andandandand civil war of a sort
there soon!’ Scotland might do (this had evidently been Wittgenstein’s
suggestion) – say, Orkney or Shetland, or the Hebrides. And, indeed,
this might, in one respect, be preferable to a holiday on the Continent.
For:</p>
<p>Perhaps in view of this European War business we had better not go to
Andorra – it might be difficult to get back.</p>
<p>By the absurd logic of what A. J. P. Taylor had called ‘war by
time-table’, ‘this European war business’ had led, within a few days of
Wittgenstein’s receiving this letter, to his country and Pinsent’s being
on different sides in the First World War.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s first reaction seems to have been to try and get out
of Austria, perhaps to England or to Norway. When that failed, and he
was told he could not leave, he joined the Austrian army as a volunteer,
the rupture he had suffered the previous year having exempted him from
compulsory service. ‘I think it is magnificent of him to have enlisted’,
wrote Pinsent in his diary, ‘but extremely sad and tragic.’</p>
<p>Although a patriot, Wittgenstein’s motives for enlisting in the army
were more complicated than a desire to defend his country. His sister
Hermine thought it had to do with: ‘an intense desire to take something
difficult upon himself and to do something other than purely
intellectual work’.16 It was linked to the desire he had felt so
intensely since January, to ‘turn into a different person’.</p>
<p>The metaphor he had then used to describe his emotional state serves
equally to describe the feeling that pervaded Europe during the summer
of 1914 – the sense of perpetual seething, and the hope that ‘things
will come to an eruption once and for all’. Hence the scenes of joy and
celebration that greeted the declaration of war in each of the
belligerent nations. The whole world, it seems, shared Wittgenstein’s
madness of 1914. In his autobiography, Russell describes how, walking
through the cheering crowds in Trafalgar Square, he was amazed to
discover that ‘average men and women were delighted at the prospect of
war’.17 Even some of his best friends, such as George Trevelyan and
Alfred North Whitehead, were caught up in the enthusiasm and became
‘savagely warlike’.</p>
<p>We should not imagine Wittgenstein greeting the news of war against
Russia with unfettered delight, or succumbing to the hysterical
xenophobia that gripped the European nations at this time. None the
less, that he in some sense welcomed the war seems indisputable, even
though this was primarily for personal rather than nationalistic
reasons. Like many of his generation (including, for example, some of
his contemporaries at Cambridge, such as Rupert Brooke, Frank Bliss and
Ferenc Békássy), Wittgenstein felt that the experience of facing death
would, in some way or other, improve him. He went to war, one could say,
not for the sake of his country, but for the sake of himself.</p>
<p>The spiritual value of facing death heroically is touched upon by
William James in Varieties of Religious Experience – a book which, as he
had told Russell in 1912, Wittgenstein thought might improve him in a
way in which he very much wanted to improve. ‘No matter what a man’s
frailties otherwise may be’, writes James:18</p>
<p>if he be willing to risk death, and still more if he suffer it
heroically, in the service he has chosen, the fact consecrates him
forever.</p>
<p>In the diaries Wittgenstein kept during the war (the personal parts
of which are written in a very simple code) there are signs that he
wished for precisely this kind of consecration. ‘Now I have the chance
to be a decent human being’, he wrote on the occasion of his first
glimpse of the enemy, ‘for I’m standing eye to eye with death.’19 It was
two years into the war before he was actually brought into the firing
line, and his immediate thought was of the spiritual value it would
bring. ‘Perhaps’, he wrote, ‘the nearness of death will bring light into
life. God enlighten me.’ What Wittgenstein wanted from the war, then,
was a transformation of his whole personality, a ‘variety of religious
experience’ that would change his life irrevocably. In this sense, the
war came for him just at the right time, at the moment when his desire
to ‘turn into a different person’ was stronger even than his desire to
solve the fundamental problems of logic.</p>
<p>He enlisted on 7 August, the day after the Austrian declaration of
war against Russia, and was assigned to an artillery regiment serving at
Kraków on the Eastern Front. He was immediately encouraged by the
kindness of the military authorities in Vienna. ‘People to whom
thousands come each day to ask advice replied kindly and in detail’, he
commented.20 It was a good sign; it reminded him of the English way of
doing things. He arrived in Kraków on 9 August in a state of excited
anticipation: ’Will I be able to work now??! I am anxious to know what
lies ahead.’21</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s regiment was assigned to the Austrian First Army, and
was therefore involved in one of the most absurdly incompetent campaigns
of the early months of the war. Both the Russian and the Austrian
commands pursued a strategy based on illusion: the Russians thought the
mass of Austrian troops would be centred on Lemberg (now Lwów); the
Austrians expected to find the bulk of Russian forces further north,
around Lublin. Thus, while the Austrian army made easy headway into
Russian Poland, the Russians advanced on Lemberg, the largest city in
Austrian Galicia, both forces surprised at how little resistance they
faced. By the time the Austrian commander, Conrad, realized what had
happened, Lemberg had fallen and his First Army was in grave danger of
being cut off from its supply lines by Russian troops to the south. He
was therefore forced to order a retreat. What had begun as a bold
offensive into Russian territory ended in an ignominious withdrawal to a
line 140 miles inside Austria-Hungary. Had the Austrian army not
withdrawn, however, it would have been annihilated by the numerically
stronger Russian forces. As it was, 350,000 men out of the 900,000 under
Conrad’s control died in the confused and fruitless Galician
campaign.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein spent most of this campaign on board a ship on the
Vistula river – the Goplana, captured from the Russians during the
initial advance. If he saw any active fighting during these first few
months, there is no record of it in his diary. We read instead of great
battles heard but not seen, and of rumours that ‘the Russians are at our
heels’. It is perhaps typical of Wittgenstein’s pessimism (justified in
this case) that he was all too ready to believe the stories coming in
that the Russians had taken Lemberg, but quick to disbelieve the rumour
that the Germans had taken Paris. From both stories he drew the same
conclusion: ‘Now I know that we are lost!’ The rumour about Paris,
particularly, prompted him, on 25 October, to reflect gloomily on the
situation of the Central Powers:</p>
<p>Such incredible news is always a bad sign.22 If something really had
gone well for us then that would be reported and people would not
succumb to such absurdities. Because of this, today, more than ever, I
feel the terrible sadness of our – the German race’s – situation. The
English – the best race in the world – cannot lose. We, however, can
lose, and will lose, if not this year then the next. The thought that
our race will be defeated depresses me tremendously, because I am German
through and through.</p>
<p>The fact that he was inclined to see the war in racial terms perhaps
goes some way towards explaining why he found it so difficult to get on
with the majority of his fellow crew members. The Austro-Hungarian army
was the most multi-racial of all the European armies. Although most of
its officers were Germans or Magyars, the bulk of its ordinary soldiers
came from the various subject Slavic nationalities of the empire.
Wittgenstein’s officers he found ‘kind, and at times very fine’, but as
soon as he met his crew mates he pronounced them ‘a bunch of
delinquents’: ’No enthusiasm for anything, unbelievably crude, stupid
and malicious.’23 He could barely see them as human beings:</p>
<p>When we hear a Chinese talk we tend to take his speech for
inarticulate gurgling.24 Someone who understands Chinese will recognize
language in what he hears. Similarly I often cannot discern the humanity
in a man.</p>
<p>Surrounded as he was by alien beings – and appearing to them equally
as alien – Wittgenstein found the situation rather like that he had
faced at school in Linz. On 10 August, the day after he collected his
uniform, the analogy had struck him in terms which suggest a repressed
anxiety brought suddenly to the surface: ‘Today, when I woke up I felt
as though I were in one of those dreams in which, unexpectedly and
absurdly, one finds oneself back at school.’25 And on the Goplana, after
having been jeered at by the crew, he wrote: ‘It was terrible. If there
is one thing I have found out it is this: in the whole crew there is not
one decent person’:26</p>
<p>There is an enormously difficult time ahead of me, for I am sold and
betrayed now just as I was long ago at school in Linz.27</p>
<p>His sense of isolation was made complete by the knowledge that the
people in his life who had helped him to overcome the feeling of
loneliness he had had since a pupil at Linz – Russell, Keynes, Pinsent –
were ‘on the other side’. ‘The last few days I have often thought of
Russell’, he wrote on 5 October. ‘Does he still think of me?’ He
received a letter from Keynes, but it was of a purely businesslike
nature, asking him what should happen after the war to the money that he
had arranged to give to Johnson.fn2 ‘It hurts to receive a letter of
business from one with whom one was once in confidence, and especially
in these times.’ But it was, above all, to Pinsent that his thoughts
turned: ’No news from David. I am completely abandoned. I think of
suicide.’28</p>
<p>To his few German and Austrian friends Wittgenstein sent greetings in
the form of military postcards, and received in reply letters of
encouragement and support. The Jolles family in Berlin, in particular,
were frequent and enthusiastic correspondents. Elderly and patriotic,
they took a vicarious pleasure in reading the news from the Front of
their ‘little Wittgenstein’, and, throughout the war, badgered him to
provide more detailed accounts of his exploits. ‘I have never thought of
you so often and with such joy in my heart as now’, wrote Stanislaus
Jolles on 25 October.29 ‘Let us hear from you often and soon.’ They ‘did
their bit’ by sending him regular parcels of chocolate, bread and
cigarettes.</p>
<p>From Frege, too, he received patriotic best wishes. ‘That you have
enlisted as a volunteer’, Frege wrote on 11 October:30</p>
<p>I read with particular satisfaction, and am amazed that you can still
dedicate yourself to scientific work. May it be granted to me to see you
return from the war in good health and to resume discussions with you.
Undoubtedly, we will then, in the end, come closer to each other and
understand one another better.</p>
<p>What saved him from suicide, however, was not the encouragement he
received from Jolles and Frege, but exactly the kind of personal
transformation, the religious conversion, he had gone to war to find. He
was, as it were, saved by the word. During his first month in Galicia,
he entered a bookshop, where he could find only one book: Tolstoy’s
Gospel in Brief. The book captivated him. It became for him a kind of
talisman: he carried it wherever he went, and read it so often that he
came to know whole passages of it by heart. He became known to his
comrades as ‘the man with the gospels’. For a time he – who before the
war had struck Russell as being ‘more terrible with Christians’ than
Russell himself – became not only a believer, but an evangelist,
recommending Tolstoy’s Gospel to anyone in distress. ‘If you are not
acquainted with it’, he later told Ficker, ’then you cannot imagine what
an effect it can have upon a person.’31</p>
<p>His logic and his thinking about himself being but two aspects of the
single ‘duty to oneself’, this fervently held faith was bound to have an
influence on his work. And eventually it did – transforming it from an
analysis of logical symbolism in the spirit of Frege and Russell into
the curiously hybrid work which we know today, combining as it does
logical theory with religious mysticism.</p>
<p>But such an influence does not become apparent until a few years
later. During the first few months of the war, the spiritual sustenance
that Wittgenstein derived from reading Tolstoy’s Gospel ‘kept him
alive’, in the sense that it allowed him, as he put it, to lighten his
external appearance, ‘so as to leave undisturbed my inner being’.</p>
<p>It allowed him, that is to say, to put into practice the thought that
had struck him while watching Die Kreuzelscheiber two (or three) years
previously – the idea that, whatever happened ‘externally’, nothing
could happen to him, to his innermost being. Thus we find in his diary
repeated exhortations to God to help him not to ‘lose himself’. This,
for him, was far more important than staying alive. What happened to his
body was – or, he felt, should have been – a matter of indifference. ‘If
I should reach my end now’, he wrote on 13 September (one of the days on
which it was reported that the Russians were advancing towards them),
‘may I die a good death, attending myself.32 May I never lose
myself.’</p>
<p>For Wittgenstein, the body belonged only to the ‘external world’ –
the world to which also belonged the ‘crude, stupid and malicious’
delinquents among whom he now lived. His soul, however, must inhabit an
entirely different realm. In November he told himself:</p>
<p>Don’t be dependent on the external world and then you have no fear of
what happens in it … It is x times easier to be independent of things
than to be independent of people.33 But one must be capable of that as
well.</p>
<p>His job on the ship was to man the searchlight at night. The
loneliness of the task made it much easier to achieve the independence
from people he considered necessary to endure the conditions on the
boat. ‘Through it’, he wrote, ‘I succeed in escaping the wickedness of
the comrades.’ Perhaps also his intense desire to distance himself from
his external surroundings made it easier for him to resume work on
logic. On 21 August he had wondered whether he would ever be able to
work again:</p>
<p>All the concepts of my work have become ‘foreign’ to me.34 I do not
SEE anything at all!!!</p>
<p>But during the following two weeks – a period spent working at night
on the searchlight, and the time during which he first began to read,
and find solace in, Tolstoy’s Gospel – he wrote a great deal. At the end
of these two weeks he remarked: ’I am on the path to a great discovery.
But will I reach it?’35</p>
<p>And yet, the separation between body and spirit was not complete. How
could it be? He could distance himself from his surroundings, even from
his fellow men, but he could not separate himself from his own body. In
fact, coincident with his renewed ability to work on logic, was a
revitalized sensuality. The almost jubilant remark quoted above is
followed by: ’I feel more sensual than before. Today I masturbated
again.’36 Two days previously he had recorded that he had masturbated
for the first time in three weeks, having until then felt almost no
sexual desire at all. The occasions on which he masturbated – though
clearly not an object of pride – are not recorded with any
self-admonition; they are simply noted, in a quite matter-of-fact way,
as one might record one’s state of health. What appears to emerge from
his diary is that his desire to masturbate and his ability to work were
complementary signs that he was, in a full sense, alive. One might
almost say that, for him, sensuality and philosophical thought were
inextricably linked – the physical and mental manifestations of
passionate arousal.</p>
<p>There are no coded remarks in Wittgenstein’s notebooks for the second
half of September, the time of the Austrian retreat. It was during this
time, however, that he made the great discovery he had felt was
imminent. This consisted of what is now known as the ‘Picture Theory of
language’ – the idea that propositions are a picture of the reality they
describe. The story of how this idea occurred to him was told by
Wittgenstein in later life to his friend G. H. von Wright, and has since
been retold many times.37 While serving on the Eastern Front, the story
goes, Wittgenstein read in a magazine a report of a lawsuit in Paris
concerning a car accident, in which a model of the accident was
presented before the court. It occurred to him that the model could
represent the accident because of the correspondence between the parts
of the model (the miniature houses, cars, people) and the real things
(houses, cars, people). It further occurred to him that, on this
analogy, one might say a proposition serves as a model, or picture, of a
state of affairs, by virtue of a similar correspondence between its
parts and the world. The way in which the parts of the proposition are
combined – the structure of the proposition – depicts a possible
combination of elements in reality, a possible state of affairs.</p>
<p>From Wittgenstein’s notebooks we can date this genesis of the Picture
Theory to somewhere around 29 September. On that day he wrote:</p>
<p>In the proposition a world is as it were put together
experimentally.38 (As when in the law-court in Paris a motor-car
accident is represented by means of dolls, etc.)</p>
<p>Throughout October, Wittgenstein developed the consequences of this
idea, which he called his ‘Theory of Logical Portrayal’. Just as a
drawing or a painting portrays pictorally, so, he came to think, a
proposition portrays logically. That is to say, there is – and must be –
a logical structure in common between a proposition (‘The grass is
green’) and a state of affairs (the grass being green), and it is this
commonality of structure which enables language to represent
reality:</p>
<p>We can say straight away: Instead of: this proposition has such and
such a sense: this proposition represents such and such a situation.39
It portrays it logically.</p>
<p>Only in this way can the proposition be true or false: It can only
agree or disagree with reality by being a picture of a situation.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein regarded this idea as an important breakthrough. It was,
so to speak, a valuable fortress that had to be taken if logic were to
be conquered. ‘Worked the whole day’, he wrote on 31 October:40</p>
<p>Stormed the problem in vain! But I would pour my blood before this
fortress rather than march off empty-handed. The greatest difficulty
lies in making secure fortresses already conquered. And as long as the
whole city has not fallen one cannot feel completely secure in one of
its fortifications.</p>
<p>But while he himself was on the offensive, the Austrian army was in
chaotic and disorderly retreat. The Goplana was making its way back
towards Kraków, deep inside Austrian territory, where the army was to be
quartered for the winter. Before they reached Kraków, Wittgenstein
received a note from the poet Georg Trakl, who was at the military
hospital there as a psychiatric patient. He had earlier been told of
Trakl’s situation by Ficker, who had been to Kraków to visit Trakl, and
from there had written to Wittgenstein asking him to pay the poet a
visit. Trakl felt extremely lonely, Ficker had written, and knew nobody
in Kraków who would visit him. ‘I would be greatly obliged’, Trakl
himself wrote, ‘if you would do me the honour of paying a visit … I will
possibly be able to leave the hospital in the next few days to return to
the field.41 Before a decision is reached, I would greatly like to speak
with you.’ Especially in his present company, Wittgenstein was delighted
by the invitation: ‘How happy I would be to get to know him! When I
arrive at Kraków I hope to meet him! He could be a great stimulus to
me.’42 On 5 November, the day that the Goplana finally arrived at
Kraków, he was: ‘thrilled with the anticipation and hope of meeting
Trakl’:</p>
<p>I miss greatly having people with whom I can communicate a little …
it would invigorate me a great deal … In Krakau.43 It is already too
late to visit Trakl today.</p>
<p>This final sentence is charged with the most terrible, unwitting,
irony. For as Wittgenstein found out the next morning when he rushed to
the hospital, it was indeed too late: Trakl had killed himself with an
overdose of cocaine on 3 November 1914, just two days before
Wittgenstein’s arrival. Wittgenstein was devastated: ‘Wie traurig, wie
traurig!!!’ (‘What unhappiness, what unhappiness!!!’) was all he could
find to say on the matter.</p>
<p>For the next few days Wittgenstein’s diary is full of the misery of
his life, the brutality of his surroundings and the failure of his
attempts to find a decent person to help him survive. Robbed of such a
person in Trakl, he turned his thoughts to Pinsent: ‘How often I think
of him! And whether he thinks of me half as much.’44 He discovered that
he could get mail through to England via Switzerland, and immediately
sent a letter to ‘the beloved David’. During the weeks that followed, he
waited impatiently for a reply. When a letter from Pinsent finally did
arrive, on 1 December, it came as such a relief that he kissed it.</p>
<p>In the letter Pinsent told Wittgenstein that he had tried to join the
British army but had failed the medical test for a private (‘I am too
thin’) and could not get a commission as an officer. So he was still,
reluctantly, reading for his examinations in law. ‘When this war is
over’, he wrote, ‘we will meet each other again.45 Let’s hope it will be
soon!’ ‘I think it was splendid of you to volunteer for the Army’, he
added, ‘though it is terribly tragic that it should be necessary.’</p>
<p>Wittgenstein answered straight away, and then waited with growing
impatience for the reply. And so it went on. ‘Keine Nachricht von David’
(‘No news from David’) and ‘Lieben Brief von David’ (‘Lovely letter from
David’) are phrases that appear repeatedly, throughout the winter, in
his diary.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s greatest worry about spending winter in Kraków was not
the cold (although he complains of that frequently), but the thought
that he would have to share sleeping quarters with the other men – ‘from
which’, he prayed, ‘may God release me’. In the event, his prayers were
answered: he was, to his enormous relief, promised a room of his own.
Even better, in December he was given an entirely new post, a chance to
rid himself once and for all of the ‘mass of scoundrels’ whose company
he had endured for four long months. He had wanted to join a balloon
section, but when it was discovered that he had a mathematical training
he was offered instead a job with an artillery workshop.</p>
<p>Actually, the task Wittgenstein was given at the workshop was mundane
clerical work, requiring no mathematical expertise and consisting of
compiling a list of all the vehicles in the barracks. For a while all he
had to report in his diary was ‘Ganzer Tag Kanzlei’ (‘At the office all
day’), which, so often did it recur, he began to abbreviate as ‘G.T.K.’.
The job had its compensations, however, not the least of which was a
decent room to himself: ’For the first time in 4 months I am alone in a
proper room!! A luxury I savour.’46 He was also, more important, among
people he could like and respect, and with whom he could communicate.
With his immediate superior, Oberleutnant Gürth, particularly, he formed
the nearest thing to a friendship he had yet experienced in the
army.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he now had people with whom he could converse, his
diary entries at this point become shorter and more formulaic. Apart
from ‘G.T.K.’, the other constant refrain is: ‘Nicht gearbeitet’ (‘Have
not worked’). Paradoxically (but, upon reflection, perhaps not
surprisingly), focussing his mind on logic after a long day at the
office among congenial colleagues was more difficult than it had been
while he was facing death manning a searchlight amid heavy fighting, and
living among people whom he detested. At the workshop he had neither the
opportunity nor the desire for the complete solitude he needed for
absorption in philosophical problems.</p>
<p>He managed, however, to do some reading. In November he had begun to
read Emerson’s Essays. ‘Perhaps’, he thought, ’they will have a good
influence on me.’47 Whether they did, he does not say, and Emerson is
not mentioned again in his diary. Certainly there is no trace of
Emerson’s influence in the work that he wrote at this (or indeed at any
other) time.</p>
<p>More stimulating was a writer whose view could not have been more
antithetical to the Tolstoyan Christianity that Wittgenstein had come to
embrace: Friedrich Nietzsche. Wittgenstein had bought in Kraków the
eighth volume of Nietzsche’s collected works, the one that includes The
Anti-Christ, Nietzsche’s blistering attack upon Christianity. In it,
Nietzsche rails against the Christian faith as a decadent, corrupt
religion, ‘a form of mortal hostility to reality as yet unsurpassed’.
Christianity has its origins, according to him, in the weakest and
basest aspects of human psychology, and is at root no more than a
cowardly retreat from a hostile world:</p>
<p>We recognize a condition of morbid susceptibility of the sense of
touch which makes it shrink back in horror from every contact, every
grasping of a firm object.48 Translate such a psychological habitus into
its ultimate logic – as instinctive hatred of every reality, as flight
into the ‘ungraspable’, into the ‘inconceivable’, as antipathy towards
every form, every spatial and temporal concept, towards everything firm…
as being at home in a world undisturbed by reality of any kind, a merely
‘inner world’, a ‘real’ world, an ‘eternal’ world… ‘The kingdom of God
is within you’…</p>
<p>This hatred of reality, and the idea to which it gives rise, of the
need for redemption through the love of God, are, in Nietzsche’s view,
the consequence of: ’an extreme capacity for suffering and irritation
which no longer wants to be “touched” at all because it feels every
contact too deeply… The fear of pain, even of the infinitely small in
pain – cannot end otherwise than in a religion of love.’49</p>
<p>Though ‘strongly affected’ by Nietzsche’s hostility towards
Christianity, and though he felt obliged to admit some truth in
Nietzsche’s analysis, Wittgenstein was unshaken in his belief that:
‘Christianity is indeed the only sure way to happiness’:50</p>
<p>… but what if someone spurned this happiness? Might it not be better
to perish unhappily in the hopeless struggle against the external world?
But such a life is senseless. But why not lead a senseless life? Is it
unworthy?</p>
<p>Even from this it can be seen how close Wittgenstein was, despite his
faith, to accepting Nietzsche’s view. He is content to discuss the issue
in Nietzsche’s psychological terms; he does not see it as a question of
whether Christianity is true, but of whether it offers some help in
dealing with an otherwise unbearable and meaningless existence. In
William James’s terms, the question is whether it helps to heal the
‘sick soul’. And the ‘it’ here is not a belief but a practice, a way of
living. This is a point that Nietzsche puts well:</p>
<p>It is false to the point of absurdity to see in a ‘belief’, perchance
the belief in redemption through Christ, the distinguishing
characteristic of the Christian: only Christian practice, a life such as
he who died on the Cross lived, is Christian… Even today such a life is
possible, for certain men even necessary: genuine, primitive
Christianity will be possible at all times…Not a belief but a doing,
above all a not-doing of many things, a different being… States of
consciousness, beliefs of any kind, holding something to be true for
example – every psychologist knows this – are a matter of complete
indifference and of the fifth rank compared with the value of the
instincts… To reduce being a Christian, Christianness, to a holding of
something to be true, to a mere phenomenality of consciousness, means to
negate Christianness.51</p>
<p>This, we may feel sure, was one of the passages in The Anti-Christ
that persuaded Wittgenstein that there was some truth in Nietzsche’s
work. The idea that the essence of religion lay in feelings (or, as
Nietzsche would have it, instincts) and practices rather than in beliefs
remained a constant theme in Wittgenstein’s thought on the subject for
the rest of his life. Christianity was for him (at this time) ‘the only
sure way to happiness’ – not because it promised an after-life, but
because, in the words and the figure of Christ, it provided an example,
an attitude, to follow, that made suffering bearable.</p>
<p>In the winter months of 1914–15 we read little more in Wittgenstein’s
diary about his faith. There are no more calls to God to give him
strength, no more entries that end: ‘Thy will be done.’ To bear life in
the workshop, it seems, required no divine assistance. Apart from the
fact that he had very little time to himself to work on philosophy, life
was almost pleasant, at least by comparison with the previous four
months.</p>
<p>In any case, it was preferable to life in Vienna. The fact that he
had no leave at Christmas to visit his family troubled him not a bit. On
Christmas Eve he was promoted to Militärbeamter (‘Military Official’);
on Christmas Day he was invited to a meal in the officers’ mess; and on
Boxing Day he went out in the evening to a café with a young man he had
got to know and like, who had been at college in Lemberg. So passed his
Yuletide – quietly, and apparently without any longing to be at home
with his family. Through the military post he received Christmas
greetings from Jolles (complete, of course, with a chocolate parcel),
from the Klingenberg family in Norway, and from Frege. (‘Let us hope’,
wrote Frege, ’for the victory of our warriors and for a lasting peace in
the coming year.’52)</p>
<p>On New Year’s Eve, however, Wittgenstein was suddenly told that he
had to accompany his superior officer, Oberleutnant Gürth, on a visit to
Vienna, where Gürth had some official business to attend to.
Wittgenstein’s mother was, naturally, delighted by the surprise visit.
From his diary, one gathers that Wittgenstein himself retained a cold
aloofness. On being reunited with his family, he remarks only that, as
New Year’s Day was taken up entirely with being with them, he had
managed to do no work. He adds, with dispassion (and apparent
irrelevance): ‘I wish to note that my moral standing is much lower now
than it was, say, at Easter.’53 Of the ten days that he was in Vienna,
two of them were spent with Labor, the by now elderly composer, and much
of the rest of the time with Gürth. When he arrived back in Kraków his
only comment on the visit was that he had ‘spent many pleasant hours
with Gürth’.54</p>
<p>This coolness towards his family suggests a determination not to let
them intrude on his inner life, and a fear, perhaps, that to do so would
risk undoing the advances he had made in self-discovery and
self-possession during his experience of the war. But it seems also to
be part of a more general lethargy. He remarks on his exhaustion
frequently during this period, especially in relation to his work. On 13
January, for example, he comments that he is not working with any great
energy:</p>
<p>My thoughts are tired. I am not seeing things freshly, but rather in
a pedestrian, lifeless way.55 It is as if a flame had gone out and I
must wait until it starts to burn again by itself.</p>
<p>He was dependent, he thought, on an external source of inspiration:
’Only through a miracle can my work succeed. Only if the veil before my
eyes is lifted from the outside. I have to surrender myself completely
to my fate. As it has been destined for me, so will it be. I am in the
hands of fate.’56</p>
<p>His thoughts turned once more to his English friends. He wrote to
Pinsent again, and waited impatiently for a reply. ‘When will I hear
something from David?!’ his diary pleads on 19 January.57 He received a
letter from Keynes, but pronounced it ‘not very good’. It was, in fact,
a very friendly note, but perhaps its tone was too flippant to be of any
real comfort. ‘I hope you have been safely taken prisoner by now’,
Keynes wrote:58</p>
<p>Russell and I have given up philosophy for the present – I to give my
services to the govt. for financial business, he to agitate for peace.
But Moore and Johnson go on just as usual. Russell, by the way, brought
out a nice book at about the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>Pinsent had not joined the army by the middle of October but I have
not heard since.</p>
<p>Your dear friend Békássy is in your army and your very dear friend
Bliss is a private in ours.</p>
<p>It must be much pleasanter to be at war than to think about
propositions in Norway. But I hope you will stop such self-indulgence
soon.</p>
<p>Finally, on 6 February, Wittgenstein was able to announce: ‘Lovely
letter from David!’59 The letter had been written on 14 January; in it
Pinsent says he has little to say, ‘except that I hope to God we shall
see each other again after the War’.60 In contrast to the affectionate,
but none the less distancing, ‘cleverness’ of Keynes’s letter, this
straightforward expression of friendship was exactly what was craved and
needed.</p>
<p>More to Wittgenstein’s taste also were probably the short notes he
received from the villagers in Skjolden: Halvard Draegni, Arne Bolstad
and the Klingenberg family. ‘Thanks for your card. We are all healthy.
Speak of you often’, runs a typical card from Draegni. Wittgenstein’s
replies were no doubt just as brief, and just as warmly received. The
news from Norway was that work on his hut had been completed. ‘We all
hope’, wrote Klingenberg, ‘that you will soon be able to return to your
new house, which is now finished.’61 Wittgenstein paid the workers via
Draegni, who was surprised to be sent the money; he had not expected
Wittgenstein to pay, he wrote, until his return. Draegni was apologetic
about the cost: ‘If one wants to build as solidly as you have had it
made’, he explained, ’it will always be more expensive than one
initially reckons.’62</p>
<p>At the beginning of February Wittgenstein was put in charge of the
forge in the workshop, and this added responsibility made it even harder
for him to concentrate on philosophy. Apart from having to spend more
time in the forge, his supervisory role imposed on him more trouble with
his workmates. He was presumably chosen for this task because of his
superior engineering skills, but even so it was difficult for him to
assume the role of foreman. He reports many difficulties with the men
whose work he was supervising, some of which led to great
unpleasantness. On one occasion he came close to a duel with a young
officer who, one supposes, disliked being told what to do by someone of
inferior rank. The effort of trying to impose his will on an
intransigent workforce, which neither respected his rank nor were
willing to accept the authority of his superior knowledge, drained him
of all his energy and strained his nerves almost to breaking point.
After only a month of the job – a month in which he had written almost
no philosophy at all – Wittgenstein was suicidal, despairing of ever
being able to work again.</p>
<p>‘One cannot go on like this’, he wrote on 17 February. It was clear
that something had to change: he had either to be promoted, or
transferred to another post. He began to petition Gürth for a change in
his situation, but, whether through inefficiency or neglect, nothing was
done for a very long time. To add to the constant refrain of ‘Nicht
gearbeitet’, a new phrase finds its way into the diary at this point:
‘Lage unverändert’ (‘Situation unchanged’). It must be this period that
Hermine had in mind when, in speaking of Wittgenstein’s war experiences,
she wrote of his repeated efforts to be sent to the Front, and of the
‘comical misunderstandings which resulted from the fact that the
military authorities with which he had to deal always assumed that he
was trying to obtain an easier posting for himself when in fact what he
wanted was to be given a more dangerous one’.63</p>
<p>It is possible, I think, that Wittgenstein’s requests to join the
infantry were not so much misunderstood as ignored, and that he was
perceived to be of more use to the army as a skilled engineer in charge
of a repair depot than as an ordinary foot-soldier. Throughout March,
despite repeated entreaties to Gürth, his situation remained
unchanged.</p>
<p>Philosophically, the first three months of 1915 were almost
completely barren. In other respects, too, Wittgenstein felt dead,
unresponsive. (It puzzled him, however, that at such a time, when
nothing else moved in him, he could feel sensual and have the desire to
masturbate.) When, in February, Ficker sent a posthumously published
edition of Trakl’s works, his only comment was strikingly dull:
‘probably very good’.64 Thanking Ficker for the volume, he explained
that he was now in a sterile period and had ‘no desire to assimilate
foreign thoughts’.65 There was, however, something to be hoped for, even
from his very unresponsiveness:</p>
<p>I have this only during a decline of productivity, not when it has
completely ceased. However – UNFORTUNATELY I now feel completely burnt
out. One just has to be patient.</p>
<p>He had, he thought, just to wait for God, for the spirit, to help and
inspire him.</p>
<p>Having, in the meantime, nothing to say, he fell silent. From Adele
Jolles he received a letter gently berating him for the brevity of his
communications from the field. One thing is certain, she told him – he
would not make a satisfactory war correspondent or telegraphist.
Couldn’t he, for once, send a decent letter, so that one could know
where he was and how he was and what he was doing? What did he think of
the Italians? Weren’t they a pack of scoundrels, deserting the Triple
Alliance as they had? ‘If I were to write what I think of them’, she
said, ‘my letter would most likely not get through the censors.’66 She
kept up the supply of bread, chocolate and fruit cake, evidently taking
pride in the part her ‘little Wittgenstein’ was playing in the struggle.
‘That you willingly volunteered’, she told him, ‘pleases me ever
anew.’</p>
<p>Her husband took pride in the fact that Wittgenstein was at last in a
position to put his technical knowledge to some use. ‘In any case’, he
wrote, ‘with your skills you are at the right place and, what with the
awful Galician roads there must surely be autos aplenty to repair!’
Wittgenstein evidently replied that he would rather be with the infantry
at the Front than repairing cars behind the lines.67 Jolles was
surprised: ‘Don’t you think that you could use your technical talents
more in the workshop?’ His wife, too, despite her patriotic fervour, was
concerned: ‘Hopefully, your wish to go to the Front will not be
fulfilled’, she wrote, with motherly anxiety; ‘there you are one of very
many, and not one of the strongest, here you can play your part more
safely.’</p>
<p>Such concern, though no doubt welcome, and perhaps even necessary,
was not sufficient. And it was not until after he had received a letter
from Pinsent that Wittgenstein was able to shake off his lethargy. On 16
March he was again able to write in his diary: ‘Lovely letter from
David.’ And: ’Answered David. Very sensual.’68 A draft of a reply has
been preserved. It reads:</p>
<p>My dear Davy,</p>
<p>Got today your letter dated January 27th. This is about the limit.
I’m now beginning to be more fertile again.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had asked Pinsent to pass on a message to Moore, and to
explain to him how to get a letter through. This Pinsent had done, and
‘I hope he will write to you.’69 It was a forlorn hope. ‘I am so sorry
if Moore won’t behave like a Christian’, Pinsent wrote in April; ’as a
matter of fact he never acknowledged my letter.’70</p>
<p>Not that Moore could keep Wittgenstein out of his thoughts entirely.
On 12 October 1915 he recorded in his diary: ‘Dream of
Wittgenstein’:71</p>
<p>… he looks at me as if to ask if it is all right, and I can’t help
smiling as if it was, though I know it isn’t; then he is swimming in the
sea; finally he is trying to escape arrest as an enemy alien.</p>
<p>On 22 April Wittgenstein was put in charge of the whole workshop, but
this, he reports, merely presented him with more unpleasantness to deal
with. To help ease the situation he was allowed by Gürth to wear the
uniform of an engineer and was provisionally given that title.fn3</p>
<p>On 30 April Wittgenstein records another ‘lovely letter from David’,
which contained a piece of perhaps surprising news. ‘I have been writing
a paper on Philosophy’, Pinsent told him, ‘probably absolute rot!’ It
was, he said, an attempt to explain ‘what Logic as a whole is about and
what “Truth” is andandandand “Knowledge”’.72 Though its subject-matter
is identical to Wittgenstein’s, the resultant work (which still
survives) bears little resemblance either to the Tractatus or to the
earlier Notes on Logic. Logic is defined by Pinsent using the notion of
‘consistency’ rather than that of ‘tautology’, and the general tenor of
its thought owes more to the British empirical tradition (particularly
to Moore and Russell) than to Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Pinsent
himself clearly thought of it as a contribution to the issues with which
Wittgenstein was concerned. ‘I wish you were here andandandand could
talk it over with me’, he wrote. His letter ends:</p>
<p>I wish to God this horrible tragedy would end, andandandand I am
longing to see you again.</p>
<p>Whether inspired by Pinsent’s letter or not, it is remarkable that
during his last few months at Kraków – at a time when he was desperately
unhappy and intensely frustrated at not being able to obtain another
position – Wittgenstein found himself able to work again with renewed
vigour. Throughout the months of May and June he was prolific. A large
part (approximately a third) of the remarks published as Notebooks:
1914–1916 were written during this period.</p>
<p>The problem with which he was principally concerned during this time
was that of how language pictures the world – what features of both
language and the world make it possible for this picturing to take
place:</p>
<p>The great problem round which everything I write turns is: Is there
an order in the world a priori, and if so what does it consist in?73</p>
<p>Almost against his will, he was forced to the conclusion that there
was such an order: the world, as he had insisted to Russell, consists of
facts, not of things – that is, it consists of things (objects) standing
in certain relations to one another. These facts – the relations that
exist between objects – are mirrored, pictured, by the relations between
the symbols of a proposition. But if language is analysable into atomic
propositions (as he had earlier insisted), then it looks as though there
must be atomic facts corresponding to those atomic propositions. And
just as atomic propositions are those that are incapable of being
analysed any further, atomic facts are relations between simple rather
than complex objects. Wittgenstein could produce no examples of either
an atomic proposition or an atomic fact, nor could he say what a ‘simple
object’ was, but he felt that the very possibility of analysis demanded
that there be such things, providing the structure of both language and
the world, which allowed the one to mirror the other.</p>
<p>It does not go against our feeling, that we cannot analyse
PROPOSITIONS so far as to mention the elements by name: no, we feel that
the world must consist of elements.74 And it appears as if that were
identical with the proposition that the world must be what it is, it
must be definite.</p>
<p>We can be indefinite and uncertain, but surely the world cannot be:
‘The world has a fixed structure.’ And this allows the possibility of
language having a definite meaning: ’The demand for simple things is the
demand for definiteness of sense.’75</p>
<p>In the middle of this philosophically fruitful period, Wittgenstein
received a letter from Russell, written in German and dated 10 May.
Russell had, he told Wittgenstein, seen the notes dictated to Moore in
Norway but had found them difficult to understand. ‘I hope’, he wrote,
‘with all my heart that after the war you will explain everything to me
orally.’76 ‘Since the war began’, he added, ‘it has been impossible for
me to think of philosophy.’</p>
<p>‘I’m extremely sorry that you weren’t able to understand Moore’s
notes’, Wittgenstein replied:77</p>
<p>I feel that they’re very hard to understand without further
explanation, but I regard them essentially as definitive. And now I’m
afraid that what I’ve written recently will be still more
incomprehensible, and if I don’t live to see the end of this war I must
be prepared for all my work to go to nothing. – In that case you must
get my manuscript printed whether anyone understands it or not.</p>
<p>‘The problems are becoming more and more lapidary and general’, he
told Russell, ‘and the method has changed drastically.’ The book was to
undergo a far more drastic change over the next two years, strangely
enough in a way that was prefigured by the development of Pinsent’s
treatise. In a letter dated 6 April (which Wittgenstein would probably
have received some time in May) Pinsent writes that his paper on
philosophy has expanded from logic to ‘ethics and philosophy in
general’. The following year Wittgenstein’s own work was to move in a
similar direction.</p>
<p>The revitalization of Wittgenstein’s work on logic coincided with a
dramatic improvement in the position of the Central Powers on the
Eastern Front. In March the plight of the Austro-Hungarians had looked
desperate. The Russians were forcing them further back into the
Carpathian mountains and threatening an incursion into Hungary itself.
On 22 March the fortress town of Przemyśl fell, and it was clear that,
if disaster were to be avoided, the Austrians would need the help of the
superior strength and efficiency of their German allies. Throughout
April preparations were thus made for a massive combined German and
Austrian assault in Galicia, which on 1 May was launched under the
leadership of the German General, von Mackensen. The place chosen to
launch the offensive was an area between the localities of Gorlice and
Tarnów. The success of the attack surprised even its planners, and a
decisive breakthrough was achieved. Throughout the summer months of 1915
the German and Austrian forces swept through the Russian defences with
remarkable ease, eventually advancing their position by some 300 miles.
Przemyśl and Lemberg were retaken, and Lublin, Warsaw and Brest Litovsk
were captured.</p>
<p>If Wittgenstein took any pleasure in the Gorlice-Tarnów breakthrough,
there is no indication of it in his diary. Throughout the advance he
remained at the workshop in Kraków, growing increasingly resentful of
the fact. In Jolles, however, he had a correspondent who could always be
relied upon to enthuse over a military success. On 25 March Jolles had
written to lament the fall (‘after brave resistence’) of Przemyśl, and
to hope that poor Galicia would be freed from the Russians in the
spring. Throughout the campaign Jolles’s letters read like a patriotic
commentary on the news from the Eastern Front. ‘It looks as if the
Russian offensive in the Carpathians has ground to a halt’,78 he wrote
on 16 April; ‘perhaps the occupied part of Galicia can now be
successfully liberated!’ On 4 May he wrote to say that he had heard a
great victory was expected as a result of Mackensen’s success: ’May poor
Galicia soon be set free from the Russians!’79</p>
<p>In the light of Mackensen’s breakthrough, he wrote on 17 May, he
could understand only too well Wittgenstein’s urge to go to the Front.
His wife was more concerned about Wittgenstein’s safety and whether he
was getting enough to eat. ‘I write rarely’, she explained on 8 April,
‘because you yourself write so rarely and so stereotypically, always
using the same few words – one has the feeling that you are hardly
interested in what one has to write.’80 ‘I am pleased’, she added, ‘that
you are not going to the Front and will instead stay where you are.’ In
every letter she asked whether food was scarce and whether Wittgenstein
needed anything. In his replies Wittgenstein spoke vaguely of the
‘unpleasantness’ with which he had to deal. ‘What kind of
unpleasantness?’ A dele Jolles asked.81 ‘We are sorry to hear that you
have much to cope with, but that you bear it so courageously is splendid
and pleases me most sincerely.’</p>
<p>In July he received a letter from Ficker, who was by this time
himself in the Austrian army, serving in an Alpine regiment stationed at
Brixen. The conditions under which he lived were frightful, Ficker
complained: thirty-six men to a room, no chance to be alone at any time
of the day or night – and it was likely to stay like that until
September. He complained of sleeplessness and spiritual exhaustion; he
was so weary he could hardly read or write. ’Sometimes, dear friend, it
is as though my whole being were exhausted … So thoroughly have these
circumstances already undermined my resistance.’82</p>
<p>The tone sounded familiar. Wittgenstein replied with a piece of
advice based on his own experience of a similar despair. ‘I understand
your sad news all too well’, he wrote:83</p>
<p>You are living, as it were, in the dark and have not found the saving
word. And if I, who am essentially so different from you, should offer
some advice, it might seem asinine. However, I am going to venture it
anyway. Are you acquainted with Tolstoi’s The Gospel in Brief? At its
time, this book virtually kept me alive. Would you buy the book and read
it?! If you are not acquainted with it, then you cannot imagine what an
effect it can have upon a person.</p>
<p>Perhaps surprisingly, this advice was enthusiastically received. ‘God
protect you!’ Ficker replied. Yes, Wittgenstein was right, he was living
in the dark: ‘for no one had given me the word’. And Wittgenstein had
not only given him the word, but also in such a way that he would never
forget it: ’God protect you!’84</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s letter to Ficker was written in hospital. As a result
of an explosion at the workshop he had suffered a nervous shock and a
few light injuries. After about a week in hospital he took a much needed
three-week leave in Vienna. ‘Three weeks’ holiday’, clucked Adele
Jolles, ’after over a year’s service and then after an injury and
illness is really rather little.’85 It was, however, probably more than
enough from his point of view.</p>
<p>By the time he returned to the repair unit, it had moved from Kraków.
In the wake of the Gorlice-Tarnów breakthrough, it had been relocated to
Sokal, north of Lemberg, and was housed in an artillery workshop train
at the railway station there.</p>
<p>No notebooks have survived from Wittgenstein’s time at Sokal, but
there is reason to think that it was for him a comparatively happy
period. He had at least one fairly close friend, a Dr Max Bieler, who
was in charge of a Red Cross hospital train which stood next to the
workshop train. Bieler first met Wittgenstein when he was invited to
take his meals with the officers at the workshop. He recalls:</p>
<p>Already during the first meal strikes my eye among the participants
who were all officers, a lean and quick man, without military rank, of
about twenty-five years.86 He ate little, drank little and did not
smoke, while the rest of the table companions stuffed themselves and
were very noisy. I asked my table neighbour and he informed me that his
name was Ludwig Wittgenstein. I was glad to find among the very young
empty-headed career officers a man with a university culture and so
sympathetic a man besides. I had the impression that he does not belong
in this atmosphere; he was there because he must. I think the sympathy
was mutual, because after the meal he invited me to visit his enclosure
in the train. And so began our friendship, that lasted several months
(almost a year) with daily hour-long conversations, without whisky or
cigarettes. After a few days he proposed me to ‘thou’ him.</p>
<p>During the autumn of 1915 and throughout the following winter, when
almost everything was in short supply and conditions at the Front were
extremely harsh, the friendship between Bieler and Wittgenstein was of
enormous comfort to them both. They had long and animated conversations
on philosophical and metaphysical subjects, although, perhaps not
surprisingly, these conversations were conducted on terms that were not
quite equal. Wittgenstein once told Bieler that he would make a good
disciple but that he was no prophet. ‘I could say about him’, writes
Bieler, that: ‘he had all the characteristics of a prophet, but none of
a disciple.’</p>
<p>Militarily it was a quiet time, with the Russians having to regroup
after the disaster of the previous summer, and the Central Powers
content to hold their position while they concentrated on the Western
Front. It was, evidently, a quiet time too for the repair unit.
Wittgenstein, pleased with the results of his recent work on logic, was
able to make a preliminary attempt to work it into a book. This, the
first version of the Tractatus, has unfortunately not survived. We learn
of its existence only in a letter to Russell dated 22 October 1915, in
which he tells Russell that he is now in the process of writing the
results of his work down in the form of a treatise. ‘Whatever happens’,
he told Russell, ’I won’t publish anything until you have seen it.’87
That, of course, could not happen until after the war:</p>
<p>But who knows whether I shall survive until then? If I don’t survive,
get my people to send you all my manuscripts: among them you’ll find the
final summary written in pencil on loose sheets of paper. It will
perhaps cost you some trouble to understand it all, but don’t let
yourself be put off by that.</p>
<p>Russell’s reply is dated 25 November. ‘I am enormously pleased’, he
wrote, ‘that you are writing a treatise which you want to publish.’88 He
was impatient to see it, and told Wittgenstein that it was hardly
necessary to wait until the end of the war. Wittgenstein could send it
to America, to Ralph Perry at Harvard, who had, through Russell, already
learnt of Wittgenstein’s earlier theories of logic. Perry could then
send it on to Russell who would publish it. ‘How nice it will be when we
finally see each other again!’ Russell ended.</p>
<p>Frege, too, was told of Wittgenstein’s treatise. On 28 November he
wrote, in similar vein to Russell: ‘I am pleased that you still have
time and energy left for scientific work.’89 If Wittgenstein had
followed Russell’s suggestion, the work that would have been published
in 1916 would have been, in many ways, similar to the work we now know
as the Tractatus. It would, that is, have contained the Picture Theory
of meaning, the metaphysics of ‘logical atomism’, the analysis of logic
in terms of the twin notions of tautology and contradiction, the
distinction between saying and showing (invoked to make the Theory of
Types superfluous), and the method of Truth-Tables (used to show a
logical proposition to be either a tautology or a contradiction). In
other words, it would have contained almost everything the Tractatus now
contains – except the remarks at the end of the book on ethics,
aesthetics, the soul, and the meaning of life.</p>
<p>In a way, therefore, it would have been a completely different
work.</p>
<p>The years during which the book underwent its final – and most
important – transformation were years in which Wittgenstein and Russell
were not in touch with one another. After the letter of 22 October 1915,
Russell heard no more from Wittgenstein until February 1919, after
Wittgenstein had been taken prisoner by the Italians. In his
Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy, written during the final year
of the war (while he himself was in prison, serving a sentence for
having allegedly jeopardized Britain’s relations with the United
States), Russell raises the question of how ‘tautology’ should be
defined, and appends the following footnote:</p>
<p>The importance of ‘tautology’ for a definition of mathematics was
pointed out to me by my former pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was
working on the problem.90 I do not know whether he has solved it, or
even whether he is alive or dead.</p>
<p>Communication with Pinsent also stopped for the last two years of the
war. On 2 September 1915 Pinsent wrote to say that he had ‘given up the
study of that damned Law’, and was now working for the government.
During 1916 Pinsent managed to get three letters through – all written
in German – the first of which emphasizes that: ‘the war cannot change
our personal relationships, it has nothing to do with them’. In these
letters Pinsent tells Wittgenstein that he has now received some
mechanical training and is employed as an engineer. The last letter
Wittgenstein received from him is dated 14 September 1916.</p>
<p>The change in the conception of the book – and the accompanying
transformation of Wittgenstein himself – came, then, at a time when he
was cut off from his English friends. It is therefore not surprising
that, after the war, he was doubtful whether his English friends would
be able to understand him. What did they know – what could they know –
of the circumstances that had produced the change in him?</p>
<p>An anticipation of the nature of this change can perhaps be seen in
the discussions he had in Sokal with Bieler – discussions that, Bieler
says, ‘sometimes absorbed us so completely that we lost sight of place
and time’:91</p>
<p>I remember one comical incident. It was New Year’s Eve 1915. The
local Commandant had invited us all to the Officers’ Mess for the New
Year’s celebrations. When supper was over, getting on for 10 o’clock,
the two of us retired to Wittgenstein’s room in order to resume
yesterday’s theme. At about 11 o’clock the officers from the train let
us know that it was time to set off in order to arrive at the party in
good time. Wittgenstein conveyed to them that they should simply go and
we would follow immediately. We quickly forgot about the invitation and
the time and continued our discussion until loud voices became audible
outside. It was our comrades, returning merrily at 4 a.m. – and we
thought it was not yet midnight. The next day we had to make our excuses
to the local Commandant and pay him our New Year’s compliments
belatedly.</p>
<p>Such intensity suggests a wholehearted commitment on Wittgenstein’s
part. And yet the subject of these discussions was not logic:
Wittgenstein did not attempt to teach Bieler, as he had earlier
attempted to teach Pinsent, the results of his work. They talked instead
of Tolstoy’s Gospel and of Dostoevsky’s Brothers Karamazov. The latter
Wittgenstein read so often he knew whole passages of it by heart,
particularly the speeches of the elder Zossima, who represented for him
a powerful Christian ideal, a holy man who could ‘see directly into the
souls of other people’.</p>
<p>The period during which Wittgenstein and Bieler were together was one
of the quietest times on the Eastern Front. It was, for Wittgenstein, a
time of relative comfort. Although not an officer, he was in many ways
treated like one. He was even provided with a servant – a young Russian
boy from a nearby prisoner-of-war camp called Constantin. Bieler
recalls: ’Constantin was a good boy and took care of Wittgenstein with
great zeal. Wittgenstein treated him very well and in a short time the
lean, frail, and dirty prisoner of war was transformed into the most
fleshy and cleanest soldier of the whole garrison.’92</p>
<p>This period of comparative serenity ended in March 1916, when the
Russians, to relieve the pressure on France, launched an attack on the
Baltic flank. At the same time, after over a year, a decision was
reached by the Austrian authorities on Wittgenstein’s status. It was
decided that he could not retain the title or the uniform of an
Ingenieur, but that he could be granted his long-expressed wish to be
posted to the Front as an ordinary soldier. The decision came, says
Bieler, as ‘a heavy blow to us both’.93 Wittgenstein parted from him in
the manner of one who did not expect to return alive:</p>
<p>He took with him only what was absolutely necessary, leaving
everything else behind and asking me to divide it among the troops. On
this occasion he told me that he had had a house built beside a
Norwegian fjord where he would sometimes take refuge in order to have
peace for his work. He now wanted to make me a present of this house. I
refused it and took in its place a Waterman’s fountain pen.</p>
<p>One of the few personal possessions Wittgenstein packed was a copy of
The Brothers Karamazov.</p>
<p>If he thought that he would not return from the Front alive, he knew
with certainty that he could not return unchanged. In this sense the war
really began for him in March 1916.</p>
<p>fn1 Kraus had written of Ficker’s journal: ‘That Austria’s only
honest review is published in Innsbruck should be known, if not in
Austria, at least in Germany, whose only honest review is published in
Innsbruck also.’5 Der Brenner had been started in 1910. Its name echoes
that of Kraus’s journal (‘The Torch’), and announces its intention of
extending the work of Kraus. Where Kraus satirized the shoddy thinking
and writing prevalent in Austria, Ficker attempted to publish work that
was free from shoddiness. His greatest success, and perhaps his greatest
claim to fame, was that he was the first to recognize the genius of the
poet Georg Trakl. From October 1912 to July 1914, no issue of Der
Brenner appeared without Trakl’s work. He also published the work of
Hermann Broch, Else Lasker-Schüler, Carl Dallago and Theodor Haecker,
and Der Brenner had, by the time Wittgenstein wrote to Ficker,
established a reputation as one of the leading literary journals of the
German avant-garde.</p>
<p>fn2 Before the war Wittgenstein had arranged with Keynes to donate
£200 a year to a research fund administered by King’s College to help
Johnson continue in his work on logic.</p>
<p>fn3 Wittgenstein’s status had still not been made official when,
following the breakthrough of the Central Powers forces on the Eastern
Front in the late summer of 1915, the whole depot was moved further
north to Sokal, north of Lemberg.</p>
