<h4 id="finis-austriae">19 FINIS AUSTRIAE</h4>
<p>IN DECEMBER 1937, just as in July 1914, Wittgenstein arrived back in
Austria from Norway at a critical moment in his country’s history. As
the earlier crisis had led to the end of the Habsburg Empire, so the
present crisis was to lead to the end of Austria itself.</p>
<p>That Hitler had both the intention and the means to incorporate
Austria into his German Reich should, in December 1937, have been no
surprise to anyone who cared to think about it. Mein Kampf had been in
print since 1925, and on its very first page Hitler declares:
‘German-Austria must return to the great German mother country … One
blood demands one Reich.’1 And, a few pages later: ‘in my earliest youth
I came to the basic insight which has never left me, but only became
more profound: That Germanism could be safeguarded only by the
destruction of Austria.’2 After the failure of the attempted Nazi Putsch
of 1934, Hitler had been pursuing this policy of the destruction of
Austria by ‘legal’ means, and in the treaty for the ‘Normalization of
Relations between Austria and Germany’ of July 1936, Austria had
acknowledged itself to be a ‘German State’, and the Austrian Chancellor,
Schuschnigg, had had to admit into his cabinet two Nazi members of the
‘Nationalist Opposition’. Hitler’s subsequent repudiation of the
Versailles Treaty, his rearmament campaign, and the unwillingness of
Britain, France, Russia and Italy to intervene made it inevitable that
this Nazi opposition would one day govern Austria, not as an independent
country, but as part of Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>With very few exceptions, the large Jewish population of Vienna were
slow to realize – or, perhaps, reluctant to admit to themselves – the
likely consequences of the impending Anschluss. Even those who admitted
its inevitability could not bring themselves to believe its possible
repercussions. Surely, it was urged, the Nuremberg Laws couldn’t be
enforced in Austria. The Jewish population was too well assimilated into
the mainstream of Austrian life: there were too many Jews in high
places, too many marriages between Jew and non-Jew, too many loyal
Austrian citizens who just happened to have Jewish forebears. How could
these laws be applied in a country in which the distinction between
Aryan and non-Aryan had become so blurred?</p>
<p>So, at least, it was reasoned by Hermine Wittgenstein. Writing her
memoirs, in 1945, she found it inconceivable that she could have been so
naïve – ‘but’, she adds, ‘cleverer people than I also regarded the
threatening political events with the same obtuseness’.3 No doubt in the
light of what was to follow, the Christmas of 1937 is remembered by her
in particularly rosy terms. She describes how delighted she was that all
four of her brothers and sisters, together with members of their own
families, were present (by this time she and Ludwig were the only
childless members of the family, while Helene was the head of a large
extended family of her own, the mother of four and the grandmother of
eight), and how they, together with pupils and ex-pupils from the school
at which she taught, sang carols, talked of old times, laughed and
joked, and, most ironically, gathered around the Christmas tree to sing
the Austrian national anthem. ’When, at midnight, the feast had to come
to an end, we were all of one mind that it had been the most lovely
Christmas ever, and we were already talking of the Christmas we would
have next year.’4</p>
<p>In Wittgenstein’s diary-notes of the time there is none of this
sentimental Gemütlichkeit. But neither is there any mention of political
events. It is impossible to believe, however, that he was as naïve about
the situation as his sister. Admittedly, his only source of information
during his stay in Norway was the Illustrated London News, which he had
sent to him by Fania Pascal; on the other hand, it should be remembered
that he had been in Cambridge twice during the last year, and there
would have had the inestimable benefit of Piero Sraffa’s informed
political analysis and judgement. His confession of his non-Aryan
origins in January was made, I believe, with awareness both of the terms
of the Nuremberg Laws and of the possibility of their future application
to Austrian citizens.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in his diary he does not discuss politics. He writes,
instead, of himself – of his mental and physical exhaustion after his
trying time in Norway, and of how difficult he finds it to converse with
the people he is with, how he can hardly speak to them, his mind is so
befogged, and of how unnecessary he feels himself to be there. He writes
also of Freud:</p>
<p>Freud’s idea: In madness the lock is not destroyed, only altered; the
old key can no longer unlock it, but it could be opened by a differently
constructed key.5</p>
<p>Perhaps here, too, he is writing about himself, and a feeling that if
only he could find a new key, he could unlock the doors to his own
prison, and then ‘everything will be different’.</p>
<p>In the first week of January he confined himself to bed, suffering
from gallbladder trouble, although scarcely believing that that was
really why he felt so tired and weak. In bed he reflected on his
sensuality and dwelt on his feelings for Francis. It was often the case,
he wrote, that when he was unwell he was open to sensual thoughts and
susceptible to sensual desires. He thought of Francis with sensual
desires, ‘and that is bad, but that’s what it’s like now’.6 He worried
that it had been so long since he had heard from Francis, and, as
always, was inclined to think the worst – to consider, for example, the
possibility that Francis had died: ‘Thought: it would be good and right
if he had died, and thereby taken my “folly” away.’7 This dark,
solipsistic, thought is immediately retracted, although only in part:
‘Although, there again, I only half mean that.’</p>
<p>This qualification is, if anything, still more shocking. After giving
the matter a second thought, was he really still even half-way inclined
to think that the death of Francis would be a good thing?</p>
<p>‘I am cold and wrapped up in myself’, he wrote, reflecting on the
fact that he did not feel himself to be in any loving relationship with
anyone in Vienna.8 He was inclined to think that the comfortable life at
the Alleegasse was bad for him, but where else was he to go? The
solitude of his house in Norway had proved unendurable, and he had no
wish to reenter academic life at Cambridge. Again, Dublin presented
itself as an attractive alternative. There he could be with Drury, and
perhaps even join Drury in training to be a psychiatrist. Everything was
in flux; he did not know what he would do any more than he knew where he
wanted to live. Of one thing, however, he was sure: that he needed to be
with someone with whom he could talk.fn1</p>
<p>Wittgenstein arrived in Dublin on 8 February, and moved into Drury’s
old flat in Chelmsford Road. On his second day there he described
himself as: ‘irreligious, ill-tempered, gloomy’. He was in the ‘hateful
situation’ of being incapable of work, of not knowing what he should do,
of having to simply vegetate and wait.9 He was, he said, still inclined
to lie: ‘Again and again I see that I cannot resolve to speak the truth
about myself. Or that I admit it to myself only for a moment and then
forget about it.’ His vanity, his cowardice, his fear of the truth,
prompted him to keep hidden things about himself that he did not want to
acknowledge: ‘until I am no longer clever enough to find them’. Two days
later he was beginning to regret that he had come to Dublin, where he
could apparently do nothing; ‘on the other hand I will have to wait,
because nothing is still very clear’.10 During these first few weeks in
Dublin he wrote very little philosophy; his philosophical thoughts had,
so to speak, been lulled to sleep: ’It is entirely as though my talent
lies in a kind of half-slumber.’11</p>
<p>While his philosophical thoughts slept, his ideas of becoming a
psychiatrist awoke. He asked Drury to arrange for him to visit St
Patrick’s Hospital so that he could meet patients who were seriously
mentally ill. This was, he told Drury, a matter of great interest to
him. After the visit he wrote (in English): ‘See the sane man in the
maniac! (and the mad man in yourself.)’, and for the next few weeks he
went two or three times a week to visit some of the long-stay patients.
He remained, however, uncertain as to what, if anything, it might lead
to.</p>
<p>Drury was at this time in his final year of training as a doctor, and
was spending his period of residence in the City of Dublin Hospital. He
told Wittgenstein that, when working in the casualty department, he was
disturbed by his clumsiness, and wondered whether he had made a mistake
in taking up medicine. Wittgenstein, whatever ambivalence he felt about
his own plans to take up medicine, was quick to quash Drury’s doubts.
The next day Drury received a letter from him which stated emphatically:
‘You didn’t make a mistake because there was nothing at the time you
knew or ought to have known that you overlooked.’12 He urged Drury:
‘Don’t think about yourself, but think about others’:</p>
<p>Look at people’s sufferings, physical and mental, you have them close
at hand, and this ought to be a good remedy for your troubles. Another
way is to take a rest whenever you ought to take one and collect
yourself. (Not with me because I wouldn’t rest you.)… Look at your
patients more closely as human beings in trouble and enjoy more the
opportunity you have to say ‘good night’ to so many people. This alone
is a gift from heaven which many people would envy you. And this sort of
thing ought to heal your frayed soul, I believe. It won’t rest it; but
when you are healthily tired you can just take a rest. I think in some
sense you don’t look at people’s faces closely enough.</p>
<p>The letter ends: ‘I wish you good thoughts but chiefly good
feelings.’</p>
<p>The first mention in Wittgenstein’s diary of the crisis facing
Austria during the early months of 1938 occurs on 16 February. ‘Can’t
work’, he then wrote:13</p>
<p>Think a great deal of a possible change of my nationality. Read in
today’s paper that a further compulsory rapprochement between Austria
and Germany has taken place – But I don’t know what I should really
do.</p>
<p>It was on that day that the Nazi leader of the ‘Nationalist
Opposition’, Dr Arthur Seyss-Inquart, was appointed the Austrian
Minister of the Interior, and the significance of the Berchtesgaden
meeting between Hitler and Schuschnigg became apparent to the world.</p>
<p>This meeting had been held on 12 February, and had initially been
celebrated in Austria as a sign of more cordial relations between the
two countries. It was only later realized that in this ‘friendly
discussion’ Hitler had demanded of Schuschnigg that Nazi ministers be
appointed in charge of the Austrian police, army and financial affairs,
and had threatened: ’You will either fulfill my demands in three days,
or I will order the march into Austria.’14 On 15 February The Times
reported:</p>
<p>If Herr Hitler’s suggestion that Dr von Seyss-Inquart should be made
Austrian Minister of the Interior with control of the Austrian police
were granted, it would in the general view of anti-Nazis in Austria mean
that before long the words ‘finis Austriae’ would be written across the
map of Europe.15</p>
<p>The following day the paper commented drily on the fact that,
immediately after taking his ministerial oath, Seyss-Inquart left Vienna
for Berlin: ’That the first act of the Minister of the Interior is to
pay a visit to a foreign country is a fair indication of the unusual
situation in which Austria finds itself after the Hitler-Schuschnigg
meeting.’16</p>
<p>During the following few weeks Wittgenstein kept a close watch on
developments. Every evening he asked Drury: ‘Any news?’, to which,
presumably, Drury responded by telling Wittgenstein what had been
reported that day. Reading Drury’s recollections, however, one wonders
which newspapers he read. His account of the days leading up to the
Anschluss is, to say the least, somewhat strange. He writes that on the
evening of 10 March he told Wittgenstein that all the papers reported
that Hitler was poised to invade Austria. Wittgenstein replied, with
quite breath-taking naïvety: ‘That is a ridiculous rumour. Hitler
doesn’t want Austria. Austria would be no use to him at all.’17 The next
evening, according to Drury, he had to tell him that Hitler had indeed
taken over Austria. He asked Wittgenstein if his sisters would be in any
danger. Again Wittgenstein replied with quite extraordinary insouciance:
‘They are too much respected, no one would dare to touch them.’</p>
<p>From this account one might think that Wittgenstein had forgotten
what he had read in the papers on 16 February – that he knew nothing
about the threat to Austria, that he was entirely ignorant about the
nature of the Nazi régime, and that he was unconcerned about the safety
of his family. All this is quite assuredly false, and one can only think
that he gave this misleading impression to Drury because he did not wish
to add to Drury’s burdens. That Drury was inclined to accept
Wittgenstein’s responses at face value perhaps says much about his
unquestioning attitude towards Wittgenstein, and about his own political
naïvety. It is also possible, I think, that Wittgenstein, who tended to
compartmentalize his friendships, did not think it worth discussing
these matters with Drury. With Drury he discussed religious questions;
it was Keynes, Sraffa and Pattisson upon whom he relied for discussion
of political and worldly affairs.</p>
<p>However, even on its own account – without, that is, bringing to it
anything else we might know or suspect about Wittgenstein’s awareness of
events – Drury’s story is a little puzzling. For if he told Wittgenstein
the news every evening, he would, for example, have told him on 9 March
about Schuschnigg’s announcement that he was to hold a plebiscite asking
the Austrian people to vote for or against an independent Austria. It
was this announcement that prompted Hitler, on the following day, to
move his forces up to the Austrian border in readiness for an invasion.
Now if Wittgenstein reacted to this latter piece of news by denying that
Hitler wanted Austria, what did he (or Drury for that matter) think was
the point of Schuschnigg’s plebiscite? Why should Austria’s independence
have needed reaffirming? Independence from whom?</p>
<p>Furthermore, the day after the troops had gathered on the border was
not the day on which Hitler took over Austria, but rather the day on
which Schuschnigg resigned and Seyss-Inquart became Chancellor. Hitler
and the German troops did not cross the border until the day after that,
12 March, when they were invited by the new Chancellor, and it was then
that the Anschluss was formally effected. This might be seen as a
quibble, but the events of these three days are etched clearly into the
minds of all who lived through them, and for Wittgenstein, if not for
Drury, the change in the state of affairs on each of these days would
have been of momentous importance. On 10 March Austria was an
independent state under Schuschnigg; on the 11th it was an independent
state under Nazi rule; and on the 12th it was part of Nazi Germany. To
an Austrian family of Jewish descent the difference between the second
and third days was decisive: it marked the difference between being an
Austrian citizen and a German Jew.</p>
<p>On the day of the Anschluss Wittgenstein wrote in his diary: ‘What I
hear about Austria disturbs me.18 Am unclear what I should do, whether
to go to Vienna or not. Think chiefly of Francis and that I do not want
to leave him.’ Despite his assurances to Drury, Wittgenstein was
extremely concerned about the safety of his family. His first reaction
was to go immediately to Vienna to be with them; what stopped him was
his fear that, if he did so, he would never see Francis again. He
nevertheless wrote to his family offering to come to Vienna if they
needed him.</p>
<p>The only letter that survives from the correspondence between
Wittgenstein and Sraffa is a long analysis of Wittgenstein’s position
following the Anschluss, which was written by Sraffa on 14 March, the
day of Hitler’s triumphant procession through Vienna. It demonstrates
clearly the calibre of informed political opinion and advice that was
open to Wittgenstein through Sraffa, and shows that Wittgenstein must
have written to him straight away for advice on the possible
consequences of his leaving for Vienna.</p>
<p>The letter begins:</p>
<p>Before trying to discuss, probably in a confused way, I want to give
a clear answer to your question.19 If, as you say, it is of ‘vital
importance’ for you to be able to leave Austria and return to England,
there is no doubt – you must not go to Vienna.</p>
<p>Sraffa pointed out that the Austrian frontier would be closed to the
exit of Austrians, and that, though these restrictions might soon be
lifted, there was every chance that, were he to go to Vienna,
Wittgenstein would not be allowed out for a long time. ‘You are aware no
doubt that now you are a German citizen’, Sraffa continued:</p>
<p>Your Austrian passport will certainly be withdrawn as soon as you
enter Austria: and then you will have to apply for a German passport,
which may be granted if and when the Gestapo is satisfied that you
deserve it…</p>
<p>As to the possibility of war, I do not know: it may happen at any
moment, or we may have one or two more years of ‘peace’. I really have
no idea. But I should not gamble on the likelihood of 6 months’
peace.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein must also have asked Sraffa whether it would help his
situation if he were to become a lecturer at Cambridge, for he goes
on:</p>
<p>If however you decided in spite of all to go back to Vienna, I think:
a) it would certainly increase your chance of being allowed out of
Austria if you were a lecturer in Cambridge; b) there would be no
difficulty in your entering England, once you are let out of Austria (of
Germany, I should say); c) before leaving Ireland or England you should
have your passport changed with a German one, at a German Consulate: I
suppose they will begin to do so in a very short time; and you are more
likely to get the exchange effected here than in Vienna; and, if you go
with a German passport, you are more likely (though not at all certain)
to be let out again.</p>
<p>‘You must be careful’, Sraffa warned, ‘about various things’:</p>
<p>1)if you go to Austria, you must have made up your mind not to say
that you are of Jewish descent, or they are sure to refuse you a
passport;</p>
<p>2)you must not say that you have money in England, for when you are
there they could compel you to hand it over to the Reichsbank;</p>
<p>3)if you are approached, in Dublin or Cambridge, by the German
Consulate, for registration, or change of passport, be careful how you
answer, for a rash word might prevent your ever going back to
Vienna;</p>
<p>4)take great care how you write home, stick to purely personal
affairs, for letters are certainly censored.</p>
<p>With regard to the question of a change of nationality, Sraffa
advised that, if Wittgenstein had made up his mind to apply for Irish
citizenship, then he should do so before his Austrian passport was taken
away from him, for it would be easier as an Austrian than as a German.
On the other hand:</p>
<p>In the present circumstances I should not have qualms about British
nationality if that is the only one which you can acquire without
waiting for another ten years’ residence: also you have friends in
England who could help you to get it: and certainly a Cambridge job
would enable you to get it quickly.</p>
<p>Sraffa, who was leaving for Italy the following Friday, invited
Wittgenstein to come to Cambridge to discuss the matter if he could make
it before then, but warned: ‘afterwards letters will be forwarded to me
in Italy, so take care what you say, that you may be writing to the
Italian censor’. He ends: ‘Excuse this confused letter’, forcing one to
wonder what levels of clarity and precision he reached in the rest of
his correspondence.</p>
<p>‘You are aware no doubt that now you are a German citizen.’ On the
day that Sraffa wrote these dreaded words, Wittgenstein’s diary shows
him to be wrestling with precisely this awareness:</p>
<p>I am now in an extraordinarily difficult situation. Through the
incorporation of Austria into the German Reich I have become a German
citizen.20 That is for me a frightful circumstance, for I am now subject
to a power that I do not in any sense recognise.</p>
<p>Two days later, he was, ‘in my head and with my mouth’, decided upon
the loss of his Austrian nationality and resigned to the thought of
emigrating for several years: ‘it can’t be any different.21 But the
thought of leaving my people alone is dreadful.’</p>
<p>Upon receiving Sraffa’s letter Wittgenstein immediately left Dublin
for Cambridge to discuss the situation with him. On 18 March he reported
in his diary:</p>
<p>Sraffa advised me yesterday that I should, for the time being, not go
to Vienna under any circumstances, for I could not now help my people
and in all probability would not be allowed to leave Austria.22 I am not
fully clear what I should do, but, for the time being, I think Sraffa is
right.</p>
<p>Following this conversation with Sraffa, Wittgenstein decided upon a
course of action. First, he would secure an academic job at Cambridge,
and then apply for British citizenship. In connection with both aims he
immediately wrote to Keynes for help. He began by explaining to Keynes
the situation – that by the annexation of Austria he had become a German
citizen, and, by the Nuremberg Laws, a German Jew: ‘The same, of course,
applies to my brother and sisters (not to their children, they count as
Aryans).’23 ‘I must say’, he added, ‘that the idea of becoming (or
being) a German citizen, even apart from all the nasty consequences, is
APPALLING to me. (This may be foolish, but it just is so.)’ He outlined
Sraffa’s arguments against his going to Vienna – that his Austrian
passport would be taken away from him, that, as a Jew, he would not be
issued with a new passport, and that, therefore, he would be unable to
leave Austria or ever again get a job. Presented with the choice of
being a German Jew or a British university lecturer, he was forced, with
some reluctance, to choose the latter:</p>
<p>The thought of acquiring British citizenship had occurred to me
before; but I have always rejected it on the ground: that I do not wish
to become a sham-english-man (I think you will understand what I mean).
The situation has however entirely changed for me now. For now I have to
choose between two new nationalities, one of which deprives me of
everything, while the other, at least, would allow me to work in a
country in which I have spent on and off the greater part of my adult
life, have made my greatest friends and have done my best work.</p>
<p>… As to getting a job at Cambridge you may remember that I was an
‘assistant faculty lecturer’ for 5 years … Now it is for this that I
shall apply, for there is no other job vacant. I had, in fact, thought
of doing so anyway; though not now, but perhaps next autumn. But it
would be important now for me to get a job as quickly as possible; for
a) it would help me in becoming naturalised and b) if I failed in this
and had to become a ‘German’ I would have more chance to be allowed out
of Austria again on visiting my people if I had a JOB in England.</p>
<p>On Sraffa’s advice Wittgenstein asked Keynes for an introduction to a
solicitor – ‘one who is an expert in this kind of thing’ – to help with
his application for naturalization. ‘I want to add that I’m in no sort
of financial difficulties. I shall have about 300 or 400 £ and can
therefore easily hold out for another year or so.’</p>
<p>Keynes’s reply to this letter has not survived, but it is clear that
he did what he could to secure Wittgenstein a place at the university,
and to help him in his application for British citizenship.
Wittgenstein, however, was typically anxious that Keynes might have
misunderstood his situation, and sent Keynes’s letter to Pattisson,
asking him to ‘smell’ it. Above all, he was concerned that Keynes might
present him to the university authorities and to the Home Office as a
member of that most wretched of species, the impoverished refugee. He
was therefore suspicious of Keynes’s suggestion that he might be
eligible for a grant from the Academic Assistance Council. This, he told
Pattisson, ‘is a body who helps people, say refugees, who have no money,
andandandand accepting there [sic] assistance would not only not be
quite fair of me but also place me in an entirely wrong category’.24 So
nervous was he on this point that he was inclined to doubt whether he
should use Keynes’s introduction to a solicitor:</p>
<p>I have a vague fear that this introduction, if slightly wrongly
worded, might make things more awkward for me; it may, for instance,
represent me as a refugee of sorts andandandand stress a wrong aspect of
the business.</p>
<p>His anxieties proved to be unfounded. The university responded
quickly, and he was given a lecturing post starting from the beginning
of the following term.</p>
<p>Of great concern to Wittgenstein throughout the long wait for his
British passport was the situation of his family. It was difficult for
him to know how much danger they were in, and he was not reassured when,
soon after the Anschluss, he received this note (written in
English):</p>
<p>My dear Ludwig,25</p>
<p>Not a day passes but that Mining and I talk about you; our loving
thoughts are always with you. Please do not worry about us, we are quite
well really and in best spirits and ever so happy to be here. To see you
again will be our greatest joy.</p>
<p>Lovingly yours,</p>
<p>Helene</p>
<p>In his diary Wittgenstein dismissed this (no doubt correctly) as:
‘reassuring sounding news from Vienna.26 Obviously written for the
censor.’</p>
<p>In fact, both Helene and Hermine were slow to appreciate the danger
they were in, and when realization finally came they panicked. Hermine
recalls how, one morning soon after the Anschluss, Paul announced, with
terror in his voice: ‘We count as Jews!’ Hermine could understand why
this should strike such fear into Paul’s heart.27 His career as a
concert pianist mattered a great deal to him, and as a Jew he would not
be allowed to perform; besides, he liked to go for long walks in the
country, and all those signs proclaiming ‘ Juden verboten’ must make his
walks a good deal less pleasant. But for herself, the fact that she
counted as a Jew under German law seemed to mean very little. She spent
most of her life inside her own four walls, and apart from the fact that
a few people who used to greet her in public might no longer do so, her
life would surely go on much the same.</p>
<p>At first Paul tried to get reassurances that the family would be
treated as Aryans, on the grounds that they had always been loyal and
patriotic citizens, and had accomplished much for their country. To this
end he and Gretl (who, as an American citizen, was in no personal
danger) travelled to Berlin to negotiate with the Nazi authorities.
Their appeal came to nothing. Unless they could produce evidence of a
second Aryan grandparent, they were told, they would remain Jews.</p>
<p>Another branch of the family, the descendants of Wittgenstein’s Aunt
Milly, made efforts to establish the Aryan credentials of Hermann
Christian Wittgenstein. In the Berlin archives a report survives written
by Brigitte Zwiauer, Milly’s granddaughter, pleading Hermann Christian’s
case. It is addressed to the Reichstelle für Sippenforschung
(‘Department for Genealogical Research’, the Nazi ministry responsible
for determining who was and who was not Aryan), and states that Hermann
Christian is known in the family to be the illegitimate son of a member
of the princely family of Waldeck. Zwiauer admits that there is no
direct proof of this, but stresses that there is also no proof to the
contrary; that, although Hermann Christian was brought up in the Jewish
community, there is no evidence that he was actually the son of a Jew.
As indirect proof of his Aryan origins, she encloses a photograph of the
eleven children of Hermann and Fanny. ‘That these children descend from
two fully Jewish parents’, she argues, ‘appears to us biologically
impossible.’28 The report points out that Hermann chose the middle name
‘Christian’ for himself, and was known as an anti-Semite who, in adult
life, avoided association with the Jewish community and did not allow
his offspring to marry Jews. The report is dated 29 September 1938, but
its plea was ignored until nearly a year later, when the Nazis saw some
advantage to themselves in accepting it.</p>
<p>Hermine, Gretl and Helene would have nothing to do with this report.
As far as they were concerned, Hermann Christian was the son of Moses
Maier, and if that meant that, under German law, they were regarded as
Jews, then so be it. Paul would probably have gone along with whatever
steps were necessary to escape the consequences of being a Jew in the
German Reich. As it was, he saw no hope of being reclassified and
therefore sought only to leave Greater Germany as soon as he could. He
urged Hermine and Helene to do the same – to leave everything behind and
go to Switzerland. When a house is burning down, he argued, the sensible
thing to do is to jump out of the window and forget about one’s
possessions inside. Hermine, however, could not bring herself to leave
her friends, her family and her beloved Hochreit, and neither could
Helene face leaving her children and grandchildren. Both refused to go.
In July 1938, after many harsh words had been exchanged, Paul left his
sisters in Austria and went to Switzerland alone.</p>
<p>Helene and Hermine left Vienna to spend the summer at the Hochreit,
still convinced that their status as Jews would not place them in any
danger. They were shaken out of this conviction by Gretl, who in
September came to the Hochreit and told them that outside Germany it was
widely believed by those who were well informed that war would break out
at any moment (this being the time of the Czechoslovakia crisis), and
that it was also known that the Jews in Germany would be rounded up and
placed in concentration camps, where they would be insufficiently fed
and treated very badly. Gretl urged Hermine and Helene to leave
Austria.</p>
<p>By this time, however, it was no longer possible for German Jews to
enter Switzerland, and some other plan had to be devised. Upon Gretl’s
suggestion, Hermine agreed to buy Yugoslav passports for herself and
Helene from a Jewish lawyer in Vienna. She apparently believed that this
was the way in which the Yugoslav government conferred nationality, for
she says she had no idea that what they were buying were false passports
until Arvid Sjögren, who travelled to Yugoslavia on their behalf to
collect them, reported that they had been produced in a workshop
specializing in forged documents.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hermine went ahead with the plan and travelled to
Munich herself to obtain visas for Switzerland using the false
passports. Soon afterwards, the police began to investigate this
particular source of forgeries, and before they could begin their flight
to Switzerland Hermine and Helene were arrested, together with Gretl and
Arvid. They each spent two nights in prison, except Gretl, who was
detained a further night. At the subsequent trial Gretl did everything
she could to present herself as solely responsible for the whole fiasco,
a claim that was accepted by the magistrate, although according to
Hermine their best defence was their appearance and their manner of
speech. Appearing before the court was not a collection of the grubby,
smelly, kaftan-wearing Jews described in Mein Kampf, but proud members
of a famous and wealthy high-bourgeois Austrian family. All four were
cleared of the charges brought against them.</p>
<p>How much Wittgenstein himself knew of this story is impossible to
say. Enough, anyway, for him to be sick with worry about his sisters’
situation. In a letter to Moore of October 1938 he speaks of ‘the great
nervous strain of the last month or two’, and attributes it to the fact
that: ‘My people in Vienna are in great trouble.’29 The wait for his
British passport became almost unendurable, as he longed to be able to
use it to travel to Vienna to do whatever he could to help his sisters.
In the midst of all this anxiety, the sight of Neville Chamberlain
returning from Munich proclaiming ‘Peace in our time’ was too much to
bear. He sent Gilbert Pattisson one of the postcards printed to
celebrate Chamberlain’s ‘success’. Beneath a picture of Chamberlain and
his wife the legend reads: ‘The Pilgrim of Peace. Bravo! Mr
Chamberlain.’ On the back Wittgenstein wrote: ’In case you want an
Emetic, there it is.’30</p>
<p>In the winter of 1938–9 the Reichsbank began to make enquiries about
the huge amounts of foreign currency held by the Wittgenstein family.
Under Nazi law the Reichsbank was empowered to compel the family to hand
this money over to them. Owing to the complicated arrangement under
which the wealth was held, however, it was difficult for them to get
their hands on it. This circumstance suggested to Gretl another
possibility of securing the safety of her sisters: they would agree to
hand over the foreign currency in return for a written declaration that
Hermine and Helene would be treated as Aryans.</p>
<p>So began a long series of negotiations between the authorities in
Berlin and the Wittgensteins, which culminated in the Nazis agreeing to
accept the report prepared by Brigitte Zwiauer the previous year in
return for the transfer of the Wittgensteins’ foreign currency. The
negotiations were complicated by the disagreement between Paul and the
rest of the family. Paul, who by this time had left Switzerland and was
living in America, was against doing a deal with the Nazis in order to
satisfy his sisters’ perverse desire to stay in Austria. It would be
wrong, he argued, to help the Nazis by placing in their hands such a
large fortune. (Hermine attributes this latter argument to Paul’s
advisors, who, she points out, were, without exception, Jews – as though
only a Jew would think such a consideration relevant.)</p>
<p>These wrangles continued throughout the spring of 1939, with Gretl
travelling between New York, Berlin and Vienna, trying to come to an
agreement that suited all parties, and the matter was still unsettled
when Wittgenstein finally received his British passport on 2 June 1939.
Barely a month later, he used it to travel to Berlin, Vienna and New
York, with the aim of helping Gretl to reach a settlement. It was not,
as Hermine says, the sort of thing to which her brother was suited,
either by experience or by temperament. Furthermore (though she does not
point this out), the irony of bribing the Nazis to accept a lie about
the very thing to which he had confessed just two years previously can
hardly have escaped him. He nevertheless entered into the negotiations
with all the considerable precision and tenacity at his disposal. ‘And
if’, Hermine adds, ’he did not achieve in New York what he had had in
mind, then the blame was really not his.’31 It was, she implies
elsewhere, Paul’s.</p>
<p>Despite Paul’s objections, the result of these negotiations was that
a great deal of the family wealth was transferred from Switzerland to
the Reichsbank, and the Reichstelle für Sippenforschung issued a formal
declaration to its Viennese office that Hermann Christian Wittgenstein
was, without qualification, deutschblütig. Consequently, in August 1939,
Hermine and Helene, and all the other grandchildren of Hermann
Christian, received certificates stating that they were Mischlinge (of
mixed Jewish blood) rather than Jews.32 Later, in February 1940, the
Berlin authorities went further, and issued a proclamation that the
regulations covering Mischlinge were not applicable to the descendants
of Hermann Christian Wittgenstein, and that ‘their racial classification
under the Reich Citizenship Law [the Nuremberg Laws] presents no further
difficulties’.33 Hermine and Helene were thus able to survive the war
relatively untroubled.</p>
<p>fn1 The fact that Wittgenstein chose to be with Drury rather than
Francis demands explanation. Unfortunately, however, we are forced to
speculate on the point; in his diary he does not even consider the idea
that he should go to Cambridge to be with Francis. Perhaps it was not
Francis, but Cambridge, that he was avoiding, or perhaps he was
attracted to Dublin by the possibility that there he might train as a
doctor. But in the light of the remarks already quoted there must also
be a possibility that his desire for Francis, and Francis’s almost
overwhelming desire for him, made Cambridge unattractive – that he
considered the sensuality between himself and Francis incompatible with
the change he wished to see in himself.</p>
