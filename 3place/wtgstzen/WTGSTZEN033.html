<p>3 RUSSELL’S PROTÉGÉ</p>
<p>1 There exists some disagreement about whether Wittgenstein met Frege
or Russell first. The account I give here agrees with that of Brian
McGuinness in Wittgenstein: A Life, and follows that given by Hermine
Wittgenstein in her memoir, ‘My Brother Ludwig’, Recollections,
pp. 1–11. It is also supported by G. H. von Wright, who recounts in his
‘Biographical Sketch’ the story told to him by Wittgenstein that he went
first to see Frege in Jena and then (on Frege’s advice) to Cambridge to
see Russell. Russell, however, was of the opinion that Wittgenstein had
not met Frege before he came to Cambridge, and this opinion is shared by
some of Wittgenstein’s friends, including Elizabeth Anscombe and Rush
Rhees (who expresses it in his editorial notes to Hermine’s
recollections). Professor Anscombe has suggested to me that, as Hermine
Wittgenstein was an elderly woman by the time she wrote her
reminiscences, her memory might have been at fault. However, in the
absence of any conclusive reason for thinking this, I have trusted
Hermine’s account.</p>

aufkommen können, scheint mir so gut wie gewiss. Die Engländer – die
beste Rasse der Welt – können nicht verlieren. Wir aber können verlieren

<p>79 ‘Right at the beginning’: ‘Gleich zu Anfang treffe ich die
Ausdrücke “der Fall sein” und “Tatsache” und ich vermute, dass der Fall
sein und eine Tatsache sein dasselbe ist. Die Welt ist alles, was der
Fall ist und die Welt ist die Gesamtheit der Tatsachen. Ist nicht jede
Tatsache der Fall und ist nicht, was der Fall ist, eine Tatsache? Ist
nicht dasselbe, wenn ich sage, A sei eine Tatsache wie wenn ich sage, A
sei der Fall? Wozu dieser doppelte Ausdruck? … Nun kommt aber noch ein
dritter Ausdruck: “Was der Fall ist, die Tatsache, ist das Bestehen von
Sachverhalten”. Ich verstehe das so, dass jede Tatsache das Bestehen
eines Sachverhaltes ist, so dass eine andre Tatsache das Bestehen eines
andern Sachverhaltes ist. Könnte man nun nicht die Worte “das Bestehen”
streichen und sagen: “Jede Tatsache ist ein Sachverhalt, jede andre
Tatsache ist ein anderer Sachverhalt. Könnte man vielleicht auch sagen
“Jeder Sachverhalt ist das Bestehen einer Tatsache”? Sie sehen: ich
verfange mich gleich anfangs in Zweifel über das, was Sie sagen wollen,
und komme so nicht recht vorwärts’: GF to LW, 28.6.19.</p>

Hiermit erklären Sie nicht den Ausdruck “Sachverhalt”, sondern den
ganzen Ausdruck, “das Bestehen eines Sachverhaltes” … Die Freude beim
Lesen Ihres Buches kann also nicht mehr durch den schon bekannten
Inhalt, sondern nur durch die Form erregt werden, in der sich etwa die
Eigenart des Verfassers ausprägt. Dadurch wird das Buch eher eine
künstlerische als eine wissenschaftliche Leistung; das, was darin gesagt

sind von dieser Art. Der Einwand fasst die Sache nicht an ihrer Wurzel,
wo das Leben ist, sondern schon so weit aussen wo sich nichts mehr
rectifizieren lässt, selbst wenn es falsch ist. Ein guter Einwand hilft
unmittelbar zur Lösung, ein flacher muss erst überwunden werden und kann
dann von weiter unten herauf (wie eine überwundene abgestorbene Stelle)

<p>46 ‘A strange dream’: ’Ein seltsamer Traum:</p>
<p>Ich sehe in einer Illustrierten Zeitschrift eine Photographie von
Evighztg (Vertsagt), der ein viel besprochener Tagesheld ist. Das Bild
stellt ihn in seinem Auto dar. Es ist von seinen Schandtaten die Rede;
Hänsel steht bei mir und noch jemand anderer ähnlich meinem Bruder Kurt.
Dieser sagt, dass Vertsag ein Jude sei aber die Erziehung eines reichen
schottischen Lords genossen habe. Jetzt ist er Arbeiterführer. Seinen
Namen habe er nicht geändert weil das dort nicht Sitte sei. Es ist mir
neu dass Vertsagt den ich mit der Betonung auf der ersten Silbe
ausspreche, ein Jude ist, und ich erkenne dass ja sein Name einfach
verzagt heisst. Es fällt mir nicht auf, dass es mit “ts” geschrieben ist
was ich ein wenig fetter als das übrige gedruckt sehe. Ich denke: muss
denn hinter jeder Unanständigkeit ein Jude stecken. Nun bin ich und
Hänsel auf der Terrasse eines Hauses etwa des grossen Blockhauses auf
der Hochreit und auf der Strasse kommt in seinem Automobil Vertsag; er
hat ein böses Gesicht ein wenig rötlich blondes Haar und einen solchen
Schnauzbart (er sieht nicht jüdisch aus). Er feuert nach rückwärts mit
einem Maschinengewehr auf einen Radfahrer, der hinter ihm fährt und sich
vor Schmerzen krümmt und der unbarmherzig durch viele Schüsse zu Boden
geschossen wird. Vertsag ist vorbei und nun kommt ein junges Mädchen
ärmlich aussehend auf einem Rade daher und auch sie empfängt die Schüsse
von dem weiterfahrenden Vertsag. Und diese Schüsse die ihre Brust
treffen machen ein brodelndes Geräusch wie ein Kessel in dem sehr wenig
Wasser ist über einer Flamme. Ich hatte Mitleid mit dem Mädchen und
dachte nur in Österreich kann es geschehen dass dieses Mädchen kein
hilfreiches Mitleid findet und die Leute zusehen wie sie leidet und
umgebracht wird. Ich selbst fürchte mich auch davor ihr zu helfen weil
ich die Schüsse Vertsags fürchte. Ich nähere mich ihr, suche aber
Deckung hinter einer Planke. Dann erwache ich. Ich muss nachtragen, dass
in dem Gespräch ob Hänsel erst in Anwesenheit des anderen dann nachdem
er uns verlassen hat ich mich geniere und nicht sagen will dass ich ja
selbst von Juden abstamme oder dass der Fall Vertsags ja auch mein Fall
ist. Nach dem Erwachen komme ich darauf dass ja verzagt nicht mit “ts”
geschrieben wird, glaube aber sonderbarerweise dass es mit
“pf”geschrieben wird “pferzagt”. Ich habe den Traum gleich nach dem
Erwachen notiert. Die Gegend die in dem Traum etwa der Gegend hinter der
Hochreiter Kapelle entspricht (die Seite gegen den Windhut) stelle ich
mir im Traum als einen steilen bewaldeten Abhang und eine Strasse im Tal
vor wie ich es in einem anderen Traum gesehen habe. Ähnlich einem Stück
der Strasse von Gloggnitz nach Schlagl. Als ich das arme Mädchen
bedauere sehe ich undeutlich ein altes Weib, welches sie bedauert aber
sie nicht zu sich nimmt und ihr hilft. Das Blockhaus auf der Hochreit
ist auch nicht deutlich, wohl aber die Strasse und was auf ihr vorgeht.
Ich glaube ich hatte eine Idee dass der Name wie ich ihn im Traume
ausspreche “Vért-sagt” ungarisch ist. Der Name hatte für mich etwas
böses, boshaftes, und sehr männliches’: MS 107, p. 219, 1.12.29.</p>

sich selbst kann man in dem verschiedensten Geiste schreiben. Im

wahrhaften Autobiographien die man schreiben könnte, alle Stufen vom
Höchsten zum Niedrigsten. Ich zum Beispiel kann meine Biographie nicht
höher schreiben als ich bin. Und durch die blosse Tatsache, dass ich sie
schreibe, hebe ich mich nicht notwendigerweise, ich kann mich dadurch
sogar schmutziger machen als ich schon war. Etwas in mir spricht dafür,
meine Biographie zu schreiben und zwar möchte (m)ich mein Leben einmal
klar ausbreiten, um es klar vor mir zu haben und auch für andere. Nicht
so sehr, um darüber Gericht zu halten, als um jedenfalls Klarheit und
Wahrheit zu schaffen’: MS 108, pp. 46–7, 28.12.29.</p>

Grund ausfindig machen würde, auf sie stolz zu sein, oder c) die Sache
so darstellen, als sei diese seine Natur eine nebensächliche
Angelegenheit. Im ersten Falle lügt er, im zweiten ahmt er eine nur dem
Naturadel natürliche Eigenschaft, den Stolz, nach, der ein vitium
splendidum ist, das er ebensowenig wirklich besitzen kann, wie ein
krüppelhafter Körper natürliche Gracie. Im dritten Fall macht er
gleichsam die sozialdemokratische Geste, die die Bildung über die rohen
Eigenschaften des Körpers stellt, aber auch das ist ein Betrug. Er ist
was er ist und das ist zugleich wichtig und bedeutsam, aber kein Grund
zum Stolz, andererseits immer Gegenstand der Selbstachtung. Ja ich kann
den Adelsstolz des Andern und siene Verachtung meiner Natur anerkennen,
denn ich erkenne : ja dadurch nur meine Natur an und den andern der zur
Umgebung meiner Natur, die Welt, deren Mittelpunkt dieser vielleicht
hässliche Gegenstand, meine Person, ist’: MS 110. pp. 252–3, 1.7.31.</p>

<p>31 ‘vain, thoughtless, frightened‘: ‘Eitel, gedankenlos, ängstlich …
Ich möchte jetzt bei jemandem wohnen. In der Früh ein menschliches
Gesicht sehen. Anderseits bin ich jetzt wieder so verweichlicht, dass es
vielleicht gut wäre allein sein zu müssen. Bin jetzt ausserordentlich
verächtlich … Ich habe das Gefühl, dass ich jetzt nicht ganz ohne Ideen
wäre, aber dass mich die Einsamkeit bedrücken wird, dass ich nicht
arbeiten werde können. Ich fürchte mich, dass in meinem Haus alle meine
Gedanken werden getötet werden. Dass dort ein Geist der
Niedergeschlagenheit von mir ganz Besitz ergreifen wird’: MS 118,

unrecht und ich kann es gar nicht. Vielleicht aber könnte ich es auch –
ich könnte morgen packen und den nächsten Tag abfahren. Aber möchte ich
es? Wäre es richtig? Ist es nicht richtig, hier noch auszuhalten?
Gewiss. Ich würde mit einem schlechten Gefühl morgen abfahren. “Halt es
aus”, sagt mir eine Stimme. Es ist aber auch Eitelkeit dabei, dass ich
aushalten will; und auch etwas Besseres. – Der einzige triftige Grund
hier früher oder gleich abzureisen wäre, dass ich anderswo jetzt
vielleicht besser arbeiten könnte. Denn es ist Tatsache, dass der Druck,
der jetzt auf mir liegt, mir das Arbeiten beinahe unmöglich macht und

schreiben, wenn ich nicht die letzten 2 Wochen mit B. verbracht hätte.
Und ich hätte sie nicht so verbringen können, wenn Krankheit oder irgend
ein Unfall dazwischen gekommen wäre’: MS 132, 8.10.46.</p>
<p>43 ‘In love’: ‘Ich bin in der Liebe zu wenig gläubig und zu wenig
mutig … ich bin leicht verletzt und fürchte mich davor, verletzt zu
werden, und sich in dieser Weise selbst schonen ist der Tod aller Liebe.
Zur wirklichen Liebe braucht es Mut. Das heisst aber doch, man muss auch
den Mut haben, abzubrechen, und zu entsagen, also den Mut eine
Todeswunde zu ertragen. Ich aber kann nur hoffen, dass mir das
Fürchterlichste erspart bleibt’: MS 132, 22.10.46.</p>
<p>44 ‘I do not have the courage’: ‘Ich habe nicht den Mut und nicht die
Kraft und Klarheit den Tatsachen meines Lebens gerade in’s Gesicht zu
schauen. – B. hat zu mir eine Vor-Liebe. Etwas, was nicht halten kann.
Wie diese verwelken wird, weiss ich natürlich nicht. Wie etwas von ihr
zu erhalten wäre, lebendig, nicht gepresst in einem Buch als Andenken,
weiss ich auch nicht … Ich weiss nicht, ob und wie ich es aushalten
werde, dies Verhältnis mit dieser Aussicht weiterzunähren … Wenn ich mir
vorstelle, dass ich es abgebrochen hätte, so fürchte ich mich vor der
Einsamkeit’: MS 133, 25.10.46.</p>
<p>45 ‘love is a joy’: ‘Die Liebe ist ein Glück. Vielleicht ein Glück
mit Schmerzen, aber ein Glück … In der Liebe muss ich sicher ruhen
können. – Aber kannst du ein warmes Herz zurückweisen; Ist es ein Herz,
das warm für mich schlägt; – I’ll rather do anything than to hurt the
soul of friendship. – I must know: he won’t hurt our friendship. Der
Mensch kann aus seiner Haut nicht heraus. Ich kann nicht eine Forderung,
die tief in mir, meinem ganzen Leben verankert, liegt, aufgeben. Denn
die Liebe ist mit der Natur verbunden; und würde ich unnatürlich, so
würde //müsste// die Liebe aufhören. – Kann ich sagen: “Ich werde
vernünftig sein, und das nicht mehr verlangen.”? … Ich kann sagen: Lass
ihn gewähren, – es wird einmal anders werden. – Die Liebe, die ist die
Perle von grossem Wert, die man am Herzen hält, für die man nichts
eintauschen will, die man als das wertvollste schätzt. Sie zeigt einem
überhaupt – wenn man sie hat – was grosser Wert ist. Man lernt, was es
heisst: ein Edelmetall von allen andern aussondern … Das Furchtbare ist
die Ungewissheit … “Auf Gott vertrauen” … Von da, wo ich bin, zum
Gottvertrauen ist ein weiter Weg. Freudevolle Hoffnung und Furcht sind
einander verschwistert. Ich kann die eine nicht haben ohne dass sie an
die andre grenzt’: MS 133, 26.10.46.</p>
<p>46 ‘Trust in God’: ibid.</p>
<p>47 ‘Ask yourself these questions: ‘Frag dich diese Frage: Wenn du
stirbst, wer wird dir nachtrauern; und wie tief wird die Trauer sein?
Wer trauert um F.; wie tief trauere ich um ihn, der mehr Grund zur
Trauer hat als irgend jemand? Hat er nicht verdient, dass jemand sein
ganzes Leben lang um ihn trauert? Wenn jemand so er. Da möchte man
sagen: Gott wird ihn aufheben und ihm geben, was ein schlechter Mensch
ihm versagt’: MS 133, 10.11.46.</p>

<p>50 ‘Can you not cheer up’: ‘Kannst du nicht auch ohne seine Liebe
fröhlich sein? Musst du ohne diese Liebe in Gram versinken? Kannst du
ohne diese Stütze nicht leben? Denn das ist die Frage: kannst du nicht
aufrecht gehn, ohne dich auf diesen Stab zu lehnen? Oder kannst du dich
nur nicht entschliessen ihn aufzugeben? Oder ist es beides? – Du darfst
nicht immer Briefe erwarten, die nicht kommen … Es ist nicht Liebe, was
mich zu dieser Stütze zieht, sondern, dass ich auf meinen zwei Beinen
allein nicht sicher stehen kann’: MS 133, 27.11.46.</p>
<p>51 ‘Some men’: ‘Mancher Mensch ist im ganzen Leben krank und kennt

philosophische Probleme zu lösen, wenn ich mit der Hauptsache nicht ins
Reine kommen kann?’: MS 134, 13.4.47.</p>
<p>56 ‘My lectures are going well’: ‘Meine Vorlesungen gehen gut, sie
werden nie besser gehen. Aber welche Wirkung lassen sie zurück? Helfe
ich irgendjemand? Gewiss nicht mehr, als wenn ich ein grosser
Schauspieler wäre, der ihnen Tragödien vorspielt. Was sie lernen, ist
nicht wert gelernt zu werden; und der persönliche Eindruck nützt ihnen
nichts. Das gilt für Alle, mit vielleicht einer, oder zwei Ausnahmen’:
