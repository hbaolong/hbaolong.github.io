<h4 id="manchester">2 MANCHESTER</h4>
<p>SUPPRESSING HIS GROWING preoccupation with philosophical questions,
Wittgenstein, in the spring of 1908, at the age of nineteen, went to
Manchester to pursue research in aeronautics. It was his apparent
intention to construct, and eventually to fly, an aeroplane of his own
design.</p>
<p>These were the very pioneering days of aeronautics, when the subject
was in the hands of rival groups of amateurs, enthusiasts and eccentrics
from America and the various European nations. Orville and Wilbur Wright
had not yet amazed the world by staying in the air for a full two and a
half hours. Though no substantial successes had been made, and the
subject was treated with some amusement and derision by the Press and
public, scientists and governments alike were aware of the potential
importance of the research. It was a field in which successful
innovation could expect handsome rewards, and Wittgenstein’s project no
doubt had the complete support of his father.</p>
<p>He began his research by experimenting on the design and construction
of kites. For this purpose he went to work at the Kite Flying Upper
Atmosphere Station, a meteorological observation centre near Glossop,
where observations were made using box-kites carrying various
instruments. The centre had been set up by the recently retired
Professor of Physics Arthur Schuster, who continued to maintain an
active interest in its work. The head of the centre was J. E. Petavel,
lecturer in meteorology at Manchester, who developed a keen interest in
aeronautics and later became one of the leading authorities on the
subject.</p>
<p>While working at the observatory Wittgenstein lived at the Grouse
Inn, an isolated roadside pub on the Derbyshire Moors. From here, on 17
May, he wrote to Hermine, describing the conditions under which he
worked, exulting in the glorious isolation of the Grouse Inn, but
complaining of the incessant rain and the rustic standards of the food
and the toilet facilities: ’I’m having a few problems growing accustomed
to it all; but I am already beginning to enjoy it.’1</p>
<p>His job, he said, ‘is the most delightful I could wish for’:</p>
<p>I have to provide the observatory with kites – which formerly were
always ordered from outside – and to ascertain through trial and error
their best design; the materials for this are ordered for me by request
from the observatory. To begin with, of course, I had to help with the
observations, in order to get to know the demands which would be made of
such a kite. The day before yesterday, however, I was told that I can
now begin making independent experiments … Yesterday I began to build my
first kite and hope to finish it by the middle of next week.</p>
<p>He goes on to describe his physical and emotional isolation, and his
deep need for a close companion. At the inn he was the only guest apart
from ‘a certain Mr Rimmer who makes meteorological observations’, and at
the observatory the only time he had company was on Saturdays, when
Petavel arrived with some of his students:</p>
<p>Because I am so cut off I naturally have an extraordinarily strong
desire for a friend and when the students arrive on Saturday I always
think it will be one of them.2</p>
<p>He was too reticent to approach the students, but shortly after this
letter a friend came to him. William Eccles, an engineer four years
older than himself, came to the observatory to conduct meteorological
research. On his arrival at the Grouse Inn, Eccles walked into the
common living room to find Wittgenstein surrounded with books and papers
which lay scattered over the table and floor. As it was impossible to
move without disturbing them, he immediately set to and tidied them up –
much to Wittgenstein’s amusement and appreciation. The two quickly
became close friends, and remained so, with interruptions, until the
Second World War.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1908 Wittgenstein registered as a research student
in the Engineering Department of Manchester University. In those days
Manchester had very few research students, and the arrangements made for
them were somewhat casual. No formal course of study was organized, nor
was a supervisor provided to oversee the research. It was not expected
that Wittgenstein should work for a degree. Instead, it was understood
that he would pursue his own line of research, having at his disposal
the laboratory facilities of the university and the interested
attention, should he require it, of its professors.</p>
<p>Among these professors was the mathematician Horace Lamb, who held a
seminar for research students to which they could bring their problems
for his consideration. Wittgenstein seems to have availed himself of
this provision. In a letter to Hermine of October he describes a
conversation he had had with Lamb, who, he says:</p>
<p>… will try to solve the equations that I came up with and which I
showed him.3 He said he didn’t know for certain whether they are
altogether solvable with today’s methods and so I am eagerly awaiting
the outcome of his attempts.</p>
<p>His interest in the solution of this problem was evidently not
confined to its aeronautical applications. He began to develop an
interest in pure mathematics, and to attend J. E. Littlewood’s lectures
on the theory of mathematical analysis, and one evening a week he met
with two other research students to discuss questions in mathematics.
These discussions led to a consideration of the problems of providing
mathematics with logical foundations, and Wittgenstein was introduced by
one of his fellow students to Bertrand Russell’s book on the subject,
The Principles of Mathematics, which had been published five years
previously.</p>
<p>Reading Russell’s book was to prove a decisive event in
Wittgenstein’s life. Though he continued for another two years with
research in aeronautics, he became increasingly obsessed with the
problems discussed by Russell, and his engineering work was pursued with
an ever-growing disenchantment. He had found a subject in which he could
become as absorbed as his brother Hans had been in playing the piano, a
subject in which he could hope to make, not just a worthwhile
contribution, but a great one.</p>
<p>The central theme of The Principles of Mathematics is that, contrary
to the opinion of Kant and most other philosophers, the whole of pure
mathematics could be derived from a small number of fundamental,
logical, principles. Mathematics and logic, in other words, were one and
the same. It was Russell’s intention to provide a strictly mathematical
demonstration of this by actually making all the derivations required to
prove each theorem of mathematical analysis from a few trivial,
self-evident axioms. This was to be his second volume. In fact, it grew
into the monumental three-volume work Principia Mathematica. In this,
his ‘first volume’, he lays the philosophical foundations of this bold
enterprise, taking issue principally with Kant’s at that time widely
influential view that mathematics was quite distinct from logic and was
founded on the ‘structure of appearance’, our basic ‘intuitions’ of
space and time. For Russell, the importance of the issue lay in the
difference between regarding mathematics as a body of certain,
objective, knowledge, and regarding it as a fundamentally subjective
construction of the human mind.</p>
<p>Russell did not become aware until The Principles of Mathematics was
being printed that he had been anticipated in the main lines of his
enterprise by the German mathematician Gottlob Frege, who in his
Grundgesetze der Arithmetik (the first volume of which was published in
1893) had attempted precisely the task that Russell had set himself. He
made a hurried study of Frege’s work and appended to his book an essay
on ‘The Logical and Arithmetical Doctrines of Frege’, praising the
Grundgesetze.</p>
<p>Until then, the Grundgesetze had been a much neglected work. Few had
bothered to read it, and even fewer had understood it. Russell was
perhaps the first to appreciate its importance. In his quick study of
Frege’s work, however, he had noticed a difficulty that Frege had
overlooked. The problem it raised seemed at first a minor one, but its
solution was soon to become the cardinal problem in the foundations of
mathematics.</p>
<p>To provide a logical definition of number, Frege had made use of the
notion of a class, which he defined as the extension of a concept. Thus,
to the concept ‘man’ corresponds the class of men, to the concept
‘table’, the class of tables, and so on. It was an axiom of his system
that to every meaningful concept there corresponds an object, a class,
that is its extension. Russell discovered that, by a certain chain of
reasoning, this led to a contradiction. For on this assumption there
will be some classes that belong to themselves, and some that do not:
the class of all classes is itself a class, and therefore belongs to
itself; the class of men is not itself a man, and therefore does not. On
this basis we form ‘the class of all classes which do not belong to
themselves’. Now we ask: is this class a member of itself or not? The
answer either that it is or that it is not leads to a contradiction.
And, clearly, if a contradiction can be derived from Frege’s axioms, his
system of logic is an inadequate foundation upon which to build the
whole of mathematics.</p>
<p>Before publishing his discovery, Russell wrote to Frege at the
University of Jena to inform him of it. Frege was then preparing the
second volume of his Grundgesetze, and though he included in it a hasty
and unsatisfactory reaction to the paradox, he realized it showed his
entire system to be fundamentally flawed. Russell himself proposed to
avoid the contradiction by a strategy he called the ‘Theory of Types’,
an outline of which formed the second appendix to the Principles. This
postulates a hierarchy of types of objects, collections of which can
legitimately be grouped together to form sets: thus, the first type is
individuals, the second, classes of individuals, the third, classes of
classes of individuals, and so on. Sets must be collections of objects
of the same type; thus, there is no such thing as a set which is a
member of itself.</p>
<p>The Theory of Types does indeed avoid the contradiction, but at the
expense of introducing into the system a somewhat ad hoc measure. It may
be true that there are different types of things; it may also be true
that there is no such thing as a set which is a member of itself – but
these are hardly the sort of trivial, self-evident truths of logic from
which Russell had originally intended to proceed. Russell himself was
dissatisfied with it, and his book ends with a challenge:</p>
<p>What the complete solution of the difficulty may be, I have not
succeeded in discovering; but as it affects the very foundations of
reasoning, I earnestly commend the study of it to the attention of all
students of logic.4</p>
<p>It was precisely the bait needed to hook Wittgenstein, and, as
Russell recommends, he dedicated himself earnestly to the solution of
the paradox. He devoted much of his first two terms at Manchester to a
close study of both Russell’s Principles and Frege’s Grundgesetze, and,
some time before April 1909, formulated his first attempt at a solution,
which he sent to Russell’s friend, the mathematician and historian of
mathematics Philip E. B. Jourdain.</p>
<p>That Wittgenstein sent his solution to Jourdain rather than to
Russell or Frege perhaps indicates some degree of tentativeness. He
presumably came across Jourdain’s name in a 1905 issue of the
Philosophical Magazine, which contains an article by Jourdain on the
foundations of mathematics and an article by his professor at
Manchester, Horace Lamb. An entry in Jourdain’s correspondence book,
dated 20 April, shows that he replied to Wittgenstein’s attempted
solution after first discussing it with Russell. Neither, it seems, were
inclined to accept it:</p>
<p>Russell said that the views I gave in reply to Wittgenstein (who had
‘solved’ Russell’s contradiction) agree with his own.5</p>
<p>According to his sister Hermine, Wittgenstein’s obsession with the
philosophy of mathematics at this time caused him to suffer terribly
from the feeling of being torn between conflicting vocations. It may
have been Jourdain’s dismissal of his ‘solution’ that persuaded him, for
the time being, to stick to aeronautics. Not for another two years did
he return to the fray, when he finally contacted both Frege and Russell
directly to present to them a more considered philosophical position.
Though he had taste enough for philosophical problems, he was yet to be
persuaded he had talent for them.</p>
<p>Though still convinced he had neither talent nor taste for
aeronautical engineering, Wittgenstein persevered with his attempts to
design and construct an aircraft engine. Plans of his proposed engine
survive, and show that his idea was to rotate the propeller by means of
high-speed gases rushing from a combustion chamber (rather in the way
that the pressure of water from a hose is used to turn a rotating lawn
sprinkler). The idea was fundamentally flawed, and quite impractical for
propelling an aeroplane. It was, however, successfully adopted during
the Second World War in the design of certain helicopters.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein had a combustion chamber built specially for him by a
local firm, and much of his research consisted of experimenting on this
with various discharge nozzles. He was helped by a laboratory assistant
called Jim Bamber, whom he later described as: ‘one of the very few
people with whom I got on well during my Manchester period’.6 His
general irritability at having to dedicate himself to engineering work
was compounded by the fiddly nature of the task, and, recalls Bamber,
‘his nervous temperament made him the last person to tackle such
research’:7</p>
<p>… for when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw
his arms about, stamp around and swear volubly in German.</p>
<p>According to Bamber, Wittgenstein would ignore the midday meal break
and carry on until the evening, when he would relax either by sitting in
a very hot bath (‘He used to brag about the temperature of the water’8)
or by going to a concert given by the Hallé Orchestra, occasionally
accompanied by Bamber, who has described how ‘he used to sit through the
concert without speaking a word, completely absorbed’.9</p>
<p>Other diversions included outings with Eccles, who by this time had
left the university to take up an engineering job in Manchester. One
Sunday afternoon remained in Eccles’s memory. Wittgenstein had decided
he would like to go to the seaside, to Blackpool. On finding that there
was no suitable train, he did not seek an alternative but suggested they
hire a special train, just for the two of them. He was eventually
dissuaded from this by Eccles, and induced to adopt the less expensive
(though still, to Eccles’s mind, extravagant) option of taking a taxi to
Liverpool, where they had a trip on the Mersey ferry.</p>
<p>During his second year at Manchester, Wittgenstein abandoned his
attempt to design and construct a jet engine and concentrated instead on
the design of the propeller. His work on this was taken sufficiently
seriously by the university for him to be elected to a research
studentship for what was to be his last year there, 1910–11. He himself
was confident enough about the importance and originality of his work to
patent his design. His application, together with a provisional
specification of his design for ‘Improvements in Propellers applicable
for Aerial Machines’, is dated 22 November 1910. On 21 June 1911 he left
a complete specification, and the patent was accepted on 17 August of
that year.</p>
<p>By this time, however, Wittgenstein’s obsession with philosophical
problems had got the better of his resolve to pursue a vocation in
engineering. Though his studentship was renewed for the following year,
and he is still listed as a student of Manchester University in October
1911, his days as an aeronaut were finished during the summer vacation
of that year, when, 10‘in a constant, indescribable, almost pathological
state of agitation’, he drew up a plan for a proposed book on
philosophy.</p>
