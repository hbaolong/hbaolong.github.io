<h4 id="a-citizen-of-no-community">26 A CITIZEN OF NO COMMUNITY</h4>
<p>THE LAST TWO years of Wittgenstein’s life have about them something
of the nature of an epilogue. The task of arranging his work for
publication, though not complete, was now over – at least for him. He
had by now accepted that his book – the work that had been the centre of
his life for nearly twenty years – would not appear in his lifetime. The
job of editing it and seeing to its posthumous publication was in the
hands of others. And in other ways, too, he was dependent on other
people in a way that he had not been since before the First World War.
He had no income, no home of his own, and little taste for the
solitariness and fierce independence that before he had craved. His last
two years were spent living as a guest of his friends and disciples –
with Malcolm in Ithaca, von Wright in Cambridge, and Elizabeth Anscombe
in Oxford.</p>
<p>But his motives for living with others were not primarily financial.
Indeed, there was actually no financial need for him to do so: as he had
earlier told Malcolm, he had enough money saved from his salary at
Cambridge to last another two years. The need to live with others was
partly emotional, partly physical (he was increasingly ill and in need
of attention), and also partly intellectual. So long as he lived, he
wanted to live as a philosopher, and though he now felt, for the most
part, unable to live alone and write, he did feel able to discuss
philosophy. Thus we find, to a much greater extent than hitherto, the
stimulus for his philosophical thinking being provided by the thoughts
and problems of others. The work he wrote in his last two years, though
naturally in many ways of a piece with the Investigations, is in another
respect quite distinct from it; it is much more directed to the solution
of other people’s problems. It has the character that he himself had
earlier attributed to all his work – that of clarifying the work of
others – and it is written much more consciously than his other work
with a view to being useful. It is as though he wished to reward the
hospitality of his hosts by availing them of his most prized possession:
his philosophical talent.</p>
<p>In his exchange of letters with Malcolm before he left for the
States, Wittgenstein returned again and again to the question of
whether, in coming to Ithaca, he would be of any use to Malcolm
philosophically. ‘My mind is tired andandandand stale’, he wrote in
April.1 ‘I think I could discuss philosophy if I had someone here to
discuss with, but alone I can’t concentrate on it.’ Two months later he
wrote: ‘I know you’d extend your hospitality to me even if I were
completely dull andandandand stupid, but I wouldn’t want to be a mere
dead weight in your house.2 I want to feel that I can at least give a
little for so much kindness.’</p>
<p>He set sail on 21 July 1949, travelling on the Queen Mary across the
Atlantic. ‘My anaemia is as good as cured’, he wrote before he left,
insisting that it was unnecessary for Malcolm to meet him from the boat:
‘Maybe, like in the films, I’ll find a beautiful girl whom I meet on the
boat andandandand who will help me.’3 Malcolm was, nevertheless, there
to meet him, and was surprised to find him apparently fit and strong,
‘striding down the ramp with a pack on his back, a heavy suitcase in one
hand, cane in the other’.</p>
<p>In some respects, at least, the Malcolms found him an undemanding
guest. He insisted on eating bread and cheese at all meals, declaring
that he did not care what he ate so long as it was always the same.</p>
<p>The Malcolms lived on the edge of the settled area around Ithaca,
just outside the boundaries of the Cayuga Heights, and Wittgenstein
often took long walks in the nearby countryside. He took a great
interest in the unfamiliar flora of the area. Stuart Brown, a colleague
of Malcolm’s at Cornell University, remembers that, on one occasion at
least, this unfamiliarity resulted in astonished disbelief:</p>
<p>Ordinarily, he would refuse the offer of a ride.4 But one afternoon,
after it had begun to rain, I stopped to offer him a ride back to the
Malcolms. He accepted gratefully, and once in the car asked me to
identify for him the seed pods of a plant which he picked. ‘Milkweed’, I
told him and pointed out the white sap for which the weed is named. He
then asked me to describe the flowers of the plant. I failed so
miserably that I at length stopped the car by a grown up field, walked
out and picked him more plants, some with flowers and some with seeds.
He looked in awe from flowers to seed pods and from seed pods to
flowers. Suddenly he crumpled them up, threw them down on the floor of
the car, and trampled them. ‘Impossible!’ he said.</p>
<p>Brown was one of a group of philosophers at Cornell with whom
Wittgenstein held discussions. The others included Max Black, Willis
Doney, John Nelson and Oets Bouwsma. ‘I’m doing my old work here’ was
how he put it in a letter to Roy Fouracre.fn1 He had, he said, often
thought of Fouracre – ‘particularly because I often thought I might take
up my old work at Guy’s or some such place, andandandand now I’m such an
old cripple that I couldn’t possibly do the work I used to in the
dispensary lab’.5 To Malcolm, too, he expressed an anxiety about what he
was to do with the remainder of his life: ‘When a person has only one
thing in the world – namely a certain talent – what is he to do when he
begins to lose that talent?’</p>
<p>In the meantime, there was plenty of demand and appreciation at
Cornell for that talent. Together with Malcolm he attended a
surprisingly large number of seminars and discussions. There were
regular meetings with Brown, Bouwsma and Black, in which they discussed
a variety of philosophical topics, seminars with Doney to read the
Tractatus, and meetings with Bouwsma to discuss Frege’s ‘On Sense and
Reference’. He also met with Nelson and Doney to discuss a problem about
memory, an occasion remembered by Nelson as ‘probably the most
philosophically strenuous two hours I have ever spent’:6</p>
<p>Under the relentless probing and pushing of his enquiry my head felt
almost as if it were ready to burst … There was no quarter given – no
sliding off the topic when it became difficult. I was absolutely
exhausted when we concluded the discussion.</p>
<p>Nelson’s reactions were typical. Though the topics of these meetings
were usually suggested by others, the discussions were invariably
dominated by Wittgenstein, who demanded from the participants a degree
of absorption and attentive rigour to which they were unaccustomed.
After one such discussion, Bouwsma asked Wittgenstein whether such
evenings robbed him of his sleep. He said that they did not. ‘But then’,
recalls Bouwsma:7</p>
<p>… he added in all seriousness and with the kind of smile Dostoyevsky
would suggest in such a circumstance: ‘No but do you know, I think I may
go nuts’.</p>
<p>Apart from Malcolm, Bouwsma was the person with whom Wittgenstein
spent most time. He seemed to see in him the quality of seriousness that
he considered essential in a discussion partner. Unlike the others,
Bouwsma was the same age as Wittgenstein. He had been Malcolm’s tutor at
the University of Nebraska, and Malcolm was one of several students whom
Bouwsma had encouraged to go to Cambridge to study with G. E. Moore.
Bouwsma himself had been deeply influenced by Moore’s work, having
abandoned his earlier Hegelianism under the impact of Moore’s
refutations of idealism. Later, through another of his students, Alice
Ambrose, he came across Wittgenstein’s Blue Book, and made a close study
of it.</p>
<p>After a few meetings at Malcolm’s house in the company of others,
Wittgenstein arranged to meet Bouwsma alone. It was then that the
conversation quoted above took place. Wittgenstein had come to see
Bouwsma primarily to ask him whether he thought their discussion had
been ‘any good’ – did Bouwsma get anything out of it? ‘I am a very vain
person’, he told him.8 ‘The talk wasn’t good. Intellectually, it may
have been, but that isn’t the point … My vanity, my vanity’. He
discussed with Bouwsma his reasons for resigning his position at
Cambridge:</p>
<p>First I wanted to finish my book … Second, why should I teach? What
good is it for X to listen to me? Only the man who thinks gets any good
out of it.</p>
<p>He made an exception of a few students, ‘who had a certain obsession
and were serious’. But most of them came to him because he was clever,
‘and I am clever, but it’s not important’.</p>
<p>What was important was that his teaching should have a good effect,
and in this respect the students with whom he was most satisfied were
those who had not become professional philosophers – Drury, for example,
and Smythies, and those that had become mathematicians. Within
professional philosophy he thought his teaching had done more harm than
good. He compared it to Freud’s teachings, which, like wine, had made
people drunk. They did not know how to use the teaching soberly. ‘Do you
understand?’ he asked. ‘Oh yes’, Bouwsma replied. ‘They had found a
formula.’ ‘Exactly.’</p>
<p>That evening Bouwsma took Wittgenstein in his car up to the top of
the hill overlooking the town. The moon was up. ‘If I had planned it’,
said Wittgenstein, ‘I should never have made the sun at all’:9</p>
<p>See! How beautiful! The sun is too bright and too hot … And if there
were only the moon there would be no reading and writing.</p>
<p>In addition to the other meetings mentioned, Wittgenstein had a
number of private discussions with Malcolm. These are of special
interest, because they provided the primary stimulus for the work which
Wittgenstein produced in the last eighteen months of his life.</p>
<p>He had taken with him to Ithaca copies of both parts of Philosophical
Investigations, so that he and Malcolm could read it through together.
He told Malcolm that, though the book was not in a completely finished
state, he did not now think that he could give the final polish to it in
his lifetime. And, although he did not want to take it to a publisher in
its unfinished state, he did want his friends to read and understand it.
He therefore considered having it mimeographed and distributed among his
friends with expressions of dissatisfaction, like: ‘This is not quite
right’ or: ‘This is fishy’, written in parentheses after remarks that
needed revision. Malcolm did not like the plan, and advised Wittgenstein
against it; mimeograph copies, he thought, were an unfitting form of
publication for a work of such importance.</p>
<p>A more time-consuming alternative would have been for Wittgenstein to
go through the book paragraph by paragraph with each of his friends
separately. This he seems to have made some attempt to do. Soon after
arriving at Ithaca, he suggested that he and Malcolm should read through
the book in this way – just as they had begun to do in Cambridge in
1946. Again, however, Malcolm found the procedure too confining, and
after a few meetings the project was once more abandoned. Instead, they
began a series of discussions on a philosophical issue that had more
immediate relevance to Malcolm’s own work.</p>
<p>The topic of these discussions was Moore’s attempt to refute
philosophical scepticism in his articles ‘Proof of an External World’
and ‘A Defence of Common Sense’. Scepticism asserts that nothing about
the external world can be known with certainty, not even that it is
external. Moore’s ‘Proof of an External World’ begins with an attempt to
prove that some external objects at least can be shown with certainty to
exist, his famous example being the existence of his own hands:</p>
<p>I can prove now, for instance, that two human hands exist.10 How? By
holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a certain gesture with
the right hand, ‘Here is one hand’, and adding, as I make a certain
gesture with the left, ‘and here is another’.</p>
<p>In ‘A Defence of Common Sense’ Moore provides a list of common-sense
beliefs, all of which he claims to know with certainty to be true. These
include: that a body exists which is Moore’s body; that this body has
been, throughout its existence, not far from the surface of the earth;
that the earth had existed for many years before Moore was born;
etc.</p>
<p>Not long before Wittgenstein’s visit Malcolm had published an article
criticizing Moore for incorrectly using the verb ‘to know’ in these
claims to knowledge. Holding up a hand and saying: ‘I know that this is
a hand’, or pointing to a tree and saying: ‘I know for certain that this
is a tree’ is, Malcolm maintained, a senseless use of ‘know’. Moore had
written a spirited defence of his use of ‘know’ in a letter to Malcolm,
and now Malcolm had the opportunity of finding out Wittgenstein’s view
of the matter; he was determined not to waste it.</p>
<p>In conversation with Malcolm, Wittgenstein insisted that: ‘An
expression has meaning only in the stream of life.’ So whether or not
Moore’s statements were senseless depends on whether we can imagine an
occasion on which they could sensibly be used: ‘To understand a sentence
is to be prepared for one of its uses.11 If we can’t think of any use
for it at all, then we don’t understand it at all’. In this way:</p>
<p>Instead of saying that Moore’s statement ‘I know that this is a tree’
is a misuse of language, it is better to say that it has no clear
meaning, and that Moore himself doesn’t know how he is using it … It
isn’t even clear to him that he is not giving it an ordinary
usage.12</p>
<p>We could, Wittgenstein thought, imagine ordinary uses for some of
Moore’s statements more easily than for others: ‘It isn’t difficult to
think of usages for “I know that this is a hand”; it is more difficult
for “I know that the earth has existed for many years”.’</p>
<p>Moore, of course, was not using his statements in an ‘ordinary’ way;
he was using them to make a philosophical point. He was not informing
his readers that he had two hands; he was attempting to refute
philosophical scepticism. On this point Wittgenstein was quite clear
that Moore had failed:</p>
<p>When the sceptical philosophers say ‘You don’t know’ and Moore
replies ‘I do know’, his reply is quite useless, unless it is to assure
them that he, Moore, doesn’t feel any doubt whatever.13 But that is not
what is at issue.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s own view of scepticism remained that succinctly
expressed in the Tractatus: ‘Scepticism is not irrefutable, but
obviously nonsensical, when it tries to raise doubts where no questions
can be asked.’14 And it is in connection with this view of scepticism
that he found something philosophically interesting about Moore’s
‘common-sense propositions’. They do not give examples of ‘certain
knowledge’, but, rather, examples of cases in which doubt is
nonsensical. If we could seriously doubt that Moore was holding up two
hands, there would be no reason not to doubt anything else, including
the trustworthiness of our senses. And in that case the whole framework
in which we raise doubts and answer them would collapse: ‘Certain
propositions belong to my “frame of reference”.15 If I had to give them
up, I shouldn’t be able to judge anything.’ One such proposition might
be the statement: ‘That’s a tree’, said while standing in front of a
tree:</p>
<p>If I walked over to the tree and could touch nothing I might lose
confidence in everything my senses told me … Moore said ‘I know that
there’s a tree’, partly because of the feeling that if it turned out not
to be a tree, he would have to ‘give up’.16</p>
<p>The idea that there are certain judgements (among them, some of
Moore’s statements of common sense) that belong to our frame of
reference, and as such cannot sensibly be doubted, was developed by
Wittgenstein in the work written during the eighteen months left of his
life following his visit to the United States.fn2</p>
<p>At the beginning of the autumn term Malcolm took Wittgenstein along
to a meeting of the graduate students of philosophy at Cornell
University. His presence there, as John Nelson has recalled, had a
tremendous impact. ‘Just before the meeting was to get underway’, Nelson
writes, ‘Malcolm appeared approaching down the corridor’:17</p>
<p>On his arm leaned a slight, older man, dressed in windjacket and old
army trousers. If it had not been for his face, alight with
intelligence, one might have taken him for some vagabond Malcolm had
found along the road and decided to bring out of the cold.</p>
<p>… I leaned over to Gass and whispered, ‘That’s Wittgenstein’. Gass
thought I was making a joke and said something like, ‘Stop pulling my
leg’. And then Malcolm and Wittgenstein entered. [Gregory] Vlastos was
introduced and gave his paper and finished. Black, who was conducting
this particular meeting, stood up and turned to his right and it became
clear, to everyone’s surprise … that he was about to address the shabby
older man Malcolm had brought to the meeting. Then came the startling
words; said Black, ‘I wonder if you would be so kind, Professor
Wittgenstein …’ Well, when Black said ‘Wittgenstein’ a loud and
instantaneous gasp went up from the assembled students. You must
remember: ‘Wittgenstein’ was a mysterious and awesome name in the
philosophical world of 1949, at Cornell in particular. The gasp that
went up was just the gasp that would have gone up if Black had said ‘I
wonder if you would be so kind, Plato …’</p>
<p>Soon after this meeting Wittgenstein fell ill and was admitted to
hospital for an examination. He had already booked his return passage to
England in October, and was extremely frightened that he would have to
remain in the United States as a result of the operation. He feared
that, like Mining, he would be found to have cancer, and would be
bed-ridden for the rest of his life. On the day before he went into
hospital he said to Malcolm in a frenzy:</p>
<p>I don’t want to die in America.18 I am a European – I want to die in
Europe … What a fool I was to come.</p>
<p>The examination, however, did not find anything seriously wrong with
him, and he recovered sufficiently well over the next two weeks to
return to England as planned, arriving in London at the end of October.
His original plan was to spend a few days in Cambridge with von Wright
and then return to Ross’s Hotel in Dublin. Soon after arriving in
London, however, he fell ill once more, and it was not until 9 November
that he was able to go to Cambridge, still too ill to contemplate the
journey to Dublin.</p>
<p>Drury had once told Wittgenstein that if he ever needed to see a
doctor when in Cambridge he should consult Dr Edward Bevan. Drury had
got to know Bevan during the war, when they had been in the same unit in
the army, and had been impressed by his ability. By a coincidence, Bevan
was also von Wright’s family doctor. Soon after his arrival at
Cambridge, therefore, Wittgenstein was examined by Dr Bevan. The final
diagnosis was given on 25 November: cancer of the prostate.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein was in no way shocked to learn that he had cancer. He
was, however, shocked to hear that something could be done about it.
Cancer of the prostate often responds well to hormone therapy, and
Wittgenstein was therefore immediately prescribed oestrogen. He was told
that, with the help of this hormone, he could reasonably hope to live
for another six years. ‘I am sorry that my life should be prolonged in
this way’, he wrote to Rhees: ’six months of this half-life would be
plenty.’19</p>
<p>A few days after he learnt that he had cancer he wrote to Helene,
asking if it would be convenient for him to come to Vienna to stay in
the family home in the Alleegasse. ‘My health is very bad’, he told her,
‘and I can therefore do no work.20 In Vienna I hope to find peace … If I
could have my old room in the Alleegasse (with the overhead light), that
would be good.’</p>
<p>Having warned her that she would find him in bad health, and that he
would have to spend part of each day in bed, he told her nothing more
about the nature of his illness. He was determined that his family
should not know that he had cancer. Before he left for Vienna he wrote
to Malcolm imploring him not to let anyone know about his illness: ’This
is of the greatest importance for me as I plan to go to Vienna for
Christmas andandandand not to let my family know about the real
disease.’21</p>
<p>He flew to Vienna on 24 December, and moved into his old room at the
Alleegasse. With Hermine lying in bed dying of cancer, and with
Wittgenstein himself having the unmistakable pallor of a man stricken
with the same disease, it is unlikely that his family did not guess the
real nature of his illness. Wittgenstein, however, continued with his
attempts at concealment, sending a telegram to von Wright with the
euphemistic message: ’ARRIVED VIENNA EXCELLENT HEALTH AND SPIRITS.
NOTIFY FRIENDS.’22</p>
<p>For the first month that he was there, Wittgenstein did no writing at
all. He allowed himself the luxury of leading the kind of comfortable
life for which the family home was so admirably equipped. At the
Alleegasse he was well fed and well looked after, and even entertained.
‘I haven’t been to a concert so far’, he wrote to von Wright:23</p>
<p>but I hear a fair amount of music. A friend of mine [Rudolf Koder]
plays the piano to me (very beautifully) and one of my sisters and he
play piano duets. The other day they played two string quartets by
Schumann and a sonata written for 4 hands by Mozart.</p>
<p>‘I’m very happy andandandand being treated very well’, he wrote to Dr
Bevan.24 Bevan had written to him about Ben, and had obviously commented
on Ben’s timidity. ‘He isn’t so much timid’, Wittgenstein explained, ‘as
very shy andandandand very repressed, particularly before he knows
someone well’:</p>
<p>I wish I knew how important it really is that he should get a job at
Barts. He seems to regard it as important. But I wish he could get out
of London! I have an idea Barts isn’t good for him. I don’t mean by this
that he is in any danger of becoming superficial, or snobbish, or
anything like that. There is no danger there. But I wish he could be
with more simple andandandand more kindly people with whom he could open
up, or he will get more andandandand more withdrawn.</p>
<p>To his doctor, Wittgenstein was prepared to dwell a little on the
state of his health. It was, as one would expect (especially in an
Austrian winter – ‘we had – 15 C’, he told Bevan), rather
precarious:</p>
<p>I had a rather nasty cold lately, accompanied by stomach troubles;
I’m afraid I was on the verge of seeing a doctor andandandand very
worried about that, but it cleared up by itself andandandand I’m almost
as good as new again.</p>
<p>Of course, he could only really feel ‘as good as new’ in so far as he
was capable of philosophizing. ‘Colours spur us to philosophize. Perhaps
that explains Goethe’s passion for the theory of colours’, he had
written in 1948, and in January 1950 it was exactly with the intention
of spurring himself to philosophize that he began reading Goethe’s
Farbenlehre (‘Theory of Colour’).25 ‘It’s partly boring and repelling,
but in some ways also very instructive and philosophically interesting’,
he told von Wright.26 Its chief merit, as he put it to Malcolm, was that
it ‘stimulates me to think’.</p>
<p>Eventually, it also stimulated him to write. A short series of twenty
remarks inspired by reading Goethe’s Farbenlehre have survived,
presumably written during what was to be Wittgenstein’s last visit to
Vienna. They are now published as Part II of On Colour.</p>
<p>In them Wittgenstein connects Goethe’s Theory of Colour, as he had
earlier connected Goethe’s other scientific work, with his own
philosophical investigations. Contrary to Goethe himself, who regarded
his theory as a successful refutation of Newton’s Theory of Optics,
Wittgenstein was clear that whatever interest the theory had, it was not
as a contribution to physics. It was, rather, a conceptual
investigation. From Wittgenstein’s point of view this made it more, not
less, interesting:</p>
<p>I may find scientific questions interesting, but they never really
grip me.27 Only conceptual and aesthetic questions do that. At bottom I
am indifferent to the solution of scientific problems; but not of the
other sort.</p>
<p>To be sure, Goethe’s studies, like scientific investigations, were
based on careful observations, but these observations do not enable us
to construct explanatory laws. They do, however, enable us to clarify
certain concepts. Take, for example, the proposition: ‘Blending in white
removes the colouredness from the colour; but blending in yellow does
not.’ What kind of proposition is this?</p>
<p>As I mean it, it can’t be a proposition of physics.28 Here the
temptation to believe in a phenomenology, something midway between
science and logic, is very great.</p>
<p>It can’t be a proposition of physics, because its contrary is not
false but meaningless: ‘If someone didn’t find it to be this way, it
wouldn’t be that he had experienced the contrary, but rather that we
wouldn’t understand him’.29 Therefore, to analyse this proposition (and
others like it) is not to clarify a matter of fact, whether physical or
phenomenological; it is to clarify certain concepts (‘colour’,
‘colouredness’, ‘white’ etc.). Thus:</p>
<p>Phenomenological analysis (as e.g. Goethe would have it) is analysis
of concepts and can neither agree with nor contradict physics.30</p>
<p>On 11 February Hermine died. ‘We had expected her end hourly for the
last 3 days’, Wittgenstein wrote to von Wright the next day.31 ‘It
wasn’t a shock.’</p>
<p>His own health, meanwhile, continued to improve, and he was able to
meet with Elizabeth Anscombe (who was in Vienna to improve her German in
preparation for translating Wittgenstein’s work) two or three times a
week. Anscombe acted as a further stimulus to his attempts to recover
his ability for philosophical work. At a meeting of the Austrian College
Society in Alpbach, she had met Paul Feyerabend, who was then a student
at the University of Vienna. She gave Feyerabend manuscripts of
Wittgenstein’s work and discussed them with him. Feyerabend was then a
member of the Kraft Circle, an informal philosophy club founded by
students at the university who were dissatisfied with the official
course of lectures. It was exactly the kind of informal gathering at
which Wittgenstein felt able to discuss philosophy publicly, and
eventually he was persuaded to attend. Feyerabend recalls:</p>
<p>Wittgenstein who took a long time to make up his mind and then
appeared over an hour late gave a spirited performance and seemed to
prefer our disrespectful attitude to the fawning admiration he
encountered elsewhere32</p>
<p>This meeting of the Kraft Circle is probably the only public meeting
of philosophers that Wittgenstein attended while he was in Vienna. His
regular meetings with Anscombe, however, probably helped to ‘spur him to
philosophize’. As well as the twenty remarks on Goethe’s theory of
colour, there is also a series of sixty-five remarks which continue the
topic of his conversations with Malcolm. These have now been published
as the first sixty-five remarks of On Certainty. In them Wittgenstein
insists that, like ‘Moore’s Paradox’, Moore’s ‘Defence of Common Sense’
is a contribution to logic. For: ‘everything descriptive of a
language-game is part of logic’.33</p>
<p>The line of thought here is strikingly reminiscent of the Tractatus
(as Wittgenstein himself later acknowledges: On Certainty, see here).
The idea is that, if the contrary of a proposition makes sense, then
that proposition can be regarded as an empirical hypothesis, its truth
or falsity being dependent on the way things stand in the world. But if
the contrary of a proposition does not make sense, then the proposition
is not descriptive of the world but of our conceptual framework; it is
then a part of logic.</p>
<p>Thus: ‘Physical objects exist’ is not an empirical proposition, for
its contrary is not false but incomprehensible. Similarly, if Moore
holds up two hands and our reaction is to say: ‘Moore’s hands don’t
exist’, our statement could not be regarded as false but as
unintelligible. But if this is so, then these ‘framework propositions’
do not describe a body of knowledge; they describe the way in which we
understand the world. In this case, it makes no sense to claim, as Moore
does, that you know them with certainty to be true:</p>
<p>If ‘I know etc’, is conceived as a grammatical proposition, of course
the ‘I’ cannot be important.34 And it properly means ‘There is no such
thing as a doubt in this case’ or ‘The expression “I do not know” makes
no sense in this case.’ And of course it follows from this that ‘I know’
makes no sense either.</p>
<p>There is an important parallel between these remarks on Moore and the
remarks on Goethe. In both cases Wittgenstein’s concern is to point out
that what look like experiential propositions should actually be seen as
grammatical propositions, descriptive not of our experience but of the
framework within which our experience can be described. In some ways his
discussion of both is an application of a general truth enunciated in
the Investigations:</p>
<p>If language is to be a means of communication there must be agreement
not only in definitions but also (queer as this may sound)in
judgments.35 This seems to abolish logic but does not do so.</p>
<p>Such statements as: ‘Blending in white removes the colouredness from
the colour’ and: ‘The earth has existed for a long time’ are examples of
such judgements. Recognizing them as such does not abolish logic, but it
does considerably expand and complicate it, in such a way as to include
within its domain discussions, for example, of Goethe’s Theory of Colour
and of Moore’s ‘Defence of Common Sense’.</p>
<p>The work written in Vienna is no more than the beginning of these
discussions. Compared to the work written in Dublin the previous year,
it is dull stuff. It has none of the aphoristic compression of that
work, nor does it contain any of the kind of startlingly imaginative
metaphors that characterize Wittgenstein’s best work. It does show,
however, that, as Wittgenstein’s health gradually recovered, so too did
his capacity for philosophical writing.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein left Vienna on 23 March and returned to London, where he
stayed for a week at the home of Rush Rhees’s wife, Jean, in Goldhurst
Terrace. Being back in England was, he wrote, ‘woeful’. The order of the
place was ‘loathsome’.36 The people seemed dead; every spark of life was
extinguished.</p>
<p>On 4 April he moved back to von Wright’s house in Cambridge, where he
found waiting for him an invitation from Oxford University to deliver
the John Locke lectures for 1950. These are an annual series of
prestigious and relatively well-paid lectures which are traditionally
delivered by a distinguished visiting philosopher. Despite the financial
rewards (he was offered £200 to give them), he was not tempted. He was
told that there would be a large audience of over 200 students, and that
there was not to be any discussion during the lectures. No two
conditions could be more likely to put him off. He told Malcolm: ’I
don’t think I can give formal lectures to a large audience that would be
any good.’37</p>
<p>Concerned that Wittgenstein’s money would soon run out, Malcolm
approached the Rockefeller Foundation on his behalf. He told
Wittgenstein that he had managed to interest a director of the
foundation, Chadbourne Gilpatrick, in the possibility of awarding him a
research grant. Wittgenstein’s gratitude for this was tempered by a
remarkable piece of fiercely honest self-assessment. There were, of
course, reasons to accept the grant:</p>
<p>The thought of being able to live where I like, of not having to be a
burden or a nuisance to others, of doing philosophy when my nature
inclines me to do it is, of course, pleasant for me.38</p>
<p>But, he told Malcolm, he could not take the money unless the
Rockefeller Foundation ‘knew the complete truth about me’:</p>
<p>The truth is this. a) I have not been able to do any sustained good
work since the beginning of March 1949. b) Even before that date I could
not work well for more than 6 or 7 months a year, c) As I’m getting
older my thoughts become markedly less forceful andandandand crystallize
more rarely andandandand I get tired very much more easily. d) My health
is in a somewhat labile state owing to a constant slight anaemia which
inclines me to catch infections. This further diminishes the chance of
my doing really good work. e) Though it’s impossible for me to make any
definite predictions, it seems to me likely that my mind will never
again work as vigorously as it did, say, 14 months ago. f) I cannot
promise to publish anything during my lifetime.</p>
<p>He asked Malcolm to show this letter to the foundation’s directors.
‘It is obviously impossible to accept a grant under false pretences,
andandandand you may unintentionally have presented my case in too rosy
a light.’ ‘I believe’, he added, ‘that as long as I live andandandand as
often as the state of my mind permits it I will think about
philosophical problems andandandand try to write about them’:</p>
<p>I also believe that much of what I wrote in the past 15 or 20 years
may be of interest to people when it’s published. But it is,
nevertheless, perfectly possible that all that I’m going to produce will
be flat, uninspired andandandand uninteresting.</p>
<p>When, eight months later, he was visited by Gilpatrick, Wittgenstein
told him: ‘in my present state of health andandandand intellectual
dullness I couldn’t accept a grant’.39</p>
<p>He attributed his ‘intellectual dullness’ in part to the oestrogens
that he was taking to alleviate the symptoms of his cancer. While taking
them he found the intense concentration required to write philosophy
difficult to achieve. ‘I’m doing some work’, he told Malcolm, on 17
April, ’but I get stuck over simple things andandandand almost all I
write is pretty dull.’40</p>
<p>The work in question forms Part III of On Colour, and is a
continuation of the remarks on Goethe’s Farbenlehre that he wrote in
Vienna. In some ways it bears out Wittgenstein’s own assessment of it:
it is a repetitive and rather laboured attempt to clarify the ‘logic of
colour concepts’, in particular the concepts of ‘primary colour’,
‘transparency’ and ‘luminosity’. Wittgenstein’s dissatisfaction with it
is manifest: ’That which I am writing about so tediously, may be obvious
to someone whose mind is less decrepit.’41 It does, however, contain a
marvellously succinct dismissal of Goethe’s remarks on the general
characteristics of various colours:</p>
<p>One and the same musical theme has a different character in the minor
than in the major, but it is completely wrong to speak of the character
of the minor mode in general.42 (In Schubert the major often sounds more
sorrowful than the minor.)</p>
<p>And in this way I think that it is worthless and of no use whatsoever
for the understanding of painting to speak of the characteristics of the
individual colours. When we do it, we are really thinking of special
uses. That green as the colour of a tablecloth has this, red that
effect, does not allow us to draw any conclusions as to their effect in
a picture.</p>
<p>Imagine someone pointing to a spot in the iris in a face by Rembrandt
and saying ‘the wall in my room should be painted this colour’.43</p>
<p>It was while he was staying with the von Wrights in April 1950 that
the last photographs of Wittgenstein were taken. They show Wittgenstein
and von Wright sitting together in folding chairs in front of a bed
sheet. This odd arrangement was, as K. E. Tranøy (who took the
photographs) remembers, Wittgenstein’s own idea:</p>
<p>In the late spring of 1950 we had tea with the von Wrights in the
garden.44 It was a sunny day and I asked Wittgenstein if I could take a
photograph of him. He said, yes, I could do that, if I would let him sit
with his back to the lens. I had no objections and went to get my
camera. In the meantime Wittgenstein had changed his mind. He now
decided I was to take the picture in the style of a passport photograph,
and von Wright was to sit next to him. Again I agreed, and Wittgenstein
now walked off to get the sheet from his bed; he would not accept
Elizabeth von Wright’s offer of a fresh sheet from her closets.
Wittgenstein draped the sheet, hanging it in front of the verandah, and
pulled up two chairs.</p>
<p>On 25 April Wittgenstein left Cambridge to move into Elizabeth
Anscombe’s house in St John Street, Oxford. ‘I like to stay with the von
Wrights’, he told Malcolm, ‘but the two children are noisy andandandand
I need quiet.’45 At Anscombe’s house he occupied a room on the second
floor, the ground floor being occupied by Frank and Gillian Goodrich,
and the first by Barry Pink. Soon after he moved in he told von Wright:
‘The house isn’t very noisy but not very quiet, either.46 I don’t know
yet how I shall get on. The lodgers seem all to be rather nice, and one
of them even very nice.’</p>
<p>The ‘very nice’ one was Barry Pink, who was then attending art
college. His interests were many and varied: ‘Pink wants to sit on six
stools at once’, Wittgenstein once remarked, ’but he only has one
arse.’47 Pink had long been a friend of Yorick Smythies, and, like
Smythies and Anscombe, was a convert to Catholicism. He found in
Wittgenstein someone willing and able to converse with him about the
whole range of his interests – art, sculpture, stone-masonry,
machine-construction and so on.</p>
<p>The two took walks together around Oxford, and for a time Pink became
a confidant. They were able to discuss their thoughts, feelings and
lives with a fair degree of frankness. They discussed, for example, the
tendency to hide one’s real nature. In connection with this, Pink asked
Wittgenstein whether he thought his work as a philosopher, even his
being a philosopher, had anything to do with his homosexuality. What was
implied was that Wittgenstein’s work as a philosopher may in some way
have been a device to hide from his homosexuality. Wittgenstein
dismissed the question with anger in his voice: ’Certainly not!’48</p>
<p>Wittgenstein planned to spend the summer in Norway with Ben, who was
then in his final year as a medical student at Bart’s in London. In
July, however, Ben failed his final qualifying exams, and so had to stay
in London during the summer to study for the ‘retake’ in September.
Their holiday was therefore postponed until the autumn, and Wittgenstein
stayed in Oxford throughout the summer, devoting himself to a
continuation of the remarks on colour that he had written in
Cambridge.</p>
<p>In the same manuscript notebook as the remarks on colour is a series
of remarks on Shakespeare, which have been published in Culture and
Value (see here). Wittgenstein had long been troubled by his inability
to appreciate the greatness of Shakespeare. In 1946, for example, he had
written:</p>
<p>It is remarkable how hard we find it to believe something that we do
not see the truth of for ourselves.49 When, for instance, I hear the
expression of admiration for Shakespeare by distinguished men in the
course of several centuries, I can never rid myself of the suspicion
that praising him has been the conventional thing to do; though I have
to tell myself that this is not how it is. It takes the authority of a
Milton really to convince me. I take it for granted that he was
incorruptible. – But I don’t of course mean by this that I don’t believe
an enormous amount of praise to have been, and still to be, lavished on
Shakespeare without understanding and for the wrong reasons by a
thousand professors of literature.</p>
<p>One of the difficulties he had in accepting Shakespeare as a great
poet was that he disliked many of Shakespeare’s metaphors and similes:
‘Shakespeare’s similes are, in the ordinary sense, bad.50 So if they are
all the same good – and I don’t know whether they are or not – they must
be a law to themselves.’ An example he discussed with Ben was the use of
a portcullis as a metaphor for teeth in Mowbray’s speech in Richard II:
‘Within my mouth you have engaol’d my tongue/ Doubly portcullis’d with
my teeth and lips.’</p>
<p>A more fundamental difficulty was Wittgenstein’s dislike of English
culture in general: ‘I believe that if one is to enjoy a writer one has
to like the culture he belongs to as well.51 If one finds it indifferent
or distasteful, one’s admiration cools off.’ This did not prevent
Wittgenstein from admiring Blake or Dickens. The difference is that, in
Shakespeare, Wittgenstein could not see a writer whom he could admire as
a great human being:</p>
<p>I could only stare in wonder at Shakespeare; never do anything with
him …52</p>
<p>‘Beethoven’s great heart’ – nobody could speak of ‘Shakespeare’s
great heart’ …</p>
<p>I do not think that Shakespeare would have been able to reflect on
the ‘lot of the poet’.</p>
<p>Nor could he regard himself as a prophet or as a teacher of
mankind.</p>
<p>People stare at him in wonderment, almost as at a spectacular natural
phenomenon. They do not have the feeling that this brings them into
contact with a great human being. Rather with a phenomenon.</p>
<p>In Dickens, on the other hand, Wittgenstein did find an English
writer whom he could respect for his ‘good universal art’ – in the
Tolstoyan sense of art that is intelligible to everyone, and that
espouses Christian virtues. He gave a pocket edition of A Christmas
Carol, bound in green leather and plastered with cheerful ‘Merry Xmas’
stickers, to Fouracre as a belated Christmas present when Fouracre
returned from Sumatra. The choice of book, of course, is significant. F.
R. Leavis recalls that Wittgenstein knew A Christmas Carol practically
by heart, and the book is, in fact, placed by Tolstoy in his treatise
What is Art? in the very highest category of art ‘flowing from the love
of God’. It is thus a highly appropriate gift to make within a
friendship that stands out in Wittgenstein’s life as a rare example of
his Tolstoyan respect for ‘the common man’, exemplified in a simple and
straightforward affection for an ordinary working man.</p>
<p>In the late summer of 1950 Wittgenstein resumed his remarks on the
philosophical significance of Moore’s ‘common-sense propositions’. This
work now constitutes remarks 65–299 of On Certainty. In it Wittgenstein
elaborates on the idea that Moore’s statements have the peculiarity that
their denial is not just false, but incomprehensible:</p>
<p>If Moore were to pronounce the opposite of those propositions which
he declares certain, we should not just not share his opinion: we should
regard him as demented.53</p>
<p>Thus: ‘if I make certain false statements, it becomes uncertain
whether I understand them.’ Moore gives us examples of such statements.
Another example might be knowing where one lives:</p>
<p>For months I have lived at address A, I have read the name of the
street and the number of the house countless times, have received
countless letters here and have given countless people the address.54 If
I am wrong about it, the mistake is hardly less than if I were (wrongly)
to believe I was writing Chinese and not German.</p>
<p>If my friend were to imagine one day that he had been living for a
long time past in such and such a place, etc. etc., I should not call
this a mistake, but rather a mental disturbance, perhaps a transient
one.</p>
<p>A mistake becomes, for us, a mental disturbance when it contradicts,
not just this or that proposition which we believe to be true, but the
whole framework within which we can give grounds for our beliefs. The
only occasion Wittgenstein can think of in which it would be appropriate
for Moore to assert: ‘I know that I have not left the surface of the
earth’, would be one in which he is faced by people operating within a
vastly different framework:</p>
<p>I could imagine Moore being captured by a wild tribe, and their
expressing the suspicion that he has come from somewhere between the
earth and the moon.55 Moore tells them that he knows etc. but he can’t
give them the grounds for his certainty, because they have fantastic
ideas of human ability to fly and know nothing about physics. This would
be an occasion for making that statement.</p>
<p>But this example indicates that a different framework is not
necessarily evidence of insanity. In 1950 it was absurd to suppose that
someone might have been in outer space and returned to earth. We have
now grown accustomed to the idea. Frameworks change, both between
different cultures and within a culture between different times.</p>
<p>This, though, is not a point against Wittgenstein. On the contrary,
he stresses that a framework itself cannot be justified or proven
correct; it provides the limits within which justification and proof
take place:</p>
<p>Everything that I have seen or heard gives me the conviction that no
man has ever been far from the earth.56 Nothing in my picture of the
world speaks in favour of the opposite.</p>
<p>But I did not get my picture of the world by satisfying myself of its
correctness; nor do I have it because I am satisfied of its correctness.
No: it is the inherited background against which I distinguish between
true and false.</p>
<p>Frameworks change: what was once dismissed as absurd may now be
accepted; hard and fast certainties become dislodged and abandoned.
Nevertheless, we cannot make sense of anything without some sort of
framework, and with any particular framework there has to be a
distinction between propositions that, using that framework, describe
the world, and those that describe the framework itself, though this
distinction is not fixed at the same place for ever:</p>
<p>… the river-bed of thoughts may shift.57 But I distinguish between
the movements of the waters on the river-bed and the shift of the bed
itself; though there is not a sharp division of the one from the
other.</p>
<p>We do not, however, need to consider imaginary wild tribes to find
examples of people with a world picture fundamentally different to our
own:</p>
<p>I believe that every human being has two parents; but Catholics
believe that Jesus only had a human mother.58 And other people might
believe that there are human beings with no parents, and give no
credence to all the contrary evidence. Catholics believe as well that in
certain circumstances a wafer completely changes its nature, and at the
same time that all evidence proves the contrary. And so if Moore said ‘I
know that this is wine and not blood’, Catholics would contradict
him.</p>
<p>This remark was possibly prompted by a conversation about
Transsubstantiation that Wittgenstein had with Anscombe about this time.
He was, it seems, surprised to hear from Anscombe that it really was
Catholic belief that ‘in certain circumstances a wafer completely
changes its nature’. It is presumably an example of what he had in mind
when he remarked to Malcolm about Anscombe and Smythies: ‘I could not
possibly bring myself to believe all the things that they believe.’ Such
beliefs could find no place in his own world picture. His respect for
Catholicism, however, prevented him from regarding them as mistakes or
‘transient mental disturbances’.</p>
<p>‘I have a world picture. Is it true or false? Above all it is the
substratum of all my enquiring and asserting.’59 There is no reason why
a religious faith should not provide this substratum, and why religious
beliefs should not be part of ‘the inherited background against which I
distinguish between true and false’. But for this a thoroughgoing
religious education and instruction may be necessary: ’Perhaps one could
“convince someone that God exists” by means of a certain upbringing, by
shaping his life in such and such a way.’60</p>
<p>But what intelligibility can religious belief have in the absence of
such an upbringing? Wittgenstein seems to have thought the concept of
God can, in some cases (his own for example), be forced upon one by
life:</p>
<p>Life can educate one to a belief in God. And experiences too are what
bring this about; but I don’t mean visions and other forms of experience
which show us the ‘existence of this being’, but, e.g., sufferings of
various sorts.61 These neither show us an object, nor do they give rise
to conjectures about him. Experiences, thoughts, – life can force this
concept on us.</p>
<p>So perhaps it is similar to the concept of ‘object’.</p>
<p>Of course, in this case, the form that this faith takes is unlikely
to be acceptance, or even comprehension, of the Catholic doctrines of
the Virgin Conception and Transsubstantiation. What is forced upon one
is, rather, a certain attitude:</p>
<p>The attitude that’s in question is that of taking a certain matter
seriously and then, beyond a certain point, no longer regarding it as
serious, but maintaining that something else is even more
important.62</p>
<p>Someone may for instance say it’s a grave matter that such and such a
man should have died before he could complete a certain piece of work;
and yet, in another sense, this is not what matters. At this point one
uses the words ‘in a deeper sense’. Actually I should like to say that
in this case too the words you utter or what you think as you utter them
are not what matters, so much as the difference they make at various
points in your life. How do I know that two people mean the same when
each says he believes in God? And the same goes for belief in the
Trinity. A theology which insists on the use of certain particular words
and phrases, and outlaws others, does not make anything clearer (Karl
Barth). It gesticulates with words, as one might say, because it wants
to say something and does not know how to express it. Practice gives the
words their sense.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s example in the second paragraph is not, of course,
arbitrary. But if, as it implies, the completion of Philosophical
Investigations before his death is not what matters, then what is this
‘something else’ that, ‘in a deeper sense’, is even more important?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be: his reconciliation with God. In the autumn
Wittgenstein asked Anscombe if she could put him touch with a
‘non-philosophical’ priest. He did not want to discuss the finer points
of Catholic doctrine; he wanted to be introduced to someone to whose
life religious belief had made a practical difference. She introduced
him to Father Conrad, the Dominican priest who had instructed Yorick
Smythies during his conversion to Catholicism. Conrad came to Anscombe’s
house twice to talk to Wittgenstein. ‘He wanted’, Conrad recalls, ‘to
talk to a priest as a priest and did not wish to discuss philosophical
problems’:63</p>
<p>He knew he was very ill and wanted to talk about God, I think with a
view to coming back fully to his religion, but in fact we only had, I
think, two conversations on God and the soul in rather general
terms.</p>
<p>Anscombe, however, doubts that Wittgenstein wanted to see Conrad
‘with a view to coming back fully to his religion’, if by that Conrad
means that Wittgenstein wanted to return to the Catholic Church. And,
given Wittgenstein’s explicit statements that he could not believe
certain doctrines of the Catholic Church, it seems reasonable to accept
her doubt.</p>
<p>In September Ben successfully retook his final qualifying exams,
leaving him free to join Wittgenstein on their postponed visit to
Norway. In the first week of October, therefore, they set off on the
long and difficult journey to Wittgenstein’s remote hut by the side of
the Sogne fjord.</p>
<p>To travel so far north at that time of the year might have been
considered a foolhardy risk for Wittgenstein to take in his precarious
state of health. It was, however, Ben’s health that suffered from the
cold. After they had been in Norway a short time he developed bronchitis
and had to be moved from Wittgenstein’s hut into a nursing home further
up the fjord. They then moved into Anna Rebni’s farmhouse, where they
spent the remainder of their holiday.</p>
<p>Ben had taken with him a copy of J. L. Austin’s recently published
translation of Frege’s Foundations of Arithmetic, and while in Norway he
and Wittgenstein spent much time reading and discussing Frege’s work.
Wittgenstein began to think that he might, after all, be able to live
alone once again in Norway and work on philosophy.</p>
<p>On his return to Oxford, he wrote to von Wright that, in spite of
Ben’s illness, ‘we enjoyed our stay enormously’:64</p>
<p>We had excellent weather the whole time and were surrounded by the
greatest kindness. I decided then and there that I’d return to Norway to
work there. I get no real quiet here. If all goes well I shall sail on
Dec. 30th and go to Skjolden again. I don’t think I’ll be able to stay
in my hut because the physical work I’ve got to do there is too heavy
for me, but an old friend told me that she’d let me stay at her
farmhouse. Of course I don’t know whether I’m able any more to do decent
work, but at least I’m giving myself a real chance. If I can’t work
there I can’t work anywhere.</p>
<p>He even booked a passage on a steamer from Newcastle to Bergen for 30
December. Shortly before Christmas, however, he was told by Anna Rebni
that she could not put him up after all. Wittgenstein was, in any case,
in no fit state to make the journey. While visiting Dr Bevan to have an
examination before his proposed trip to Norway, he had fallen ill in
Bevan’s house, and had to remain there for Christmas. None of this
deterred him from his plan, however, and after Christmas he wrote to
Arne Bolstad, another friend in Norway, asking him if he knew of a
suitable place for him to live and work in isolation. This, too, came to

<p>His plans to go to Norway thwarted, Wittgenstein tried another
favoured refuge: a monastery. Father Conrad made arrangements on
Wittgenstein’s behalf for him to stay at a Blackfriars Priory in the
Midlands, where he could live the life of a Brother, doing the house
chores such as washing up and, most important, where he could be
alone.</p>
<p>By January 1951, however, Wittgenstein’s health made all these plans
impractical. He needed constant medical attention. As his condition
worsened, he had to travel to Cambridge with increasing frequency to see
Dr Bevan. In addition to the hormones he was taking, he was also given
X-ray treatment at Addenbrooke’s Hospital.</p>
<p>He had a deep horror of the idea of dying in an English hospital, but
Bevan promised him that, if necessary, he could spend his last days
being looked after at Bevan’s own home. At the beginning of February,
Wittgenstein decided to accept his offer, and so moved to Cambridge,
there to die in Bevan’s home: ‘Storeys End’.</p>
<p>fn1 Fouracre had finally returned from Sumatra in February 1947, and
from then until Wittgenstein’s death the two continued their friendship,
meeting regularly both in London and in Cambridge. Whenever Wittgenstein
was away he would write to Fouracre with the same regularity as he had
when Fouracre was in the army. Letters survive written from Dublin,
Vienna and Oxford, as well as Ithaca.</p>
