<h4 id="appendix">APPENDIX:</h4>
<p>BARTLEY’S WITTGENSTEIN AND THE CODED REMARKS</p>
<p>ONE OF THE books that has done most to stimulate interest in
Wittgenstein’s life in recent years has been W. W. Bartley III’s short
study, Wittgenstein. This is an account of Wittgenstein’s ‘lost years’,
from 1919 to 1929, during which he abandoned philosophy and worked as an
elementary school teacher in rural Austria. Bartley’s chief interest in
writing the book seems to have been to emphasize the philosophical
relevance of this part of Wittgenstein’s life, and, in particular, the
influence on Wittgenstein’s later philosophy of the educational theories
of the Austrian School Reform Movement (the movement that shaped
educational policy in Austria after the First World War).</p>
<p>Interest in Bartley’s book, however, has tended to focus, not on his
main themes, but almost exclusively on the sensational claims he makes
towards the beginning of it about Wittgenstein’s sexuality. The interest
generated by these assertions is, in my opinion, disproportionate, but I
feel obliged to say something about them. The question I was asked most
during the writing of this book was: ‘What are you going to do about
Bartley?’ – meaning: what response was I going to give in my book to
Bartley’s claims about Wittgenstein’s homosexual promiscuity?</p>
<p>What are these claims? According to Bartley, while Wittgenstein was
training as a school teacher and living on his own in lodgings in
Vienna, he discovered an area in the nearby Prater (a large park in
Vienna, analogous, perhaps, to Richmond Park in London), where ‘rough
young men were ready to cater to him sexually’. Once Wittgenstein had
discovered this place, Bartley maintains:</p>
<p>[he] found to his horror that he could scarcely keep away from it.
Several nights each week he would break away from his rooms and make the
quick walk to the Prater, possessed, as he put it to friends, by a demon
he could barely control. Wittgenstein found he much preferred the sort
of rough blunt homosexual youth he could find strolling the paths and
alleys of the Prater to those ostensibly more refined young men who
frequented the Sirk Ecke in the Kärtnerstrasse and the neighbouring bars
at the edge of the city. [Wittgenstein, see here]</p>
<p>In an ‘Afterword’, written in 1985 and published in a revised edition
of his book, Bartley clears up one widespread misinterpretation of this
passage. He had not, it seems, meant to imply that the ‘rough young men’
in question were prostitutes. But, cleared of this misunderstanding, he
stands by the truth of what he says.</p>
<p>He does not, however, clear up the mystery of how he knows it to be
true. Neither in this revised edition of the book nor in the original
does he give any source for these claims. He says merely that his
information is based on ‘confidential reports from his [Wittgenstein’s]
friends’.</p>
<p>Ever since it appeared, this passage has been the subject of a heated
and apparently unresolvable controversy. Many who knew Wittgenstein well
felt outraged, and vented their anger in reviews and letters to
periodicals pouring scorn on Bartley’s book and swearing that his claims
about Wittgenstein’s sexuality were false – that they had to be false,
since the Wittgenstein they knew could not have done such things.</p>
<p>On the other hand, many who did not know Wittgenstein but who had
read his published correspondence and the memoirs of him written by his
friends and students felt inclined to believe what Bartley said – felt,
in fact, that Bartley had provided the key to Wittgenstein’s tormented
personality. A few (though not Bartley himself) even thought that these
sexual encounters provided the key to understanding Wittgenstein’s
philosophy. Colin Wilson, for example, in his book The Misfits: A Study
of Sexual Outsiders (the theme of which is the connection between genius
and sexual perversion), states that it was only after he had read
Bartley’s book that he felt he understood Wittgenstein’s work.</p>
<p>Many people, it seems, find it so natural to think of Wittgenstein as
guiltily and promiscuously homosexual that they are inclined to accept
Bartley’s claims without any evidence. It somehow ‘fits’ with their
image of Wittgenstein – so much so that the picture of Wittgenstein
guiltily wandering the paths of the Prater in search of ‘rough young
homosexual youths’ has become an indelible part of the public image of
him. Wittgenstein is, I was once assured, the ‘Joe Orton of
philosophy’.</p>
<p>Another reason, I think, why Bartley’s claims have been generally
accepted is the widespread feeling that Wittgenstein’s friends, and
especially his literary executors, would not admit the truth of such
things, even if they knew them to be true. There is, it is felt, a
cover-up going on. One of Wittgenstein’s executors, Professor Elizabeth
Anscombe, gave ammunition to that view when, in a letter to Paul
Engelmann (published in the introduction to Engelmann’s Letters from
Ludwig Wittgenstein with a Memoir), she stated:</p>
<p>If by pressing a button it could have been secured that people would
not concern themselves with his personal life I should have pressed the
button.</p>
<p>Further ammunition has been provided by the executors’ attitude to
the personal remarks that Wittgenstein wrote in his philosophical
manuscripts – the so-called coded diaries.</p>
<p>These remarks were separated by Wittgenstein from his philosophical
remarks by being written in a very simple code that he had learnt as a
child (whereby a = z, b = y, c = x etc.). The simplicity of the code,
and the fact that Wittgenstein used it to write instructions concerning
the publication of his work, suggest that he used it, not to disguise
what he was saying from posterity, but, rather, to disguise it from
someone who, say, happened to lean over his shoulder or who happened to
see his manuscript volume lying on a table.</p>
<p>A collection of these remarks, the less personal of them, has been
published under the title Culture and Value. The more personal remarks
have remained unpublished. In the microfilm edition of Wittgenstein’s
complete manuscripts, these more personal remarks have been covered up
with bits of paper.</p>
<p>All this has (a) increased people’s curiosity about what the coded
remarks contain; and (b) confirmed their view that the executors are
hiding something. And this, in turn, has helped to create a climate of
opinion favourable to the acceptance of Bartley’s otherwise
extraordinary allegations. ‘Aha!’ people have thought. ‘So that’s what
Anscombe has been covering up all these years!’</p>
<p>Bartley himself has made use of this climate of opinion to defend
himself against accusations of peddling falsehoods. In the
aforementioned ‘Afterword’ (which is subtitled ‘A Polemical Reply to my
critics’), he alleges that the executors were bluffing when they
expressed their outrage at his book. For all the time they:</p>
<p>… had coded notebooks, in Wittgenstein’s own hand, written in a very
simple cipher and long since decoded and transcribed, corroborating my
statements about his homosexuality.</p>
<p>Now this is actually not true. In the coded remarks Wittgenstein does
discuss his love for, first David Pinsent, then Francis Skinner, and
finally Ben Richards (this is over a period of some thirty years or so),
and in that sense they do ‘corroborate’ his homosexuality. But they do
nothing to corroborate Bartley’s statements about Wittgenstein’s
homosexuality. That is, there is not a word in them about going to the
Prater in search of ‘rough young men’, nor is there anything to suggest
that Wittgenstein engaged in promiscuous behaviour at any time in his
life. Reading them, one would rather get the impression that he was
incapable of such promiscuity, so troubled does he seem by even the
slightest manifestation of sexual desire (homosexual or
heterosexual).</p>
<p>Not many people would have been able to point this out, because few
have ever seen the coded remarks. Indeed, the way Bartley himself talks
of ‘coded notebooks’ suggests that his information, too, is second-hand
– that he has not actually seen the sources he mentions. There simply
are no coded notebooks. The coded remarks are not gathered together in
two volumes (as Bartley appears to think), but are scattered throughout
the eighty or so notebooks that constitute Wittgenstein’s literary and
philosophical Nachlass. This alleged ‘corroboration’, then, is entirely
spurious.</p>
<p>Of the many attempts to refute Bartley, the most often quoted are
those by Rush Rhees and J. J. Stonborough in The Human World (No. 14,
Feb. 1972). They are, in my opinion, unsuccessful. Rhees, indeed, does
not even attempt to refute Bartley in the ordinary sense of showing what
Bartley says to be false. The gist of his argument is that, even if what
Bartley says is true, it was ‘foul’ of him to repeat it. Stonborough’s
piece, stripped of its bombast, its heavy-handed irony and its moral
indignation, contains only one, rather flimsy, argument: that if
Wittgenstein had behaved as Bartley suggests, he would have been
blackmailed. This argument is quite easily dealt with by Bartley in his
‘Afterword’. By concentrating on the morality of Bartley’s book, rather
than on the veracity of his information, Rhees and Stonborough have, I
believe, merely clouded the issue, and, inadvertently, let Bartley off
the hook.</p>
<p>The only way in which Bartley’s statements could be effectively
refuted is by showing, either that the information he received was
false, or that he had misinterpreted it. And before that can even be
attempted, it is necessary to know what that information was. This,
Bartley has resolutely refused to reveal.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Bartley’s book there are signs that, in writing it, he
had access to a manuscript of Wittgenstein’s dating from the years
1919–20. The most striking indication of this occurs on see here (of the
revised edition), when he quotes a dream-report of Wittgenstein’s and
comments on Wittgenstein’s own interpretation of the dream. I find it
impossible to imagine how Bartley’s information here could have come
from any other source than a document written by Wittgenstein himself.
If it strains credulity to think that Wittgenstein’s friends supplied
Bartley with accounts of his trips to the Prater, it positively defies
belief that they gave him reports of Wittgenstein’s dreams, told in the
first person.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in the aforementioned coded remarks, Wittgenstein does
occasionally record and comment on his dreams (three examples can be
found in this book, on here, here and here). And the discussion of the
dream that Bartley quotes, though more elaborate than anything else that
has been preserved, is entirely consistent with the interest that
Wittgenstein showed at various times in Freud’s techniques of
interpreting dreams.</p>
<p>Thus, there is every reason to believe that the dream-reports that
Bartley gives are real, and, therefore, a prima facie reason to think
that Bartley had access to a manuscript, the existence of which is
unknown to Wittgenstein’s literary executors (indeed, which has been
kept from them). The executors have no manuscripts belonging to the
years 1919 and 1920, even though it is quite likely that there were
some.</p>
<p>If this (admittedly highly speculative) hypothesis is correct, then
this manuscript might also be the source for the alleged ‘Prater
episodes’. In correspondence with Bartley, I asked him directly whether
there was such a manuscript or not. He neither confirmed nor rejected
the suggestion; he said only that to reveal his source of information
would be to betray a confidence, and that he was not prepared to be so
dishonourable. I therefore regard the hypothesis as still awaiting
falsification.</p>
<p>In writing this book, I have had unrestricted access to all the coded
remarks in possession of the literary executors, and permission to quote
any of them that I wish. I have chosen to quote virtually all the
remarks that are in any way revealing of Wittgenstein’s emotional,
spiritual and sexual life. (Discretion, as Lytton Strachey once said, is
not the better part of biography.) I have left nothing out that would
lend support to the popular notion that Wittgenstein was tormented by
his homosexuality, although I myself believe this to be a simplification
that seriously misrepresents the truth.</p>
<p>What the coded remarks reveal is that Wittgenstein was uneasy, not
about homosexuality, but about sexuality itself. Love, whether of a man
or a woman, was something he treasured. He regarded it as a gift, almost
as a divine gift. But, together with Weininger (whose Sex and Character
spells out, I believe, many attitudes towards love and sex that are
implicit in much that Wittgenstein said, wrote and did), he sharply
differentiated love from sex. Sexual arousal, both homo- and
heterosexual, troubled him enormously. He seemed to regard it as
incompatible with the sort of person he wanted to be.</p>
<p>What the coded remarks also reveal is the extraordinary extent to
which Wittgenstein’s love life and his sexual life went on only in his
imagination. This is most striking in the case of Keith Kirk (for whom
Wittgenstein formed a brief obsession that he regarded as ‘unfaithful’
to his love for Francis Skinner; see here to here), but it is also
evident in almost all of Wittgenstein’s intimate relationships.
Wittgenstein’s perception of a relationship would often bear no relation
at all to the perception of it held by the other person. If I had not
met Keith Kirk, I would have been almost certain, from what I had read
in the coded remarks, that he and Wittgenstein had had some kind of
‘affair’. Having met Kirk, I am certain that whatever affair there was
existed only in Wittgenstein’s mind.</p>
<p>If I may be allowed a final twist to my speculations concerning
Bartley: I believe it to be possible that his information came from
coded remarks contained in a manuscript written between 1919 and 1920,
but that he has been too hasty in inferring from those remarks that
Wittgenstein engaged in sexually promiscuous behaviour. It would be
entirely in keeping with what else we know about Wittgenstein that he
did indeed find the ‘rough, young, homosexual youths’ that he discovered
in the Prater fascinating, that he returned again and again to the spot
from where he could see them, and that he recorded his fascination in
diary form in his notebooks. But it would also be entirely in keeping
with what we know that the youths themselves knew nothing at all about
his fascination, and indeed were unaware of his existence. If
Wittgenstein was ‘sexually promiscuous’ with street youths, it was, I
believe, in the same sense that he was ‘unfaithful’ to Francis
Skinner.</p>

<p>REFERENCES</p>
<p>WITTGENSTEIN’S MANUSCRIPTS ARE kept in the Wren Library, Trinity
College, Cambridge. They are cited here according to the numbers
assigned them by Professor G. H. von Wright in his article ‘The
Wittgenstein Papers’ (see Wittgenstein, Blackwell, 1982). In the text,
the extracts have been given in English. Where this follows a previously
published translation, I cite here only the published reference. Where
it is my translation of an extract previously published (or quoted) only
in German, I give the manuscript reference, together with a reference to
the original publication. In cases where I have translated a previously
unpublished extract, I give the manuscript reference, together with the
original German text. I have followed this procedure also with some of
the more important letters from Frege to Wittgenstein.</p>
<p>Wittgenstein’s letters to Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore, J. M.
Keynes, W. Eccles, Paul Engelmann, Ludwig von Ficker, C. K. Ogden and G.
H. von Wright have been published in the various editions of letters
listed in the Bibliography. His letters to Ludwig Hänsel are published
as an appendix in Der Volksschullehrer Ludwig Wittgenstein, by Konrad
Wünsche. His letters to his sisters Hermine and Helene, and to his
friends Roy Fouracre, Rowland Hutt, Gilbert Pattisson, Rush Rhees,
Moritz Schlick and Friedrich Waismann are hitherto unpublished unless
otherwise indicated, and remain in private hands.</p>
<p>The letters to Wittgenstein from Engelmann, Eccles, Gottlob Frege,
von Ficker, Hänsel, Adele and Stanislav Jolles, Ogden, David Pinsent and
Russell are held by the Brenner Archive, Innsbruck. Those from Francis
Skinner are in private hands.</p>
<p>The letters from Russell to Lady Ottoline Morrell are held by the
Humanities Research Center, University of Texas, and have been
extensively quoted in at least three previous publications: The Life of
Bertrand Russell, by Ronald W. Clark; Wittgenstein: A Life, by Brian
McGuinness; and ‘The Early Wittgenstein and the Middle Russell’, by
Kenneth Blackwell (in Perspectives on the Philosophy of Wittgenstein,
ed. Irving Block).</p>
<p>The letters between Drs Grant, Bywater, Herrald and Landsborough
Thomson quoted in Chapter 21 are held by the Medical Research Council
(MRC) Library, London. Records of the interviews with Adolf Hübner
quoted in Chapter 9 are held by the Wittgenstein Documentation Centre in
Kirchberg, Lower Austria.</p>
<p>In the notes that follow, Recollections of Wittgenstein, ed. Rush
Rhees, is abbreviated as Recollections; Ludwig Wittgenstein as ‘LW’; and
his co-correspondents as follows:</p>
