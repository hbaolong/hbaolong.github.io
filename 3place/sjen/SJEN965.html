耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 31章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>31:1 At the same time, saith the LORD, will I be the God of all the
families of Israel, and they shall be my people.</p>
<p>31:2 Thus saith the LORD, The people which were left of the sword
found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to
rest.</p>
<p>31:3 The LORD hath appeared of old unto me, saying, Yea, I have loved
thee with an everlasting love: therefore with lovingkindness have I
drawn thee.</p>
<p>31:4 Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of
Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth
in the dances of them that make merry.</p>
<p>31:5 Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the
planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things.</p>
<p>31:6 For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount
Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion unto the LORD our
God.</p>
<p>31:7 For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout
among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD,
save thy people, the remnant of Israel.</p>
<p>31:8 Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather
them from the coasts of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame,
the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a
great company shall return thither.</p>
<p>31:9 They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead
them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight
way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and
Ephraim is my firstborn.</p>
<p>31:10 Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the
isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and
keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock.</p>
<p>31:11 For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the
hand of him that was stronger than he.</p>
<p>31:12 Therefore they shall come and sing in the height of Zion, and
shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for
wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and
their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any
more at all.</p>
<p>31:13 Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and
old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort
them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow.</p>
<p>31:14 And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my
people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>31:15 Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation,
and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be
comforted for her children, because they were not.</p>
<p>31:16 Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine
eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and
they shall come again from the land of the enemy.</p>
<p>31:17 And there is hope in thine end, saith the LORD, that thy
children shall come again to their own border.</p>
<p>31:18 I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast
chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the
yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my
God.</p>
<p>31:19 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I
was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even
confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.</p>
<p>31:20 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I
spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my
bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith
the LORD.</p>
<p>31:21 Set thee up waymarks, make thee high heaps: set thine heart
toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest: turn again, O
virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.</p>
<p>31:22 How long wilt thou go about, O thou backsliding daughter? for
the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a
man.</p>
<p>31:23 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they
shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities thereof,
when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O
habitation of justice, and mountain of holiness.</p>
<p>31:24 And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all the cities
thereof together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks.</p>
<p>31:25 For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished
every sorrowful soul.</p>
<p>31:26 Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto
me.</p>
<p>31:27 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will sow the
house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with
the seed of beast.</p>
<p>31:28 And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over
them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy,
and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith
the LORD.</p>
<p>31:29 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a
sour grape, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.</p>
<p>31:30 But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that
eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.</p>
<p>31:31 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new
covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:</p>
<p>31:32 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in
the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of
Egypt; which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto
them, saith the LORD:</p>
<p>31:33 But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house
of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their
inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and
they shall be my people.</p>
<p>31:34 And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every
man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from
the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will
forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.</p>
<p>31:35 Thus saith the LORD, which giveth the sun for a light by day,
and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night,
which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The LORD of hosts is
his name:</p>
<p>31:36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then
the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for
ever.</p>
<p>31:37 Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the
foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all
the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>31:38 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be
built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel unto the gate of the
corner.</p>
<p>31:39 And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon
the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath.</p>
<p>31:40 And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and
all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse
gate toward the east, shall be holy unto the LORD; it shall not be
plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever.</p>
