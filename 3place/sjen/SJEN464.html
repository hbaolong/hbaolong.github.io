– 撒母耳记下(2 8:1 And after this it came to pass that David smote the
Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Methegammah out of the
hand of the Philistines.</h4>
<p>8:2 And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them
down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and
with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David’s
servants, and brought gifts.</p>
<p>8:3 David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as
he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</p>
<p>8:4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred
horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot
horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.</p>
<p>8:5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king
of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</p>
<p>8:6 Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians
became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved
David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p>8:7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of
Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>8:8 And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king
David took exceeding much brass.</p>
<p>8:9 When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host
of Hadadezer,</p>
<p>8:10 Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and
to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him:
for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought with him vessels of
silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:</p>
<p>8:11 Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the
silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he
subdued;</p>
<p>8:12 Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the
Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob,
king of Zobah.</p>
<p>8:13 And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the
Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.</p>
<p>8:14 And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he
garrisons, and all they of Edom became David’s servants. And the LORD
preserved David whithersoever he went.</p>
<p>8:15 And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment
and justice unto all his people.</p>
<p>8:16 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
the son of Ahilud was recorder;</p>
<p>8:17 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar,
were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;</p>
<p>8:18 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites
and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were chief rulers.</p>
