腓立比书(Philippians) – 第 2章 ( 本篇共有 4章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort
of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</p>
<p>2:2 Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love,
being of one accord, of one mind.</p>
<p>2:3 Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness
of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</p>
<p>2:4 Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the
things of others.</p>
<p>2:5 Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p>
<p>2:6 Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal
with God:</p>
<p>2:7 But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of
a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</p>
<p>2:8 And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and
became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</p>
<p>2:9 Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name
which is above every name:</p>
<p>2:10 That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in
heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</p>
<p>2:11 And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord,
to the glory of God the Father.</p>
<p>2:12 Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my
presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own
salvation with fear and trembling.</p>
<p>2:13 For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his
good pleasure.</p>
<p>2:14 Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</p>
<p>2:15 That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without
rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye
shine as lights in the world;</p>
<p>2:16 Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of
Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</p>
<p>2:17 Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your
faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</p>
<p>2:18 For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</p>
<p>2:19 But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto
you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</p>
<p>2:20 For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your
state.</p>
<p>2:21 For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus
Christ’s.</p>
<p>2:22 But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he
hath served with me in the gospel.</p>
<p>2:23 Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see
how it will go with me.</p>
<p>2:24 But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come
shortly.</p>
<p>2:25 Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my
brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger,
and he that ministered to my wants.</p>
<p>2:26 For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because
that ye had heard that he had been sick.</p>
<p>2:27 For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on
him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon
sorrow.</p>
<p>2:28 I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him
again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</p>
<p>2:29 Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold
such in reputation:</p>
<p>2:30 Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not
regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</p>
