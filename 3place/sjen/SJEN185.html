– 哥林多前书(1 15:1 Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel
which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye
stand;</h4>
<p>15:2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached
unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.</p>
<p>15:3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also
received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the
scriptures;</p>
<p>15:4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day
according to the scriptures:</p>
<p>15:5 And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:</p>
<p>15:6 After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once;
of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen
asleep.</p>
<p>15:7 After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles.</p>
<p>15:8 And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of
due time.</p>
<p>15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be
called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</p>
<p>15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was
bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than
they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</p>
<p>15:11 Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye
believed.</p>
<p>15:12 Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say
some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</p>
<p>15:13 But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not
risen:</p>
<p>15:14 And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and
your faith is also vain.</p>
<p>15:15 Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have
testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so
be that the dead rise not.</p>
<p>15:16 For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</p>
<p>15:17 And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in
your sins.</p>
<p>15:18 Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are
perished.</p>
<p>15:19 If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men
most miserable.</p>
<p>15:20 But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the
firstfruits of them that slept.</p>
<p>15:21 For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection
of the dead.</p>
<p>15:22 For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made
alive.</p>
<p>15:23 But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits;
afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.</p>
<p>15:24 Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the
kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule
and all authority and power.</p>
<p>15:25 For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his
feet.</p>
<p>15:26 The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</p>
<p>15:27 For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith
all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which
did put all things under him.</p>
<p>15:28 And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the
Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that
God may be all in all.</p>
<p>15:29 Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the
dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</p>
<p>15:30 And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</p>
<p>15:31 I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our
LORD, I die daily.</p>
<p>15:32 If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at
Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and
drink; for to morrow we die.</p>
<p>15:33 Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.</p>
<p>15:34 Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the
knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</p>
<p>15:35 But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with
what body do they come?</p>
<p>15:36 Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
die:</p>
<p>15:37 And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that
shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other
grain:</p>
<p>15:38 But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every
seed his own body.</p>
<p>15:39 All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh
of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of
birds.</p>
<p>15:40 There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is
another.</p>
<p>15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon,
and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star
in glory.</p>
<p>15:42 So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in
corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</p>
<p>15:43 It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in
weakness; it is raised in power:</p>
<p>15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There
is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</p>
<p>15:45 And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living
soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.</p>
<p>15:46 Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which
is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</p>
<p>15:47 The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the
Lord from heaven.</p>
<p>15:48 As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is
the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</p>
<p>15:49 And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly.</p>
<p>15:50 Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit
the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</p>
<p>15:51 Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we
shall all be changed,</p>
<p>15:52 In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for
the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and
we shall be changed.</p>
<p>15:53 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality.</p>
<p>15:54 So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and
this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass
the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</p>
<p>15:55 O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?</p>
<p>15:56 The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the
law.</p>
<p>15:57 But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our
Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>15:58 Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable,
always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your
labour is not in vain in the Lord.</p>
