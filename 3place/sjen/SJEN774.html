第 107章 ( 本篇共有 150章 )</h4>
<p>107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
endureth for ever.</p>
<p>107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from
the hand of the enemy;</p>
<p>107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the
west, from the north, and from the south.</p>
<p>107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
no city to dwell in.</p>
<p>107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</p>
<p>107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
delivered them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a
city of habitation.</p>
<p>107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his
wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul
with goodness.</p>
<p>107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
bound in affliction and iron;</p>
<p>107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
the counsel of the most High:</p>
<p>107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
down, and there was none to help.</p>
<p>107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
brake their bands in sunder.</p>
<p>107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
iron in sunder.</p>
<p>107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
iniquities, are afflicted.</p>
<p>107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
unto the gates of death.</p>
<p>107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
their destructions.</p>
<p>107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
declare his works with rejoicing.</p>
<p>107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
great waters;</p>
<p>107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the
deep.</p>
<p>107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
up the waves thereof.</p>
<p>107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
their soul is melted because of trouble.</p>
<p>107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
at their wit’s end.</p>
<p>107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
them out of their distresses.</p>
<p>107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
still.</p>
<p>107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
unto their desired haven.</p>
<p>107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
his wonderful works to the children of men!</p>
<p>107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
praise him in the assembly of the elders.</p>
<p>107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
dry ground;</p>
<p>107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
that dwell therein.</p>
<p>107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
ground into watersprings.</p>
<p>107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
a city for habitation;</p>
<p>107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
fruits of increase.</p>
<p>107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</p>
<p>107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
affliction, and sorrow.</p>
<p>107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
in the wilderness, where there is no way.</p>
<p>107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
him families like a flock.</p>
<p>107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
shall stop her mouth.</p>
<p>107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</p>
