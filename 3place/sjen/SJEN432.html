– 撒母耳记上(1 7:1 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the
ark of the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill,
and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the LORD.</h4>
<p>7:2 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that
the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the house of Israel
lamented after the LORD.</p>
<p>7:3 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye do
return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away the strange
gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare your hearts unto the
LORD, and serve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the
Philistines.</p>
<p>7:4 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
and served the LORD only.</p>
<p>7:5 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray for
you unto the LORD.</p>
<p>7:6 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured
it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have
sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged the children of Israel in
Mizpeh.</p>
<p>7:7 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were
gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines went up
against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard it, they were
afraid of the Philistines.</p>
<p>7:8 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto
the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand of the
Philistines.</p>
<p>7:9 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD for
Israel; and the LORD heard him.</p>
<p>7:10 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD thundered
with a great thunder on that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited
them; and they were smitten before Israel.</p>
<p>7:11 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.</p>
<p>7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the LORD
helped us.</p>
<p>7:13 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the
coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines
all the days of Samuel.</p>
<p>7:14 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were
restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the coasts thereof
did Israel deliver out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was
peace between Israel and the Amorites.</p>
<p>7:15 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</p>
<p>7:16 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and Gilgal,
and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.</p>
<p>7:17 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and there
he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the LORD.</p>
