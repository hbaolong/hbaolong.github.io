出埃及记(Exodus) – 第 7章 ( 本篇共有 40章 )</h4>
<p>7:1 And the LORD said unto Moses, See, I have made thee a god to
Pharaoh: and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.</p>
<p>7:2 Thou shalt speak all that I command thee: and Aaron thy brother
shall speak unto Pharaoh, that he send the children of Israel out of his
land.</p>
<p>7:3 And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart, and multiply my signs and my
wonders in the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>7:4 But Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, that I may lay my hand
upon Egypt, and bring forth mine armies, and my people the children of
Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</p>
<p>7:5 And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch
forth mine hand upon Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel from
among them.</p>
<p>7:6 And Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded them, so did
they.</p>
<p>7:7 And Moses was fourscore years old, and Aaron fourscore and three
years old, when they spake unto Pharaoh.</p>
<p>7:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p>7:9 When Pharaoh shall speak unto you, saying, Shew a miracle for
you: then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it before
Pharaoh, and it shall become a serpent.</p>
<p>7:10 And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as the
LORD had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and
before his servants, and it became a serpent.</p>
<p>7:11 Then Pharaoh also called the wise men and the sorcerers: now the
magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their
enchantments.</p>
<p>7:12 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:
but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.</p>
<p>7:13 And he hardened Pharaoh’s heart, that he hearkened not unto
them; as the LORD had said.</p>
<p>7:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, Pharaoh’s heart is hardened, he
refuseth to let the people go.</p>
<p>7:15 Get thee unto Pharaoh in the morning; lo, he goeth out unto the
water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink against he come; and
the rod which was turned to a serpent shalt thou take in thine hand.</p>
<p>7:16 And thou shalt say unto him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath
sent me unto thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in
the wilderness: and, behold, hitherto thou wouldest not hear.</p>
<p>7:17 Thus saith the LORD, In this thou shalt know that I am the LORD:
behold, I will smite with the rod that is in mine hand upon the waters
which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</p>
<p>7:18 And the fish that is in the river shall die, and the river shall
stink; and the Egyptians shall lothe to drink of the water of the
river.</p>
<p>7:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, Say unto Aaron, Take thy rod, and
stretch out thine hand upon the waters of Egypt, upon their streams,
upon their rivers, and upon their ponds, and upon all their pools of
water, that they may become blood; and that there may be blood
throughout all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood, and in
vessels of stone.</p>
<p>7:20 And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted
up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of
Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were
in the river were turned to blood.</p>
<p>7:21 And the fish that was in the river died; and the river stank,
and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there
was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>
<p>7:22 And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and
Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, neither did he hearken unto them; as the
LORD had said.</p>
<p>7:23 And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he set
his heart to this also.</p>
<p>7:24 And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</p>
<p>7:25 And seven days were fulfilled, after that the LORD had smitten
the river.</p>
