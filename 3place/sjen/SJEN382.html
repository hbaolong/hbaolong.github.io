约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 6章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>6:1 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
Israel: none went out, and none came in.</p>
<p>6:2 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.</p>
<p>6:3 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</p>
<p>6:4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
rams’ horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times,
and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</p>
<p>6:5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast with
the ram’s horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the
people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall
fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before
him.</p>
<p>6:6 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them,
Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven
trumpets of rams’ horns before the ark of the LORD.</p>
<p>6:7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and
let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.</p>
<p>6:8 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that
the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams’ horns passed on
before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant
of the LORD followed them.</p>
<p>6:9 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests going on, and
blowing with the trumpets.</p>
<p>6:10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout,
nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out
of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</p>
<p>6:11 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it once:
and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</p>
<p>6:12 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
the ark of the LORD.</p>
<p>6:13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams’ horns before
the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and
the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of
the LORD, the priests going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</p>
<p>6:14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
into the camp: so they did six days.</p>
<p>6:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same
manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven
times.</p>
<p>6:16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the LORD hath
given you the city.</p>
<p>6:17 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that
are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we
sent.</p>
<p>6:18 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing,
and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</p>
<p>6:19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are
consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the treasury of the
LORD.</p>
<p>6:20 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and
the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so
that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him,
and they took the city.</p>
<p>6:21 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of
the sword.</p>
<p>6:22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
country, Go into the harlot’s house, and bring out thence the woman, and
all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</p>
<p>6:23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that
she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the
camp of Israel.</p>
<p>6:24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein:
only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron,
they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>6:25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father’s
household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel even unto
this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out
Jericho.</p>
<p>6:26 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man
before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall
lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest son
shall he set up the gates of it.</p>
<p>6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised throughout
all the country.</p>
