– 撒母耳记下(2 22:1 And David spake unto the LORD the words of this song
in the day that the LORD had delivered him out of the hand of all his
enemies, and out of the hand of Saul:</h4>
<p>22:2 And he said, The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my
deliverer;</p>
<p>22:3 The God of my rock; in him will I trust: he is my shield, and
the horn of my salvation, my high tower, and my refuge, my saviour; thou
savest me from violence.</p>
<p>22:4 I will call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I
be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p>22:5 When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid;</p>
<p>22:6 The sorrows of hell compassed me about; the snares of death
prevented me;</p>
<p>22:7 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried to my God: and
he did hear my voice out of his temple, and my cry did enter into his
ears.</p>
<p>22:8 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of heaven
moved and shook, because he was wroth.</p>
<p>22:9 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p>22:10 He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was
under his feet.</p>
<p>22:11 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: and he was seen upon
the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>22:12 And he made darkness pavilions round about him, dark waters,
and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p>22:13 Through the brightness before him were coals of fire
kindled.</p>
<p>22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven, and the most High uttered his
voice.</p>
<p>22:15 And he sent out arrows, and scattered them; lightning, and
discomfited them.</p>
<p>22:16 And the channels of the sea appeared, the foundations of the
world were discovered, at the rebuking of the LORD, at the blast of the
breath of his nostrils.</p>
<p>22:17 He sent from above, he took me; he drew me out of many
waters;</p>
<p>22:18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated
me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p>22:19 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
my stay.</p>
<p>22:20 He brought me forth also into a large place: he delivered me,
because he delighted in me.</p>
<p>22:21 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness: according
to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p>22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
departed from my God.</p>
<p>22:23 For all his judgments were before me: and as for his statutes,
I did not depart from them.</p>
<p>22:24 I was also upright before him, and have kept myself from mine
iniquity.</p>
<p>22:25 Therefore the LORD hath recompensed me according to my
righteousness; according to my cleanness in his eye sight.</p>
<p>22:26 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful, and with the
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright.</p>
<p>22:27 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself unsavoury.</p>
<p>22:28 And the afflicted people thou wilt save: but thine eyes are
upon the haughty, that thou mayest bring them down.</p>
<p>22:29 For thou art my lamp, O LORD: and the LORD will lighten my
darkness.</p>
<p>22:30 For by thee I have run through a troop: by my God have I leaped
over a wall.</p>
<p>22:31 As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the LORD is tried:
he is a buckler to all them that trust in him.</p>
<p>22:32 For who is God, save the LORD? and who is a rock, save our
God?</p>
<p>22:33 God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.</p>
<p>22:34 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet: and setteth me upon my high
places.</p>
<p>22:35 He teacheth my hands to war; so that a bow of steel is broken
by mine arms.</p>
<p>22:36 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p>22:37 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me; so that my feet did not
slip.</p>
<p>22:38 I have pursued mine enemies, and destroyed them; and turned not
again until I had consumed them.</p>
<p>22:39 And I have consumed them, and wounded them, that they could not
arise: yea, they are fallen under my feet.</p>
<p>22:40 For thou hast girded me with strength to battle: them that rose
up against me hast thou subdued under me.</p>
<p>22:41 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might
destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p>22:42 They looked, but there was none to save; even unto the LORD,
but he answered them not.</p>
<p>22:43 Then did I beat them as small as the dust of the earth, I did
stamp them as the mire of the street, and did spread them abroad.</p>
<p>22:44 Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of my people,
thou hast kept me to be head of the heathen: a people which I knew not
shall serve me.</p>
<p>22:45 Strangers shall submit themselves unto me: as soon as they
hear, they shall be obedient unto me.</p>
<p>22:46 Strangers shall fade away, and they shall be afraid out of
their close places.</p>
<p>22:47 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and exalted be the God
of the rock of my salvation.</p>
<p>22:48 It is God that avengeth me, and that bringeth down the people
under me,</p>
<p>22:49 And that bringeth me forth from mine enemies: thou also hast
lifted me up on high above them that rose up against me: thou hast
delivered me from the violent man.</p>
<p>22:50 Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
heathen, and I will sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p>22:51 He is the tower of salvation for his king: and sheweth mercy to
his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
