– 第 9章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>9:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the
first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of
Egypt, saying,</p>
<p>9:2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
appointed season.</p>
<p>9:3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in
his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and according to
all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.</p>
<p>9:4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should
keep the passover.</p>
<p>9:5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the LORD
commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
<p>9:6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of
a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came
before Moses and before Aaron on that day:</p>
<p>9:7 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a
man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of
the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel?</p>
<p>9:8 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the
LORD will command concerning you.</p>
<p>9:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>9:10 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or
of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a
journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</p>
<p>9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p>
<p>9:12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone
of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep
it.</p>
<p>9:13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off
from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD
in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p>
<p>9:14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and
according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one
ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the
land.</p>
<p>9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even
there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until
the morning.</p>
<p>9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance
of fire by night.</p>
<p>9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after
that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud
abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</p>
<p>9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,
and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud
abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</p>
<p>9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed
not.</p>
<p>9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their
tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</p>
<p>9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,
and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:
whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they
journeyed.</p>
<p>9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of
Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken
up, they journeyed.</p>
<p>9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at
the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the
LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
