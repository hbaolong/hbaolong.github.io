约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 5章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the
waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were
passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them
any more, because of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>5:2 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives,
and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</p>
<p>5:3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of
Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</p>
<p>5:4 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people
that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, died
in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</p>
<p>5:5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth
out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.</p>
<p>5:6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,
till all the people that were men of war, which came out of Egypt, were
consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the
LORD sware that he would not shew them the land, which the LORD sware
unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk
and honey.</p>
<p>5:7 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua
circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not
circumcised them by the way.</p>
<p>5:8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were
whole.</p>
<p>5:9 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is
called Gilgal unto this day.</p>
<p>5:10 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of
Jericho.</p>
<p>5:11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after
the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the selfsame
day.</p>
<p>5:12 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more;
but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</p>
<p>5:13 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted
up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him
with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said
unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries?</p>
<p>5:14 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I
now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and
said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</p>
<p>5:15 And the captain of the LORD’s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy
shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is holy. And
Joshua did so.</p>
