耶利米哀歌(Lamentations) – 第 4章 ( 本篇共有 5章 )</h4>
<p>4:1 How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed!
the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every
street.</p>
<p>4:2 The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they
esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</p>
<p>4:3 Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to
their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the
ostriches in the wilderness.</p>
<p>4:4 The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth
for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto
them.</p>
<p>4:5 They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they
that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</p>
<p>4:6 For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people
is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown
as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</p>
<p>4:7 Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk,
they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of
sapphire:</p>
<p>4:8 Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the
streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is
become like a stick.</p>
<p>4:9 They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be
slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the
fruits of the field.</p>
<p>4:10 The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children:
they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my
people.</p>
<p>4:11 The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his
fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the
foundations thereof.</p>
<p>4:12 The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world,
would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have
entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>4:13 For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests,
that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,</p>
<p>4:14 They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have
polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their
garments.</p>
<p>4:15 They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart,
touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the
heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.</p>
<p>4:16 The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard
them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not
the elders.</p>
<p>4:17 As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our
watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.</p>
<p>4:18 They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end
is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</p>
<p>4:19 Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they
pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>4:20 The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken
in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the
heathen.</p>
<p>4:21 Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the
land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be
drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</p>
<p>4:22 The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of
Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit
thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</p>
