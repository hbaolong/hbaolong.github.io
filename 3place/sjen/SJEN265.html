利未记(Leviticus) – 第 25章 ( 本篇共有 27章 )</h4>
<p>25:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,</p>
<p>25:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath
unto the LORD.</p>
<p>25:3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;</p>
<p>25:4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor
prune thy vineyard.</p>
<p>25:5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for it is a
year of rest unto the land.</p>
<p>25:6 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee, and
for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for
thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,</p>
<p>25:7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,
shall all the increase thereof be meat.</p>
<p>25:8 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be
unto thee forty and nine years.</p>
<p>25:9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the
tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make
the trumpet sound throughout all your land.</p>
<p>25:10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a
jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and
ye shall return every man unto his family.</p>
<p>25:11 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not
sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather the
grapes in it of thy vine undressed.</p>
<p>25:12 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
the increase thereof out of the field.</p>
<p>25:13 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
possession.</p>
<p>25:14 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:</p>
<p>25:15 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt
buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the
fruits he shall sell unto thee:</p>
<p>25:16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the
price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish
the price of it: for according to the number of the years of the fruits
doth he sell unto thee.</p>
<p>25:17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear
thy God:for I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p>25:18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and
do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.</p>
<p>25:19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill,
and dwell therein in safety.</p>
<p>25:20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?
behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:</p>
<p>25:21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and
it shall bring forth fruit for three years.</p>
<p>25:22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit
until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old
store.</p>
<p>25:23 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for
ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</p>
<p>25:24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
redemption for the land.</p>
<p>25:25 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he
redeem that which his brother sold.</p>
<p>25:26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
redeem it;</p>
<p>25:27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore
the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto
his possession.</p>
<p>25:28 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year
of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he shall return unto
his possession.</p>
<p>25:29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year
may he redeem it.</p>
<p>25:30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then
the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to
him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in
the jubile.</p>
<p>25:31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be
redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.</p>
<p>25:32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of
the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.</p>
<p>25:33 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of
jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession
among the children of Israel.</p>
<p>25:34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
for it is their perpetual possession.</p>
<p>25:35 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with
thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a stranger, or a
sojourner; that he may live with thee.</p>
<p>25:36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
thy brother may live with thee.</p>
<p>25:37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
victuals for increase.</p>
<p>25:38 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.</p>
<p>25:39 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:</p>
<p>25:40 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile:</p>
<p>25:41 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession
of his fathers shall he return.</p>
<p>25:42 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the land
of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.</p>
<p>25:43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
God.</p>
<p>25:44 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy
bondmen and bondmaids.</p>
<p>25:45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among
you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you,
which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.</p>
<p>25:46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children
after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be your bondmen
for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not
rule one over another with rigour.</p>
<p>25:47 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the
stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s
family:</p>
<p>25:48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his
brethren may redeem him:</p>
<p>25:49 Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or any
that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be
able, he may redeem himself.</p>
<p>25:50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that
he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price of his sale
shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an
hired servant shall it be with him.</p>
<p>25:51 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he shall
give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was
bought for.</p>
<p>25:52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile, then
he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him
again the price of his redemption.</p>
<p>25:53 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.</p>
<p>25:54 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.</p>
<p>25:55 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am the LORD
your God.</p>
