第 21章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>21:1 And he looked up, and saw the rich men casting their gifts into
the treasury.</p>
<p>21:2 And he saw also a certain poor widow casting in thither two
mites.</p>
<p>21:3 And he said, Of a truth I say unto you, that this poor widow
hath cast in more than they all:</p>
<p>21:4 For all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings
of God: but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she
had.</p>
<p>21:5 And as some spake of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly
stones and gifts, he said,</p>
<p>21:6 As for these things which ye behold, the days will come, in the
which there shall not be left one stone upon another, that shall not be
thrown down.</p>
<p>21:7 And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things
be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to
pass?</p>
<p>21:8 And he said, Take heed that ye be not deceived: for many shall
come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draweth near: go ye
not therefore after them.</p>
<p>21:9 But when ye shall hear of wars and commotions, be not terrified:
for these things must first come to pass; but the end is not by and
by.</p>
<p>21:10 Then said he unto them, Nation shall rise against nation, and
kingdom against kingdom:</p>
<p>21:11 And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines,
and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from
heaven.</p>
<p>21:12 But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you, and
persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues, and into prisons,
being brought before kings and rulers for my name’s sake.</p>
<p>21:13 And it shall turn to you for a testimony.</p>
<p>21:14 Settle it therefore in your hearts, not to meditate before what
ye shall answer:</p>
<p>21:15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your
adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.</p>
<p>21:16 And ye shall be betrayed both by parents, and brethren, and
kinsfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to
death.</p>
<p>21:17 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.</p>
<p>21:18 But there shall not an hair of your head perish.</p>
<p>21:19 In your patience possess ye your souls.</p>
<p>21:20 And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then
know that the desolation thereof is nigh.</p>
<p>21:21 Then let them which are in Judaea flee to the mountains; and
let them which are in the midst of it depart out; and let not them that
are in the countries enter thereinto.</p>
<p>21:22 For these be the days of vengeance, that all things which are
written may be fulfilled.</p>
<p>21:23 But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give
suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and
wrath upon this people.</p>
<p>21:24 And they shall fall by the edge of the sword, and shall be led
away captive into all nations: and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of
the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</p>
<p>21:25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in
the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the
sea and the waves roaring;</p>
<p>21:26 Men’s hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those
things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be
shaken.</p>
<p>21:27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with
power and great glory.</p>
<p>21:28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and
lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.</p>
<p>21:29 And he spake to them a parable; Behold the fig tree, and all
the trees;</p>
<p>21:30 When they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves
that summer is now nigh at hand.</p>
<p>21:31 So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye
that the kingdom of God is nigh at hand.</p>
<p>21:32 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away,
till all be fulfilled.</p>
<p>21:33 Heaven and earth shall pass away: but my words shall not pass
away.</p>
<p>21:34 And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be
overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life,
and so that day come upon you unawares.</p>
<p>21:35 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face
of the whole earth.</p>
<p>21:36 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted
worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand
before the Son of man.</p>
<p>21:37 And in the day time he was teaching in the temple; and at night
he went out, and abode in the mount that is called the mount of
Olives.</p>
<p>21:38 And all the people came early in the morning to him in the
temple, for to hear him.</p>
