第 15章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go
in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to
go in.</p>
<p>15:2 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger
sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</p>
<p>15:3 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</p>
<p>15:4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst
between two tails.</p>
<p>15:5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the
standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also
the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</p>
<p>15:6 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken
his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up,
and burnt her and her father with fire.</p>
<p>15:7 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I
be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</p>
<p>15:8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</p>
<p>15:9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
themselves in Lehi.</p>
<p>15:10 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath
done to us.</p>
<p>15:11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are
rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said
unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</p>
<p>15:12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto
them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</p>
<p>15:13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill
thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the
rock.</p>
<p>15:14 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against
him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords
that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his
bands loosed from off his hands.</p>
<p>15:15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</p>
<p>15:16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</p>
<p>15:17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place
Ramathlehi.</p>
<p>15:18 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou
hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now
shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?</p>
<p>15:19 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there
came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and
he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in
Lehi unto this day.</p>
<p>15:20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
years.</p>
