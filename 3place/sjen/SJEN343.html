申命记(Deuteronomy) – 第 1章 ( 本篇共有 34章 )</h4>
<p>1:1 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side
Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between
Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</p>
<p>1:2 (There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of mount
Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)</p>
<p>1:3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,
on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto the children of
Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment
unto them;</p>
<p>1:4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in
Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in
Edrei:</p>
<p>1:5 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare
this law, saying,</p>
<p>1:6 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
long enough in this mount:</p>
<p>1:7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the
hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the
land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the
river Euphrates.</p>
<p>1:8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
to give unto them and to their seed after them.</p>
<p>1:9 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear
you myself alone:</p>
<p>1:10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are this
day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</p>
<p>1:11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many
more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</p>
<p>1:12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and
your strife?</p>
<p>1:13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</p>
<p>1:14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
is good for us to do.</p>
<p>1:15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over
hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and
officers among your tribes.</p>
<p>1:16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes
between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his
brother, and the stranger that is with him.</p>
<p>1:17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the
small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man;
for the judgment is God’s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring
it unto me, and I will hear it.</p>
<p>1:18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should
do.</p>
<p>1:19 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great
and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the
Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to
Kadeshbarnea.</p>
<p>1:20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</p>
<p>1:21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear
not, neither be discouraged.</p>
<p>1:22 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us
word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall
come.</p>
<p>1:23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
one of a tribe:</p>
<p>1:24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the
valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</p>
<p>1:25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a
good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</p>
<p>1:26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
commandment of the LORD your God:</p>
<p>1:27 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated
us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us
into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</p>
<p>1:28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,
saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great
and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the
Anakims there.</p>
<p>1:29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</p>
<p>1:30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for
you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</p>
<p>1:31 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD
thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye
went, until ye came into this place.</p>
<p>1:32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</p>
<p>1:33 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to
pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should
go, and in a cloud by day.</p>
<p>1:34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
sware, saying,</p>
<p>1:35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation
see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</p>
<p>1:36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him
will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children,
because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</p>
<p>1:37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou
also shalt not go in thither.</p>
<p>1:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall
go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit
it.</p>
<p>1:39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil,
they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall
possess it.</p>
<p>1:40 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</p>
<p>1:41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God
commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye
were ready to go up into the hill.</p>
<p>1:42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither
fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
enemies.</p>
<p>1:43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against
the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the
hill.</p>
<p>1:44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto
Hormah.</p>
<p>1:45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not
hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</p>
<p>1:46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
abode there.</p>
