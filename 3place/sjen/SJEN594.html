<p>2:59 And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,

and their seed, whether they were of Israel:</p>
<p>2:60 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of
Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.</p>
<p>2:61 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the

daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their
name:</p>
<p>2:62 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted,
put from the priesthood.</p>
<p>2:63 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with
Thummim.</p>
<p>2:64 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three
hundred and threescore,</p>
<p>2:65 Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were seven
thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were among them two
hundred singing men and singing women.</p>
<p>2:66 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules, two
hundred forty and five;</p>
<p>2:67 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six
thousand seven hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>2:68 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the
house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for the house of
God to set it up in his place:</p>
<p>2:69 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand pound of
silver, and one hundred priests’ garments.</p>
<p>2:70 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and the
singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in their cities, and
all Israel in their cities.</p>
