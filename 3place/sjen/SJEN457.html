– 撒母耳记下(2 1:1 Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when
David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had
abode two days in Ziklag;</h4>
<p>1:2 It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came
out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his
head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth,
and did obeisance.</p>
<p>1:3 And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said
unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.</p>
<p>1:4 And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell
me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many
of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son
are dead also.</p>
<p>1:5 And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou
that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?</p>
<p>1:6 And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance
upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the
chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.</p>
<p>1:7 And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And
I answered, Here am I.</p>
<p>1:8 And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an
Amalekite.</p>
<p>1:9 He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me:
for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.</p>
<p>1:10 So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he
could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was
upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought
them hither unto my lord.</p>
<p>1:11 Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise
all the men that were with him:</p>
<p>1:12 And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and
for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house
of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.</p>
<p>1:13 And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art
thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.</p>
<p>1:14 And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch
forth thine hand to destroy the LORD’s anointed?</p>
<p>1:15 And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and
fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.</p>
<p>1:16 And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy
mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD’s
anointed.</p>
<p>1:17 And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over
Jonathan his son:</p>
<p>1:18 (Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the
bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)</p>
<p>1:19 The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the
mighty fallen!</p>
<p>1:20 Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon;
lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
uncircumcised triumph.</p>
<p>1:21 Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there
be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the
mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not
been anointed with oil.</p>
<p>1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow
of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not
empty.</p>
<p>1:23 Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and
in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles,
they were stronger than lions.</p>
<p>1:24 Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in
scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your
apparel.</p>
<p>1:25 How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O
Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.</p>
<p>1:26 I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant
hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love
of women.</p>
<p>1:27 How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!</p>
