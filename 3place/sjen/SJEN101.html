第 3章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>3:1 There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the
Jews:</p>
<p>3:2 The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we
know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do these
miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</p>
<p>3:3 Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>3:4 Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old?
can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?</p>
<p>3:5 Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be
born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of
God.</p>
<p>3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born
of the Spirit is spirit.</p>
<p>3:7 Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.</p>
<p>3:8 The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so
is every one that is born of the Spirit.</p>
<p>3:9 Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things
be?</p>
<p>3:10 Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
and knowest not these things?</p>
<p>3:11 Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and
testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</p>
<p>3:12 If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how shall
ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?</p>
<p>3:13 And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down
from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.</p>
<p>3:14 And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up:</p>
<p>3:15 That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
eternal life.</p>
<p>3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,
that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting
life.</p>
<p>3:17 For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
but that the world through him might be saved.</p>
<p>3:18 He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth
not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of
the only begotten Son of God.</p>
<p>3:19 And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world,
and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were
evil.</p>
<p>3:20 For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh
to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</p>
<p>3:21 But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may
be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.</p>
<p>3:22 After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of
Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</p>
<p>3:23 And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because
there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</p>
<p>3:24 For John was not yet cast into prison.</p>
<p>3:25 Then there arose a question between some of John’s disciples and
the Jews about purifying.</p>
<p>3:26 And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold, the same
baptizeth, and all men come to him.</p>
<p>3:27 John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be
given him from heaven.</p>
<p>3:28 Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ,
but that I am sent before him.</p>
<p>3:29 He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the
bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of
the bridegroom’s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.</p>
<p>3:30 He must increase, but I must decrease.</p>
<p>3:31 He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth
is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh from heaven is
above all.</p>
<p>3:32 And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no man
receiveth his testimony.</p>
<p>3:33 He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that
God is true.</p>
<p>3:34 For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.</p>
<p>3:35 The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
hand.</p>
<p>3:36 He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he that
believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abideth
on him.</p>
