耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 38章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>38:1 Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of
Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah,
heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people,
saying,</p>
<p>38:2 Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by
the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth
to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and
shall live.</p>
<p>38:3 Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the
hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which shall take it.</p>
<p>38:4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let
this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of
war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in
speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of
this people, but the hurt.</p>
<p>38:5 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the
king is not he that can do any thing against you.</p>
<p>38:6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of
Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and
they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no
water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</p>
<p>38:7 Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was
in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon;
the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;</p>
<p>38:8 Ebedmelech went forth out of the king’s house, and spake to the
king, saying,</p>
<p>38:9 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have
done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and
he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for there is no
more bread in the city.</p>
<p>38:10 Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take
from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of
the dungeon, before he die.</p>
<p>38:11 So Ebedmelech took the men with him, and went into the house of
the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old
rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to
Jeremiah.</p>
<p>38:12 And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these
old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords.
And Jeremiah did so.</p>
<p>38:13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the
dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</p>
<p>38:14 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto
him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king
said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</p>
<p>38:15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee,
wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt
thou not hearken unto me?</p>
<p>38:16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As
the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death,
neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy
life.</p>
<p>38:17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God
of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the
king of Babylon’s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall
not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:</p>
<p>38:18 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes,
then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they
shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their
hand.</p>
<p>38:19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the
Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their
hand, and they mock me.</p>
<p>38:20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech
thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be
well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.</p>
<p>38:21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD
hath shewed me:</p>
<p>38:22 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s
house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those
women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed
against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away
back.</p>
<p>38:23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the
Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be
taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city
to be burned with fire.</p>
<p>38:24 Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these
words, and thou shalt not die.</p>
<p>38:25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they
come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast
said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to
death; also what the king said unto thee:</p>
<p>38:26 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication
before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s
house, to die there.</p>
<p>38:27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he
told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So
they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</p>
<p>38:28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that
Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.</p>
