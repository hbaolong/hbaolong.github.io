– 列王记上(1 18:1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of
the LORD came to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto
Ahab; and I will send rain upon the earth.</h4>
<p>18:2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sore
famine in Samaria.</p>
<p>18:3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.
(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly:</p>
<p>18:4 For it was so, when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the LORD,
that Obadiah took an hundred prophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave,
and fed them with bread and water.)</p>
<p>18:5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto all fountains
of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may find grass to save
the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all the beasts.</p>
<p>18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it:
Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by
himself.</p>
<p>18:7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and he
knew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lord
Elijah?</p>
<p>18:8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
here.</p>
<p>18:9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thy
servant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?</p>
<p>18:10 As the LORD thy God liveth, there is no nation or kingdom,
whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee: and when they said, He is
not there; he took an oath of the kingdom and nation, that they found
thee not.</p>
<p>18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is
here.</p>
<p>18:12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, that
the Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and so when
I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me: but I
thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.</p>
<p>18:13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the
prophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD’s prophets by
fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?</p>
<p>18:14 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here:
and he shall slay me.</p>
<p>18:15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I
stand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.</p>
<p>18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went to
meet Elijah.</p>
<p>18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto
him, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?</p>
<p>18:18 And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou, and thy
father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the LORD,
and thou hast followed Baalim.</p>
<p>18:19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mount
Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the
prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel’s table.</p>
<p>18:20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered the
prophets together unto mount Carmel.</p>
<p>18:21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt ye
between two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then
follow him. And the people answered him not a word.</p>
<p>18:22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a
prophet of the LORD; but Baal’s prophets are four hundred and fifty
men.</p>
<p>18:23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose
one bullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood,
and put no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it on
wood, and put no fire under:</p>
<p>18:24 And call ye on the name of your gods, and I will call on the
name of the LORD: and the God that answereth by fire, let him be God.
And all the people answered and said, It is well spoken.</p>
<p>18:25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one
bullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and call on
the name of your gods, but put no fire under.</p>
<p>18:26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they
dressed it, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,
saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any that answered.
And they leaped upon the altar which was made.</p>
<p>18:27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,
Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing, or
he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must be awaked.</p>
<p>18:28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner
with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.</p>
<p>18:29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesied
until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that there was
neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.</p>
<p>18:30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all
the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORD
that was broken down.</p>
<p>18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the
tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came,
saying, Israel shall be thy name:</p>
<p>18:32 And with the stones he built an altar in the name of the LORD:
and he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two
measures of seed.</p>
<p>18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces,
and laid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and
pour it on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.</p>
<p>18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the second
time. And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third
time.</p>
<p>18:35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled the
trench also with water.</p>
<p>18:36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening
sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of
Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou art
God in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done all these
things at thy word.</p>
<p>18:37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thou
art the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.</p>
<p>18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burnt
sacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked up the
water that was in the trench.</p>
<p>18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: and
they said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.</p>
<p>18:40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let not
one of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them down to
the brook Kishon, and slew them there.</p>
<p>18:41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for
there is a sound of abundance of rain.</p>
<p>18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the
top of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put his face
between his knees,</p>
<p>18:43 And said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he
went up, and looked, and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again
seven times.</p>
<p>18:44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,
there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man’s hand. And he
said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down, that
the rain stop thee not.</p>
<p>18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was
black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode,
and went to Jezreel.</p>
<p>18:46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up his
loins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.</p>
