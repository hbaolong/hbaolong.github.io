<p>7:1 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all the
instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels thereof, and had
anointed them, and sanctified them;</p>

who were the princes of the tribes, and were over them that were
numbered, offered:</p>
<p>7:3 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered
wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and for each
one an ox: and they brought them before the tabernacle.</p>
<p>7:4 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>7:5 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the
tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto the
Levites, to every man according to his service.</p>
