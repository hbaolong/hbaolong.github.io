– 帖撒罗尼迦前书(1 2:1 For yourselves, brethren, know our entrance in
unto you, that it was not in vain:</h4>
<p>2:2 But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully
entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak
unto you the gospel of God with much contention.</p>
<p>2:3 For our exhortation was not of deceit, nor of uncleanness, nor in
guile:</p>
<p>2:4 But as we were allowed of God to be put in trust with the gospel,
even so we speak; not as pleasing men, but God, which trieth our
hearts.</p>
<p>2:5 For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor
a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:</p>
<p>2:6 Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others,
when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ.</p>
<p>2:7 But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her
children:</p>
<p>2:8 So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have
imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls,
because ye were dear unto us.</p>
<p>2:9 For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring
night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we
preached unto you the gospel of God.</p>
<p>2:10 Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and
unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:</p>
<p>2:11 As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one
of you, as a father doth his children,</p>
<p>2:12 That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his
kingdom and glory.</p>
<p>2:13 For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when
ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as
the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which
effectually worketh also in you that believe.</p>
<p>2:14 For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which
in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of
your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:</p>
<p>2:15 Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have
persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:</p>
<p>2:16 Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved,
to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the
uttermost.</p>
<p>2:17 But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in
presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face
with great desire.</p>
<p>2:18 Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and
again; but Satan hindered us.</p>
<p>2:19 For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not
even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?</p>
<p>2:20 For ye are our glory and joy.</p>
