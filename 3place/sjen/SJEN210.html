利未记(Leviticus) – 第 20章 ( 本篇共有 27章 )</h4>
<p>20:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>20:2 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be
of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel,
that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to
death: the people of the land shall stone him with stones.</p>
<p>20:3 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to
defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.</p>
<p>20:4 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not:</p>
<p>20:5 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to
commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.</p>
<p>20:6 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face
against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.</p>
<p>20:7 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the LORD
your God.</p>
<p>20:8 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD which
sanctify you.</p>
<p>20:9 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother; his blood
shall be upon him.</p>
<p>20:10 And the man that committeth adultery with another man’s wife,
even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the
adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p>20:11 And the man that lieth with his father’s wife hath uncovered
his father’s nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to death; their
blood shall be upon them.</p>
<p>20:12 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their blood shall
be upon them.</p>
<p>20:13 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to
death; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
<p>20:14 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness: they
shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness
among you.</p>
<p>20:15 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death:
and ye shall slay the beast.</p>
<p>20:16 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be put to
death; their blood shall be upon them.</p>
<p>20:17 And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or
his mother’s daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness;
it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their
people: he hath uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his
iniquity.</p>
<p>20:18 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she
hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of them shall be cut
off from among their people.</p>
<p>20:19 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s
sister, nor of thy father’s sister: for he uncovereth his near kin: they
shall bear their iniquity.</p>
<p>20:20 And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he hath uncovered
his uncle’s nakedness: they shall bear their sin; they shall die
childless.</p>
<p>20:21 And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean
thing: he hath uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be
childless.</p>
<p>20:22 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell therein, spue
you not out.</p>
<p>20:23 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore
I abhorred them.</p>
<p>20:24 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and
honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated you from other
people.</p>
<p>20:25 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not make your
souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing
that creepeth on the ground, which I have separated from you as
unclean.</p>
<p>20:26 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.</p>
<p>20:27 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them with stones:
their blood shall be upon them.</p>
