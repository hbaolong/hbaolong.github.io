– 列王记上(1 6:1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth
year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in
the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which
is the second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.</h4>
<p>6:2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the length
thereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,
and the height thereof thirty cubits.</p>
<p>6:3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits was
the length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and ten
cubits was the breadth thereof before the house.</p>
<p>6:4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.</p>
<p>6:5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,
against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of
the oracle: and he made chambers round about:</p>
<p>6:6 The nethermost chamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was
six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in
the wall of the house he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams
should not be fastened in the walls of the house.</p>
<p>6:7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone made
ready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammer
nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was in
building.</p>
<p>6:8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of the
house: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber, and
out of the middle into the third.</p>
<p>6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house
with beams and boards of cedar.</p>
<p>6:10 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubits
high: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.</p>
<p>6:11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying,</p>
<p>6:12 Concerning this house which thou art in building, if thou wilt
walk in my statutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my
commandments to walk in them; then will I perform my word with thee,
which I spake unto David thy father:</p>
<p>6:13 And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will not
forsake my people Israel.</p>
<p>6:14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</p>
<p>6:15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,
both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and he
covered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of the house
with planks of fir.</p>
<p>6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both the
floor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for it
within, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.</p>
<p>6:17 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits
long.</p>
<p>6:18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and open
flowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.</p>
<p>6:19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there the
ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p>6:20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, and
twenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: and
he overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was of
cedar.</p>
<p>6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he made
a partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaid it
with gold.</p>
<p>6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished
all the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaid
with gold.</p>
<p>6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, each
ten cubits high.</p>
<p>6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubits
the other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wing
unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.</p>
<p>6:25 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were of
one measure and one size.</p>
<p>6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of
the other cherub.</p>
<p>6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and they
stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one
touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other
wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.</p>
<p>6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.</p>
<p>6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved
figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and
without.</p>
<p>6:30 And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and
without.</p>
<p>6:31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:
the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.</p>
<p>6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon them
carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaid them
with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palm
trees.</p>
<p>6:33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree,
a fourth part of the wall.</p>
<p>6:34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the one
door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were
folding.</p>
<p>6:35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:
and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.</p>
<p>6:36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, and
a row of cedar beams.</p>
<p>6:37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORD
laid, in the month Zif:</p>
<p>6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth
month, was the house finished throughout all the parts thereof, and
according to all the fashion of it. So was he seven years in building
it.</p>
