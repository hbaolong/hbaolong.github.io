以斯帖记(Esther) – 第 3章 ( 本篇共有 10章 )</h4>
<p>3:1 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the
princes that were with him.</p>
<p>3:2 And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed,
and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But
Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.</p>
<p>3:3 Then the king’s servants, which were in the king’s gate, said
unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king’s commandment?</p>
<p>3:4 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s
matters would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</p>
<p>3:5 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.</p>
<p>3:6 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had
shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought to destroy all
the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the
people of Mordecai.</p>
<p>3:7 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year
of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from
day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the
month Adar.</p>
<p>3:8 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of
thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all people; neither keep
they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to
suffer them.</p>
<p>3:9 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of
those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s
treasuries.</p>
<p>3:10 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto Haman
the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.</p>
<p>3:11 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</p>
<p>3:12 Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the
first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had
commanded unto the king’s lieutenants, and to the governors that were
over every province, and to the rulers of every people of every province
according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their
language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with
the king’s ring.</p>
<p>3:13 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s
provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both
young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the
thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to
take the spoil of them for a prey.</p>
<p>3:14 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
province was published unto all people, that they should be ready
against that day.</p>
<p>3:15 The posts went out, being hastened by the king’s commandment,
and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman
sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</p>
