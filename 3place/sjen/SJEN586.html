– 历代记下(2 30:1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote
letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house
of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the LORD God of
Israel.</h4>
<p>30:2 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.</p>
<p>30:3 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests had
not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the people gathered
themselves together to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>30:4 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.</p>
<p>30:5 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all
Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the
passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem: for they had not done
it of a long time in such sort as it was written.</p>
<p>30:6 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his princes
throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the
king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn again unto the LORD God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the remnant of you,
that are escaped out of the hand of the kings of Assyria.</p>
<p>30:7 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who therefore gave
them up to desolation, as ye see.</p>
<p>30:8 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which he hath
sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that the fierceness of
his wrath may turn away from you.</p>
<p>30:9 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
children shall find compassion before them that lead them captive, so
that they shall come again into this land: for the LORD your God is
gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if ye
return unto him.</p>
<p>30:10 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them to scorn,
and mocked them.</p>
<p>30:11 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>30:12 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of the
LORD.</p>
<p>30:13 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.</p>
<p>30:14 And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem,
and all the altars for incense took they away, and cast them into the
brook Kidron.</p>
<p>30:15 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and
sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings into the house
of the LORD.</p>
<p>30:16 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the blood, which
they received of the hand of the Levites.</p>
<p>30:17 For there were many in the congregation that were not
sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the killing of the
passovers for every one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the
LORD.</p>
<p>30:18 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet did
they eat the passover otherwise than it was written. But Hezekiah prayed
for them, saying, The good LORD pardon every one</p>
<p>30:19 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his
fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the purification of the
sanctuary.</p>
<p>30:20 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</p>
<p>30:21 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness: and the
Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud
instruments unto the LORD.</p>
<p>30:22 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that taught
the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat throughout the feast
seven days, offering peace offerings, and making confession to the LORD
God of their fathers.</p>
<p>30:23 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
and they kept other seven days with gladness.</p>
<p>30:24 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes gave to the
congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep: and a great
number of priests sanctified themselves.</p>
<p>30:25 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the
strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah,
rejoiced.</p>
<p>30:26 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>30:27 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy dwelling
place, even unto heaven.</p>
