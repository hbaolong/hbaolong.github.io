31章 ( 本篇共有 42章 )</h4>
<p>31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a
maid?</p>
<p>31:2 For what portion of God is there from above? and what
inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p>
<p>31:3 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to
the workers of iniquity?</p>
<p>31:4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</p>
<p>31:5 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to
deceit;</p>
<p>31:6 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine
integrity.</p>
<p>31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</p>
<p>31:8 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be
rooted out.</p>
<p>31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
wait at my neighbour’s door;</p>
<p>31:10 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down
upon her.</p>
<p>31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
punished by the judges.</p>
<p>31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
out all mine increase.</p>
<p>31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
maidservant, when they contended with me;</p>
<p>31:14 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,
what shall I answer him?</p>
<p>31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
fashion us in the womb?</p>
<p>31:16 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
the eyes of the widow to fail;</p>
<p>31:17 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath
not eaten thereof;</p>
<p>31:18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father,
and I have guided her from my mother’s womb;)</p>
<p>31:19 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor
without covering;</p>
<p>31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed
with the fleece of my sheep;</p>
<p>31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw
my help in the gate:</p>
<p>31:22 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
broken from the bone.</p>
<p>31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
his highness I could not endure.</p>
<p>31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
Thou art my confidence;</p>
<p>31:25 If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine
hand had gotten much;</p>
<p>31:26 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
brightness;</p>
<p>31:27 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath
kissed my hand:</p>
<p>31:28 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I
should have denied the God that is above.</p>
<p>31:29 If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or
lifted up myself when evil found him:</p>
<p>31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to
his soul.</p>
<p>31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
flesh! we cannot be satisfied.</p>
<p>31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors
to the traveller.</p>
<p>31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity
in my bosom:</p>
<p>31:34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?</p>
<p>31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the
Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a
book.</p>
<p>31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown
to me.</p>
<p>31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
would I go near unto him.</p>
<p>31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof
complain;</p>
<p>31:39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have
caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</p>
<p>31:40 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of
barley. The words of Job are ended.</p>
