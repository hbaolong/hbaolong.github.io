第 4章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>4:1 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
LORD, when Ehud was dead.</p>
<p>4:2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt
in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>4:3 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine
hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the
children of Israel.</p>
<p>4:4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
Israel at that time.</p>
<p>4:5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for
judgment.</p>
<p>4:6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel
commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee
ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of
Zebulun?</p>
<p>4:7 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the captain
of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and I will deliver
him into thine hand.</p>
<p>4:8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go:
but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.</p>
<p>4:9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD
shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went
with Barak to Kedesh.</p>
<p>4:10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up
with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</p>
<p>4:11 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and
pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</p>
<p>4:12 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up
to mount Tabor.</p>
<p>4:13 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred
chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth
of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</p>
<p>4:14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out
before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men
after him.</p>
<p>4:15 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera
lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</p>
<p>4:16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the edge
of the sword; and there was not a man left.</p>
<p>4:17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of
Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</p>
<p>4:18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my
lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into
the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</p>
<p>4:19 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him
drink, and covered him.</p>
<p>4:20 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is there
any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</p>
<p>4:21 Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into
his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep and
weary. So he died.</p>
<p>4:22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,
and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest.
And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the nail
was in his temples.</p>
<p>4:23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
children of Israel.</p>
<p>4:24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed
against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king of
Canaan.</p>
