出埃及记(Exodus) – 第 40章 ( 本篇共有 40章 )</h4>
<p>40:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>40:2 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
<p>40:3 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
the ark with the vail.</p>
<p>40:4 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in the
candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.</p>
<p>40:5 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the
ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to the
tabernacle.</p>
<p>40:6 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.</p>
<p>40:7 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.</p>
<p>40:8 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
hanging at the court gate.</p>
<p>40:9 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and all the
vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.</p>
<p>40:10 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar most
holy.</p>
<p>40:11 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify
it.</p>
<p>40:12 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.</p>
<p>40:13 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the priest’s
office.</p>
<p>40:14 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:</p>
<p>40:15 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
that they may minister unto me in the priest’s office: for their
anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood throughout their
generations.</p>
<p>40:16 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
so did he.</p>
<p>40:17 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.</p>
<p>40:18 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof, and reared
up his pillars.</p>
<p>40:19 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p>40:20 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:</p>
<p>40:21 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the vail
of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as the LORD
commanded Moses.</p>
<p>40:22 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.</p>
<p>40:23 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
LORD had commanded Moses.</p>
<p>40:24 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p>
<p>40:25 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
<p>40:26 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
before the vail:</p>
<p>40:27 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
<p>40:28 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>40:29 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the
burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p>40:30 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.</p>
<p>40:31 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
feet thereat:</p>
<p>40:32 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they
came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p>40:33 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses finished the
work.</p>
<p>40:34 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.</p>
<p>40:35 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory of the LORD
filled the tabernacle.</p>
<p>40:36 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:</p>
<p>40:37 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
till the day that it was taken up.</p>
<p>40:38 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,
throughout all their journeys.</p>
