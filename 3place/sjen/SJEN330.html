– 第 24章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>24:1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he
went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his
face toward the wilderness.</p>
<p>24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his
tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon
him.</p>
<p>24:3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
<p>24:4 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision
of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>
<p>24:5 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O
Israel!</p>
<p>24:6 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s
side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as
cedar trees beside the waters.</p>
<p>24:7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall
be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his
kingdom shall be exalted.</p>
<p>24:8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and
shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.</p>
<p>24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who
shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he
that curseth thee.</p>
<p>24:10 And Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine
enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three
times.</p>
<p>24:11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee
unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from
honour.</p>
<p>24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
which thou sentest unto me, saying,</p>
<p>24:13 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad
of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak?</p>
<p>24:14 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I
will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the
latter days.</p>
<p>24:15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:</p>
<p>24:16 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the
knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty,
falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:</p>
<p>24:17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh:
there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of
Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the
children of Sheth.</p>
<p>24:18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession
for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.</p>
<p>24:19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
destroy him that remaineth of the city.</p>
<p>24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that he
perish for ever.</p>
<p>24:21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and
said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a
rock.</p>
<p>24:22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
carry thee away captive.</p>
<p>24:23 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when
God doeth this!</p>
<p>24:24 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall
afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for
ever.</p>
<p>24:25 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
Balak also went his way.</p>
