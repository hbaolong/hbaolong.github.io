以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 22章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>22:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>22:2 Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the
bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.</p>
<p>22:3 Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood
in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against
herself to defile herself.</p>
<p>22:4 Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and
hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast
caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years:
therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to
all countries.</p>
<p>22:5 Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock
thee, which art infamous and much vexed.</p>
<p>22:6 Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their
power to shed blood.</p>
<p>22:7 In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst
of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have
they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</p>
<p>22:8 Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my
sabbaths.</p>
<p>22:9 In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they
eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.</p>
<p>22:10 In thee have they discovered their fathers’ nakedness: in thee
have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</p>
<p>22:11 And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife;
and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee
hath humbled his sister, his father’s daughter.</p>
<p>22:12 In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken
usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by
extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>22:13 Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest
gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst
of thee.</p>
<p>22:14 Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the
days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do
it.</p>
<p>22:15 And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in
the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.</p>
<p>22:16 And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight
of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>22:17 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>22:18 Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they
are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace;
they are even the dross of silver.</p>
<p>22:19 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become
dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>22:20 As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin,
into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so
will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you
there, and melt you.</p>
<p>22:21 Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my
wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.</p>
<p>22:22 As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be
melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have
poured out my fury upon you.</p>
<p>22:23 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>22:24 Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not
cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</p>
<p>22:25 There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof,
like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they
have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many
widows in the midst thereof.</p>
<p>22:26 Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy
things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane,
neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean,
and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among
them.</p>
<p>22:27 Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the
prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.</p>
<p>22:28 And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter,
seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord
GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.</p>
<p>22:29 The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised
robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the
stranger wrongfully.</p>
<p>22:30 And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the
hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not
destroy it: but I found none.</p>
<p>22:31 Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have
consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I
recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
