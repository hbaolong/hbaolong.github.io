第 28章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>28:1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was
called Melita.</p>
<p>28:2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they
kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain,
and because of the cold.</p>
<p>28:3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on
the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his
hand.</p>
<p>28:4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,
they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom,
though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</p>
<p>28:5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</p>
<p>28:6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down
dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm
come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</p>
<p>28:7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the
island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three
days courteously.</p>
<p>28:8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a
fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and
laid his hands on him, and healed him.</p>
<p>28:9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the
island, came, and were healed:</p>
<p>28:10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed,
they laded us with such things as were necessary.</p>
<p>28:11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,
which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</p>
<p>28:12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</p>
<p>28:13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and
after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to
Puteoli:</p>
<p>28:14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them
seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</p>
<p>28:15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to
meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul
saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</p>
<p>28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners
to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself
with a soldier that kept him.</p>
<p>28:17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the
chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said
unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the
people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from
Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</p>
<p>28:18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because
there was no cause of death in me.</p>
<p>28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal
unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</p>
<p>28:20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and
to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with
this chain.</p>
<p>28:21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of
Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or
spake any harm of thee.</p>
<p>28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as
concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</p>
<p>28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him
into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God,
persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out
of the prophets, from morning till evening.</p>
<p>28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some
believed not.</p>
<p>28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after
that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the
prophet unto our fathers,</p>
<p>28:26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear,
and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</p>
<p>28:27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are
dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see
with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their
heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p>28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is
sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</p>
<p>28:29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had
great reasoning among themselves.</p>
<p>28:30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and
received all that came in unto him,</p>
<p>28:31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which
concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding
him.</p>
