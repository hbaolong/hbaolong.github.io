第48章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>48:1 And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,
Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh
and Ephraim.</p>
<p>48:2 And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto
thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</p>
<p>48:3 And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz
in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p>
<p>48:4 And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and
multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will
give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</p>
<p>48:5 And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto
thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine;
as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</p>
<p>48:6 And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine,
and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their
inheritance.</p>
<p>48:7 And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the
land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come
unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is
Bethlehem.</p>
<p>48:8 And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons, and said, Who are these?</p>
<p>48:9 And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath
given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me,
and I will bless them.</p>
<p>48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not
see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced
them.</p>
<p>48:11 And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face:
and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</p>
<p>48:12 And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he
bowed himself with his face to the earth.</p>
<p>48:13 And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward
Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right
hand, and brought them near unto him.</p>
<p>48:14 And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon
Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s
head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</p>
<p>48:15 And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers
Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto
this day,</p>
<p>48:16 The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and
let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and
Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</p>
<p>48:17 And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon
the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father’s
hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.</p>
<p>48:18 And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is
the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</p>
<p>48:19 And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it:
he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his
younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a
multitude of nations.</p>
<p>48:20 And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel
bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set
Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>
<p>48:21 And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be
with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</p>
<p>48:22 Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,
which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my
bow.</p>
