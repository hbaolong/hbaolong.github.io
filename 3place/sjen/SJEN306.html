启示录(Revelation) – 第 21章 ( 本篇共有 22章 )</h4>
<p>21:1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and
the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.</p>
<p>21:2 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</p>
<p>21:3 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they
shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their
God.</p>
<p>21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</p>
<p>21:5 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and
faithful.</p>
<p>21:6 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the
fountain of the water of life freely.</p>
<p>21:7 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
God, and he shall be my son.</p>
<p>21:8 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all
liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and
brimstone: which is the second death.</p>
<p>21:9 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying,
Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.</p>
<p>21:10 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending
out of heaven from God,</p>
<p>21:11 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone
most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;</p>
<p>21:12 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the
gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of
the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:</p>
<p>21:13 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south
three gates; and on the west three gates.</p>
<p>21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them
the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</p>
<p>21:15 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.</p>
<p>21:16 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as
the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand
furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</p>
<p>21:17 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four
cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.</p>
<p>21:18 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
was pure gold, like unto clear glass.</p>
<p>21:19 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with
all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the
second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, an emerald;</p>
<p>21:20 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth, a
chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an amethyst.</p>
<p>21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was
of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were
transparent glass.</p>
<p>21:22 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
Lamb are the temple of it.</p>
<p>21:23 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the
light thereof.</p>
<p>21:24 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light
of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into
it.</p>
<p>21:25 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
shall be no night there.</p>
<p>21:26 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
it.</p>
<p>21:27 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie: but
they which are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</p>
