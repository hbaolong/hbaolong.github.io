– 撒母耳记下(2 21:1 Then there was a famine in the days of David three
years, year after year; and David enquired of the LORD. And the LORD
answered, It is for Saul, and for his bloody house, because he slew the
Gibeonites.</h4>
<p>21:2 And the king called the Gibeonites, and said unto them; (now the
Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the
Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn unto them: and Saul
sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and
Judah.)</p>
<p>21:3 Wherefore David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for
you? and wherewith shall I make the atonement, that ye may bless the
inheritance of the LORD?</p>
<p>21:4 And the Gibeonites said unto him, We will have no silver nor
gold of Saul, nor of his house; neither for us shalt thou kill any man
in Israel. And he said, What ye shall say, that will I do for you.</p>
<p>21:5 And they answered the king, The man that consumed us, and that
devised against us that we should be destroyed from remaining in any of
the coasts of Israel,</p>
<p>21:6 Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang
them up unto the LORD in Gibeah of Saul, whom the LORD did choose. And
the king said, I will give them.</p>
<p>21:7 But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan the son of
Saul, because of the LORD’s oath that was between them, between David
and Jonathan the son of Saul.</p>
<p>21:8 But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah,
whom she bare unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of
Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of
Barzillai the Meholathite:</p>
<p>21:9 And he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they
hanged them in the hill before the LORD: and they fell all seven
together, and were put to death in the days of harvest, in the first
days, in the beginning of barley harvest.</p>
<p>21:10 And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water dropped
upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the air to
rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by night.</p>
<p>21:11 And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the
concubine of Saul, had done.</p>
<p>21:12 And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of
Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them
from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when
the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:</p>
<p>21:13 And he brought up from thence the bones of Saul and the bones
of Jonathan his son; and they gathered the bones of them that were
hanged.</p>
<p>21:14 And the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son buried they in the
country of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father: and
they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was
intreated for the land.</p>
<p>21:15 Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and
David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the
Philistines: and David waxed faint.</p>
<p>21:16 And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight
of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he
being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.</p>
<p>21:17 But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succoured him, and smote the
Philistine, and killed him. Then the men of David sware unto him,
saying, Thou shalt go no more out with us to battle, that thou quench
not the light of Israel.</p>
<p>21:18 And it came to pass after this, that there was again a battle
with the Philistines at Gob: then Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Saph,
which was of the sons of the giant.</p>
<p>21:19 And there was again a battle in Gob with the Philistines, where
Elhanan the son of Jaareoregim, a Bethlehemite, slew the brother of
Goliath the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s
beam.</p>
<p>21:20 And there was yet a battle in Gath, where was a man of great
stature, that had on every hand six fingers, and on every foot six toes,
four and twenty in number; and he also was born to the giant.</p>
<p>21:21 And when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimeah the
brother of David slew him.</p>
<p>21:22 These four were born to the giant in Gath, and fell by the hand
of David, and by the hand of his servants.</p>
