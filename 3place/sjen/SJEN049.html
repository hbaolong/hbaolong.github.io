第49章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>49:1 And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves
together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last
days.</p>
<p>49:2 Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and
hearken unto Israel your father.</p>
<p>49:3 Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my
strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:</p>
<p>49:4 Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up
to thy father’s bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.</p>
<p>49:5 Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in
their habitations.</p>
<p>49:6 O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly,
mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and
in their selfwill they digged down a wall.</p>
<p>49:7 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for
it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in
Israel.</p>
<p>49:8 Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand
shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s children shall bow
down before thee.</p>
<p>49:9 Judah is a lion’s whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone
up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall
rouse him up?</p>
<p>49:10 The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from
between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of
the people be.</p>
<p>49:11 Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass’s colt unto the
choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the
blood of grapes:</p>
<p>49:12 His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with
milk.</p>
<p>49:13 Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be
for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.</p>
<p>49:14 Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>
<p>49:15 And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was
pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto
tribute.</p>
<p>49:16 Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>
<p>49:17 Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that
biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>
<p>49:18 I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</p>
<p>49:19 Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the
last.</p>
<p>49:20 Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal
dainties.</p>
<p>49:21 Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</p>
<p>49:22 Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;
whose branches run over the wall:</p>
<p>49:23 The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated
him:</p>
<p>49:24 But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were
made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the
shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>
<p>49:25 Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the
Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings
of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the
womb:</p>
<p>49:26 The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings
of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they
shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that
was separate from his brethren.</p>
<p>49:27 Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour
the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>
<p>49:28 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that
their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to
his blessing he blessed them.</p>
<p>49:29 And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered
unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field
of Ephron the Hittite,</p>
<p>49:30 In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before
Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of
Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.</p>
<p>49:31 There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried
Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p>
<p>49:32 The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was
from the children of Heth.</p>
<p>49:33 And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he
gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was
gathered unto his people.</p>
