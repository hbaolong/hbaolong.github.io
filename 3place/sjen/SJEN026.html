第26章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>26:1 And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that
was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the
Philistines unto Gerar.</p>
<p>26:2 And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into
Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</p>
<p>26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless
thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries,
and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;</p>
<p>26:4 And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and
will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all
the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>
<p>26:5 Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my
commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>
<p>26:6 And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>
<p>26:7 And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She
is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the
men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to
look upon.</p>
<p>26:8 And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that
Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and,
behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</p>
<p>26:9 And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is
thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto
him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</p>
<p>26:10 And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of
the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest
have brought guiltiness upon us.</p>
<p>26:11 And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth
this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>
<p>26:12 Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an
hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</p>
<p>26:13 And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he
became very great:</p>
<p>26:14 For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and
great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</p>
<p>26:15 For all the wells which his father’s servants had digged in the
days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled
them with earth.</p>
<p>26:16 And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much
mightier than we.</p>
<p>26:17 And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley
of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p>
<p>26:18 And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had
digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had
stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after
the names by which his father had called them.</p>
<p>26:19 And Isaac’s servants digged in the valley, and found there a
well of springing water.</p>
<p>26:20 And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac’s herdmen,
saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek;
because they strove with him.</p>
<p>26:21 And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he
called the name of it Sitnah.</p>
<p>26:22 And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for
that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he
said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful
in the land.</p>
<p>26:23 And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</p>
<p>26:24 And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am
the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will
bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham’s sake.</p>
<p>26:25 And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the
LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac’s servants digged a
well.</p>
<p>26:26 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his
friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</p>
<p>26:27 And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye
hate me, and have sent me away from you?</p>
<p>26:28 And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:
and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and
thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</p>
<p>26:29 That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and
as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in
peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</p>
<p>26:30 And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</p>
<p>26:31 And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to
another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in
peace.</p>
<p>26:32 And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac’s servants came,
and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto
him, We have found water.</p>
<p>26:33 And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is
Beersheba unto this day.</p>
<p>26:34 And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the
daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the
Hittite:</p>
<p>26:35 Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>
