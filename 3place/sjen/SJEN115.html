第 16章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>16:1 These things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be
offended.</p>
<p>16:2 They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh,
that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</p>
<p>16:3 And these things will they do unto you, because they have not
known the Father, nor me.</p>
<p>16:4 But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come,
ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not
unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.</p>
<p>16:5 But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh
me, Whither goest thou?</p>
<p>16:6 But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath
filled your heart.</p>
<p>16:7 Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that
I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you;
but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</p>
<p>16:8 And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of
righteousness, and of judgment:</p>
<p>16:9 Of sin, because they believe not on me;</p>
<p>16:10 Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no
more;</p>
<p>16:11 Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.</p>
<p>16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
now.</p>
<p>16:13 Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide
you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to
come.</p>
<p>16:14 He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall
shew it unto you.</p>
<p>16:15 All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I,
that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</p>
<p>16:16 A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little
while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.</p>
<p>16:17 Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this
that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and
again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the
Father?</p>
<p>16:18 They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little
while? we cannot tell what he saith.</p>
<p>16:19 Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said
unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little
while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall
see me?</p>
<p>16:20 Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament,
but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow
shall be turned into joy.</p>
<p>16:21 A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is
come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no
more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.</p>
<p>16:22 And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and
your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.</p>
<p>16:23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say
unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it
you.</p>
<p>16:24 Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall
receive, that your joy may be full.</p>
<p>16:25 These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time
cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall
shew you plainly of the Father.</p>
<p>16:26 At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you,
that I will pray the Father for you:</p>
<p>16:27 For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me,
and have believed that I came out from God.</p>
<p>16:28 I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world:
again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.</p>
<p>16:29 His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and
speakest no proverb.</p>
<p>16:30 Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not
that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth
from God.</p>
<p>16:31 Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?</p>
<p>16:32 Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be
scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am
not alone, because the Father is with me.</p>
<p>16:33 These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have
peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I
have overcome the world.</p>
