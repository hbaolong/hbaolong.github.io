耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 3章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>3:1 They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and
become another man’s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that
land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many
lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>3:2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast
not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian
in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms
and with thy wickedness.</p>
<p>3:3 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been
no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore’s forehead, thou refusedst to be
ashamed.</p>
<p>3:4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the
guide of my youth?</p>
<p>3:5 Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end?
Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.</p>
<p>3:6 The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast
thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon
every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played
the harlot.</p>
<p>3:7 And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto
me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it.</p>
<p>3:8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce;
yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the
harlot also.</p>
<p>3:9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that
she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with
stocks.</p>
<p>3:10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not
turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>3:11 And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified
herself more than treacherous Judah.</p>
<p>3:12 Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return,
thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger
to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep
anger for ever.</p>
<p>3:13 Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers
under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the
LORD.</p>
<p>3:14 Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married
unto you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I
will bring you to Zion:</p>
<p>3:15 And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall
feed you with knowledge and understanding.</p>
<p>3:16 And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased
in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The
ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither
shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that
be done any more.</p>
<p>3:17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD;
and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD,
to Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of
their evil heart.</p>
<p>3:18 In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of
Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to the
land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.</p>
<p>3:19 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give
thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I
said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from
me.</p>
<p>3:20 Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so
have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the
LORD.</p>
<p>3:21 A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and
supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their
way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God.</p>
<p>3:22 Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your
backslidings. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our
God.</p>
<p>3:23 Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from
the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation
of Israel.</p>
<p>3:24 For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our
youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</p>
<p>3:25 We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we
have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth
even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our
God.</p>
