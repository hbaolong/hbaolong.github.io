第2章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>2:1 Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of
them.</p>
<p>2:2 And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and
he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</p>
<p>2:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that
in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</p>
<p>2:4 These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when
they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the
heavens,</p>
<p>2:5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and
every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused
it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the
ground.</p>
<p>2:6 But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole
face of the ground.</p>
<p>2:7 And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.</p>
<p>2:8 And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he
put the man whom he had formed.</p>
<p>2:9 And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that
is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in
the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>2:10 And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from
thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</p>
<p>2:11 The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the
whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</p>
<p>2:12 And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the
onyx stone.</p>
<p>2:13 And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that
compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</p>
<p>2:14 And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which
goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.</p>
<p>2:15 And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of
Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p>
<p>2:16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat:</p>
<p>2:17 But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely
die.</p>
<p>2:18 And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be
alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p>
<p>2:19 And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what
he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature,
that was the name thereof.</p>
<p>2:20 And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,
and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an
help meet for him.</p>
<p>2:21 And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he
slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
thereof;</p>
<p>2:22 And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a
woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>
<p>2:23 And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my
flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</p>
<p>2:24 Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall
cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</p>
<p>2:25 And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.</p>
