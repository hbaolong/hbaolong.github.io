马太福音(Matthew) – 第 12章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and
his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and
to eat.</p>
<p>12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</p>
<p>12:3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he
was an hungred, and they that were with him;</p>
<p>12:4 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the shewbread,
which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for them which were with
him, but only for the priests?</p>
<p>12:5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the
priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</p>
<p>12:6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
temple.</p>
<p>12:7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and
not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</p>
<p>12:8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</p>
<p>12:9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their
synagogue:</p>
<p>12:10 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that
they might accuse him.</p>
<p>12:11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will
he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</p>
<p>12:12 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
lawful to do well on the sabbath days.</p>
<p>12:13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</p>
<p>12:14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,
how they might destroy him.</p>
<p>12:15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</p>
<p>12:16 And charged them that they should not make him known:</p>
<p>12:17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
prophet, saying,</p>
<p>12:18 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my
soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew
judgment to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>12:19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
voice in the streets.</p>
<p>12:20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he
not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</p>
<p>12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</p>
<p>12:22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,
and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake
and saw.</p>
<p>12:23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son
of David?</p>
<p>12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth
not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</p>
<p>12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every
kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city
or house divided against itself shall not stand:</p>
<p>12:26 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how
shall then his kingdom stand?</p>
<p>12:27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children
cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</p>
<p>12:28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom
of God is come unto you.</p>
<p>12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil
his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil
his house.</p>
<p>12:30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not
with me scattereth abroad.</p>
<p>12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall
be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not
be forgiven unto men.</p>
<p>12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to
come.</p>
<p>12:33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the
tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his
fruit.</p>
<p>12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</p>
<p>12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth
good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth
evil things.</p>
<p>12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</p>
<p>12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou
shalt be condemned.</p>
<p>12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</p>
<p>12:39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to it,
but the sign of the prophet Jonas:</p>
<p>12:40 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale’s
belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the
heart of the earth.</p>
<p>12:41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas;
and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</p>
<p>12:42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts
of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than
Solomon is here.</p>
<p>12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</p>
<p>12:44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</p>
<p>12:45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more
wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last
state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto
this wicked generation.</p>
<p>12:46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</p>
<p>12:47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</p>
<p>12:48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
mother? and who are my brethren?</p>
<p>12:49 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said,
Behold my mother and my brethren!</p>
<p>12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in
heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</p>
