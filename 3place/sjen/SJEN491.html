– 列王记上(1 11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together
with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites;</h4>
<p>11:2 Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children
of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto
you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: Solomon
clave unto these in love.</p>
<p>11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred
concubines: and his wives turned away his heart.</p>
<p>11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turned
away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the
LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</p>
<p>11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,
and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</p>
<p>11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not
fully after the LORD, as did David his father.</p>
<p>11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the
abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for
Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt
incense and sacrificed unto their gods.</p>
<p>11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was
turned from the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him
twice,</p>
<p>11:10 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not
go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.</p>
<p>11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is done
of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I
have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will
give it to thy servant.</p>
<p>11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thy
father’s sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.</p>
<p>11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one
tribe to thy son for David my servant’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake
which I have chosen.</p>
<p>11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad the
Edomite: he was of the king’s seed in Edom.</p>
<p>11:15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the
captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten
every male in Edom;</p>
<p>11:16 (For six months did Joab remain there with all Israel, until he
had cut off every male in Edom:)</p>
<p>11:17 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s
servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.</p>
<p>11:18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they took
men with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh king of
Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him
land.</p>
<p>11:19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that
he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes
the queen.</p>
<p>11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom
Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s
household among the sons of Pharaoh.</p>
<p>11:21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his
fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to
Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.</p>
<p>11:22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,
that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered,
Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.</p>
<p>11:23 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of
Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:</p>
<p>11:24 And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band,
when David slew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt
therein, and reigned in Damascus.</p>
<p>11:25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,
beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, and reigned
over Syria.</p>
<p>11:26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,
Solomon’s servant, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even
he lifted up his hand against the king.</p>
<p>11:27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the
king: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of
David his father.</p>
<p>11:28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomon
seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all
the charge of the house of Joseph.</p>
<p>11:29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of
Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;
and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in
the field:</p>
<p>11:30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it
in twelve pieces:</p>
<p>11:31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith
the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the
hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribes to thee:</p>
<p>11:32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David’s sake, and
for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes
of Israel:)</p>
<p>11:33 Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped
Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites,
and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my
ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes
and my judgments, as did David his father.</p>
<p>11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but
I will make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant’s
sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:</p>
<p>11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand, and will
give it unto thee, even ten tribes.</p>
<p>11:36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servant
may have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have
chosen me to put my name there.</p>
<p>11:37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all
that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.</p>
<p>11:38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command
thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to
keep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that I
will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David,
and will give Israel unto thee.</p>
<p>11:39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for
ever.</p>
<p>11:40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,
and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until
the death of Solomon.</p>
<p>11:41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and
his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</p>
<p>11:42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel
was forty years.</p>
<p>11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city
of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
