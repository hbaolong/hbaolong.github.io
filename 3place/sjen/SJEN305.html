启示录(Revelation) – 第 20章 ( 本篇共有 22章 )</h4>
<p>20:1 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the
bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.</p>
<p>20:2 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,</p>
<p>20:3 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a
seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the
thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a
little season.</p>
<p>20:4 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the
witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped
the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their
foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a
thousand years.</p>
<p>20:5 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</p>
<p>20:6 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection:
on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God
and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</p>
<p>20:7 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
out of his prison,</p>
<p>20:8 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle:
the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.</p>
<p>20:9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the
camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from
God out of heaven, and devoured them.</p>
<p>20:10 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire
and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be
tormented day and night for ever and ever.</p>
<p>20:11 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no
place for them.</p>
<p>20:12 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of
life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in
the books, according to their works.</p>
<p>20:13 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged
every man according to their works.</p>
<p>20:14 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the
second death.</p>
<p>20:15 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was
cast into the lake of fire.</p>
