– 第 21章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought
against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.</p>
<p>21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy
their cities.</p>
<p>21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up
the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he
called the name of the place Hormah.</p>
<p>21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much
discouraged because of the way.</p>
<p>21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there
is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this
light bread.</p>
<p>21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit
the people; and much people of Israel died.</p>
<p>21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the
LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the
people.</p>
<p>21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set
it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is
bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</p>
<p>21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and
it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld
the serpent of brass, he lived.</p>
<p>21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in
Oboth.</p>
<p>21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the
wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.</p>
<p>21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of
Zared.</p>
<p>21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the
Amorites.</p>
<p>21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</p>
<p>21:15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling
of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</p>
<p>21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the
LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them
water.</p>
<p>21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
it:</p>
<p>21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the
wilderness they went to Mattanah:</p>
<p>21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</p>
<p>21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</p>
<p>21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
saying,</p>
<p>21:22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields,
or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but
we will go along by the king’s high way, until we be past thy
borders.</p>
<p>21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel
into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against
Israel.</p>
<p>21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for
the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</p>
<p>21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</p>
<p>21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who
had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out
of his hand, even unto Arnon.</p>
<p>21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</p>
<p>21:28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city
of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places
of Arnon.</p>
<p>21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto
Sihon king of the Amorites.</p>
<p>21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
Medeba.</p>
<p>21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</p>
<p>21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</p>
<p>21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the
battle at Edrei.</p>
<p>21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou
shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which
dwelt at Heshbon.</p>
<p>21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</p>
