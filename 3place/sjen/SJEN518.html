– 列王记下(2 16:1 In the seventeenth year of Pekah the son of Remaliah
Ahaz the son of Jotham king of Judah began to reign.</h4>
<p>16:2 Twenty years old was Ahaz when he began to reign, and reigned
sixteen years in Jerusalem, and did not that which was right in the
sight of the LORD his God, like David his father.</p>
<p>16:3 But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea, and made
his son to pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the
heathen, whom the LORD cast out from before the children of Israel.</p>
<p>16:4 And he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places, and on
the hills, and under every green tree.</p>
<p>16:5 Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of
Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could
not overcome him.</p>
<p>16:6 At that time Rezin king of Syria recovered Elath to Syria, and
drave the Jews from Elath: and the Syrians came to Elath, and dwelt
there unto this day.</p>
<p>16:7 So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria,
saying, I am thy servant and thy son: come up, and save me out of the
hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel,
which rise up against me.</p>
<p>16:8 And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of
the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house, and sent it for a
present to the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>16:9 And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him: for the king of
Assyria went up against Damascus, and took it, and carried the people of
it captive to Kir, and slew Rezin.</p>
<p>16:10 And king Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria, and saw an altar that was at Damascus: and king Ahaz sent to
Urijah the priest the fashion of the altar, and the pattern of it,
according to all the workmanship thereof.</p>
<p>16:11 And Urijah the priest built an altar according to all that king
Ahaz had sent from Damascus: so Urijah the priest made it against king
Ahaz came from Damascus.</p>
<p>16:12 And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the
altar: and the king approached to the altar, and offered thereon.</p>
<p>16:13 And he burnt his burnt offering and his meat offering, and
poured his drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of his peace
offerings, upon the altar.</p>
<p>16:14 And he brought also the brasen altar, which was before the
LORD, from the forefront of the house, from between the altar and the
house of the LORD, and put it on the north side of the altar.</p>
<p>16:15 And king Ahaz commanded Urijah the priest, saying, Upon the
great altar burn the morning burnt offering, and the evening meat
offering, and the king’s burnt sacrifice, and his meat offering, with
the burnt offering of all the people of the land, and their meat
offering, and their drink offerings; and sprinkle upon it all the blood
of the burnt offering, and all the blood of the sacrifice: and the
brasen altar shall be for me to enquire by.</p>
<p>16:16 Thus did Urijah the priest, according to all that king Ahaz
commanded.</p>
<p>16:17 And king Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases, and removed the
laver from off them; and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that
were under it, and put it upon a pavement of stones.</p>
<p>16:18 And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the
house, and the king’s entry without, turned he from the house of the
LORD for the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>16:19 Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>16:20 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David: and Hezekiah his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
