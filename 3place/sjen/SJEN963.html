耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 29章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>29:1 Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet
sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried
away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the
people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to
Babylon;</p>
<p>29:2 (After that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs,
the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths,
were departed from Jerusalem;)</p>
<p>29:3 By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son
of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to
Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,</p>
<p>29:4 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all that
are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from
Jerusalem unto Babylon;</p>
<p>29:5 Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat
the fruit of them;</p>
<p>29:6 Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for
your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons
and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished.</p>
<p>29:7 And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be
carried away captives, and pray unto the LORD for it: for in the peace
thereof shall ye have peace.</p>
<p>29:8 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not
your prophets and your diviners, that be in the midst of you, deceive
you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed.</p>
<p>29:9 For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent
them, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>29:10 For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years be
accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word
toward you, in causing you to return to this place.</p>
<p>29:11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith the
LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected
end.</p>
<p>29:12 Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me,
and I will hearken unto you.</p>
<p>29:13 And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me
with all your heart.</p>
<p>29:14 And I will be found of you, saith the LORD: and I will turn
away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and
from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD; and I
will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried
away captive.</p>
<p>29:15 Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised us up prophets in
Babylon;</p>
<p>29:16 Know that thus saith the LORD of the king that sitteth upon the
throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, and
of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;</p>
<p>29:17 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the
sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile
figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</p>
<p>29:18 And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and
with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the
kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and an
hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven
them:</p>
<p>29:19 Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD,
which I sent unto them by my servants the prophets, rising up early and
sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>29:20 Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the
captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:</p>
<p>29:21 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, of Ahab the
son of Kolaiah, and of Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, which prophesy a
lie unto you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your
eyes;</p>
<p>29:22 And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of
Judah which are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and
like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;</p>
<p>29:23 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have
committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken lying
words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a
witness, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>29:24 Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite,
saying,</p>
<p>29:25 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,
Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people that are
at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to
all the priests, saying,</p>
<p>29:26 The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the
priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every
man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put
him in prison, and in the stocks.</p>
<p>29:27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,
which maketh himself a prophet to you?</p>
<p>29:28 For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This
captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant
gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
<p>29:29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of
Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p>29:30 Then came the word of the LORD unto Jeremiah, saying,</p>
<p>29:31 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD
concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because that Shemaiah hath
prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a
lie:</p>
<p>29:32 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah
the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among
this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my
people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the
LORD.</p>
