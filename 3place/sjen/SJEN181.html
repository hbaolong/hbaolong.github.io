– 哥林多前书(1 11:1 Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of
Christ.</h4>
<p>11:2 Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things,
and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</p>
<p>11:3 But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ;
and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</p>
<p>11:4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered,
dishonoureth his head.</p>
<p>11:5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head
uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were
shaven.</p>
<p>11:6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if
it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</p>
<p>11:7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is
the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</p>
<p>11:8 For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</p>
<p>11:9 Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the
man.</p>
<p>11:10 For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head
because of the angels.</p>
<p>11:11 Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the
woman without the man, in the Lord.</p>
<p>11:12 For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the
woman; but all things of God.</p>
<p>11:13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God
uncovered?</p>
<p>11:14 Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long
hair, it is a shame unto him?</p>
<p>11:15 But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her
hair is given her for a covering.</p>
<p>11:16 But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom,
neither the churches of God.</p>
<p>11:17 Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye
come together not for the better, but for the worse.</p>
<p>11:18 For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear
that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</p>
<p>11:19 For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are
approved may be made manifest among you.</p>
<p>11:20 When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to
eat the Lord’s supper.</p>
<p>11:21 For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and
one is hungry, and another is drunken.</p>
<p>11:22 What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye
the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to
you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.</p>
<p>11:23 For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered
unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed
took bread:</p>
<p>11:24 And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat:
this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of
me.</p>
<p>11:25 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped,
saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as
ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</p>
<p>11:26 For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do
shew the Lord’s death till he come.</p>
<p>11:27 Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of
the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the
Lord.</p>
<p>11:28 But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that
bread, and drink of that cup.</p>
<p>11:29 For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh
damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.</p>
<p>11:30 For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many
sleep.</p>
<p>11:31 For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</p>
<p>11:32 But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we
should not be condemned with the world.</p>
<p>11:33 Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one
for another.</p>
<p>11:34 And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not
together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I
come.</p>
