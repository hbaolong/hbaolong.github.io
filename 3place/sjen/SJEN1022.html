以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 31章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>31:1 And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in
the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,</p>
<p>31:2 Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his
multitude; Whom art thou like in thy greatness?</p>
<p>31:3 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches,
and with a shadowing shroud, and of an high stature; and his top was
among the thick boughs.</p>
<p>31:4 The waters made him great, the deep set him up on high with her
rivers running round about his plants, and sent out her little rivers
unto all the trees of the field.</p>
<p>31:5 Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the
field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long
because of the multitude of waters, when he shot forth.</p>
<p>31:6 All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and
under his branches did all the beasts of the field bring forth their
young, and under his shadow dwelt all great nations.</p>
<p>31:7 Thus was he fair in his greatness, in the length of his
branches: for his root was by great waters.</p>
<p>31:8 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide him: the fir
trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his
branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his
beauty.</p>
<p>31:9 I have made him fair by the multitude of his branches: so that
all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.</p>
<p>31:10 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast lifted up
thyself in height, and he hath shot up his top among the thick boughs,
and his heart is lifted up in his height;</p>
<p>31:11 I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the mighty one
of the heathen; he shall surely deal with him: I have driven him out for
his wickedness.</p>
<p>31:12 And strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,
and have left him: upon the mountains and in all the valleys his
branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all the rivers of the
land; and all the people of the earth are gone down from his shadow, and
have left him.</p>
<p>31:13 Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all
the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:</p>
<p>31:14 To the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt
themselves for their height, neither shoot up their top among the thick
boughs, neither their trees stand up in their height, all that drink
water: for they are all delivered unto death, to the nether parts of the
earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to
the pit.</p>
<p>31:15 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the
grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained
the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused
Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for
him.</p>
<p>31:16 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I
cast him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the
trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon, all that drink water,
shall be comforted in the nether parts of the earth.</p>
<p>31:17 They also went down into hell with him unto them that be slain
with the sword; and they that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow
in the midst of the heathen.</p>
<p>31:18 To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the
trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden
unto the nether parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the
uncircumcised with them that be slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and
all his multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
