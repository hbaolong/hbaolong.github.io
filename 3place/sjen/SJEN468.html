– 撒母耳记下(2 12:1 And the LORD sent Nathan unto David. And he came
unto him, and said unto him, There were two men in one city; the one
rich, and the other poor.</h4>
<p>12:2 The rich man had exceeding many flocks and herds:</p>
<p>12:3 But the poor man had nothing, save one little ewe lamb, which he
had bought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him, and with
his children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup, and
lay in his bosom, and was unto him as a daughter.</p>
<p>12:4 And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and he spared to
take of his own flock and of his own herd, to dress for the wayfaring
man that was come unto him; but took the poor man’s lamb, and dressed it
for the man that was come to him.</p>
<p>12:5 And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he
said to Nathan, As the LORD liveth, the man that hath done this thing
shall surely die:</p>
<p>12:6 And he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this
thing, and because he had no pity.</p>
<p>12:7 And Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus saith the LORD
God of Israel, I anointed thee king over Israel, and I delivered thee
out of the hand of Saul;</p>
<p>12:8 And I gave thee thy master’s house, and thy master’s wives into
thy bosom, and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah; and if that
had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee such and such
things.</p>
<p>12:9 Wherefore hast thou despised the commandment of the LORD, to do
evil in his sight? thou hast killed Uriah the Hittite with the sword,
and hast taken his wife to be thy wife, and hast slain him with the
sword of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>12:10 Now therefore the sword shall never depart from thine house;
because thou hast despised me, and hast taken the wife of Uriah the
Hittite to be thy wife.</p>
<p>12:11 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against thee
out of thine own house, and I will take thy wives before thine eyes, and
give them unto thy neighbour, and he shall lie with thy wives in the
sight of this sun.</p>
<p>12:12 For thou didst it secretly: but I will do this thing before all
Israel, and before the sun.</p>
<p>12:13 And David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the LORD. And
Nathan said unto David, The LORD also hath put away thy sin; thou shalt
not die.</p>
<p>12:14 Howbeit, because by this deed thou hast given great occasion to
the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme, the child also that is born unto
thee shall surely die.</p>
<p>12:15 And Nathan departed unto his house. And the LORD struck the
child that Uriah’s wife bare unto David, and it was very sick.</p>
<p>12:16 David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted,
and went in, and lay all night upon the earth.</p>
<p>12:17 And the elders of his house arose, and went to him, to raise
him up from the earth: but he would not, neither did he eat bread with
them.</p>
<p>12:18 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that the child died.
And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead:
for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spake unto him,
and he would not hearken unto our voice: how will he then vex himself,
if we tell him that the child is dead?</p>
<p>12:19 But when David saw that his servants whispered, David perceived
that the child was dead: therefore David said unto his servants, Is the
child dead? And they said, He is dead.</p>
<p>12:20 Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed
himself, and changed his apparel, and came into the house of the LORD,
and worshipped: then he came to his own house; and when he required,
they set bread before him, and he did eat.</p>
<p>12:21 Then said his servants unto him, What thing is this that thou
hast done? thou didst fast and weep for the child, while it was alive;
but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.</p>
<p>12:22 And he said, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept:
for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will be gracious to me, that the
child may live?</p>
<p>12:23 But now he is dead, wherefore should I fast? can I bring him
back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</p>
<p>12:24 And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in unto her,
and lay with her: and she bare a son, and he called his name Solomon:
and the LORD loved him.</p>
<p>12:25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet; and he called
his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</p>
<p>12:26 And Joab fought against Rabbah of the children of Ammon, and
took the royal city.</p>
<p>12:27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought
against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.</p>
<p>12:28 Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and
encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be
called after my name.</p>
<p>12:29 And David gathered all the people together, and went to Rabbah,
and fought against it, and took it.</p>
<p>12:30 And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight
whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones: and it was set on
David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great
abundance.</p>
<p>12:31 And he brought forth the people that were therein, and put them
under saws, and under harrows of iron, and under axes of iron, and made
them pass through the brick-kiln: and thus did he unto all the cities of
the children of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto
Jerusalem.</p>
