第1章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>1:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>
<p>1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon
the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the
waters.</p>
<p>1:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>
<p>1:4 And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the
light from the darkness.</p>
<p>1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p>
<p>1:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the
waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</p>
<p>1:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were
under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and
it was so.</p>
<p>1:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the
morning were the second day.</p>
<p>1:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered
together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.</p>
<p>1:10 And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of
the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>1:11 And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in
itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</p>
<p>1:12 And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after
his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after
his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>1:13 And the evening and the morning were the third day.</p>
<p>1:14 And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven
to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for
seasons, and for days, and years:</p>
<p>1:15 And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to
give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>
<p>1:16 And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the
day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.</p>
<p>1:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth,</p>
<p>1:18 And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the
light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>1:19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</p>
<p>1:20 And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.</p>
<p>1:21 And God created great whales, and every living creature that
moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and
every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>1:22 And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and
fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.</p>
<p>1:23 And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</p>
<p>1:24 And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after
his kind: and it was so.</p>
<p>1:25 And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle
after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>
<p>1:26 And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl
of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</p>
<p>1:27 So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created
he him; male and female created he them.</p>
<p>1:28 And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and
multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over
the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living
thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>
<p>1:29 And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed,
which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is
the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</p>
<p>1:30 And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,
and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is life,
I have given every green herb for meat: and it was so.</p>
<p>1:31 And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was
very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</p>
