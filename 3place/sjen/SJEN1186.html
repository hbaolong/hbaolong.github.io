第 24章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>24:1 Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning,
they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had
prepared, and certain others with them.</p>
<p>24:2 And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</p>
<p>24:3 And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord
Jesus.</p>
<p>24:4 And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout,
behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</p>
<p>24:5 And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the
earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?</p>
<p>24:6 He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you
when he was yet in Galilee,</p>
<p>24:7 Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of
sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</p>
<p>24:8 And they remembered his words,</p>
<p>24:9 And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto
the eleven, and to all the rest.</p>
<p>24:10 It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of
James, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto
the apostles.</p>
<p>24:11 And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed
them not.</p>
<p>24:12 Then arose Peter, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping
down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed,
wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.</p>
<p>24:13 And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called
Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs.</p>
<p>24:14 And they talked together of all these things which had
happened.</p>
<p>24:15 And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and
reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</p>
<p>24:16 But their eyes were holden that they should not know him.</p>
<p>24:17 And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these
that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</p>
<p>24:18 And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said
unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the
things which are come to pass there in these days?</p>
<p>24:19 And he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him,
Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and
word before God and all the people:</p>
<p>24:20 And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be
condemned to death, and have crucified him.</p>
<p>24:21 But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed
Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things
were done.</p>
<p>24:22 Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished,
which were early at the sepulchre;</p>
<p>24:23 And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they
had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive.</p>
<p>24:24 And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre,
and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</p>
<p>24:25 Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe
all that the prophets have spoken:</p>
<p>24:26 Ought not Christ to have suffered these things, and to enter
into his glory?</p>
<p>24:27 And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto
them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>
<p>24:28 And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he
made as though he would have gone further.</p>
<p>24:29 But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is
toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with
them.</p>
<p>24:30 And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took
bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them.</p>
<p>24:31 And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished
out of their sight.</p>
<p>24:32 And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us,
while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the
scriptures?</p>
<p>24:33 And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and
found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</p>
<p>24:34 Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to
Simon.</p>
<p>24:35 And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was
known of them in breaking of bread.</p>
<p>24:36 And as they thus spake, Jesus himself stood in the midst of
them, and saith unto them, Peace be unto you.</p>
<p>24:37 But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they
had seen a spirit.</p>
<p>24:38 And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts
arise in your hearts?</p>
<p>24:39 Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me,
and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</p>
<p>24:40 And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his
feet.</p>
<p>24:41 And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said
unto them, Have ye here any meat?</p>
<p>24:42 And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an
honeycomb.</p>
<p>24:43 And he took it, and did eat before them.</p>
<p>24:44 And he said unto them, These are the words which I spake unto
you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which
were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the
psalms, concerning me.</p>
<p>24:45 Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand
the scriptures,</p>
<p>24:46 And said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</p>
<p>24:47 And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>24:48 And ye are witnesses of these things.</p>
<p>24:49 And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but
tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on
high.</p>
<p>24:50 And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his
hands, and blessed them.</p>
<p>24:51 And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from
them, and carried up into heaven.</p>
<p>24:52 And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great
joy:</p>
<p>24:53 And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.
Amen.</p>
