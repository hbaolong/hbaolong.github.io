第37章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>37:1 And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,
in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>37:2 These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen
years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with
the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives: and
Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.</p>
<p>37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he
was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.</p>
<p>37:4 And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than
all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto
him.</p>
<p>37:5 And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and
they hated him yet the more.</p>
<p>37:6 And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have
dreamed:</p>
<p>37:7 For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my
sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood
round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</p>
<p>37:8 And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?
or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the
more for his dreams, and for his words.</p>
<p>37:9 And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and
said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the
moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.</p>
<p>37:10 And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his
father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast
dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down
ourselves to thee to the earth?</p>
<p>37:11 And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the
saying.</p>
<p>37:12 And his brethren went to feed their father’s flock in
Shechem.</p>
<p>37:13 And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock
in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him,
Here am I.</p>
<p>37:14 And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well
with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So
he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</p>
<p>37:15 And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in
the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</p>
<p>37:16 And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where
they feed their flocks.</p>
<p>37:17 And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them
say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found
them in Dothan.</p>
<p>37:18 And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto
them, they conspired against him to slay him.</p>
<p>37:19 And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</p>
<p>37:20 Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some
pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall
see what will become of his dreams.</p>
<p>37:21 And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;
and said, Let us not kill him.</p>
<p>37:22 And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into
this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he
might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father
again.</p>
<p>37:23 And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,
that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that
was on him;</p>
<p>37:24 And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was
empty, there was no water in it.</p>
<p>37:25 And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes
and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with
their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down
to Egypt.</p>
<p>37:26 And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay
our brother, and conceal his blood?</p>
<p>37:27 Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our
hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren
were content.</p>
<p>37:28 Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and
lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for
twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.</p>
<p>37:29 And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not
in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</p>
<p>37:30 And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;
and I, whither shall I go?</p>
<p>37:31 And they took Joseph’s coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and
dipped the coat in the blood;</p>
<p>37:32 And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to
their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy
son’s coat or no.</p>
<p>37:33 And he knew it, and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast
hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</p>
<p>37:34 And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,
and mourned for his son many days.</p>
<p>37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;
but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the
grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.</p>
<p>37:36 And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an
officer of Pharaoh’s, and captain of the guard.</p>
