第35章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>35:1 And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell
there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto thee when
thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p>
<p>35:2 Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with
him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be clean, and
change your garments:</p>
<p>35:3 And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there an
altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and was with
me in the way which I went.</p>
<p>35:4 And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in
their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears; and Jacob
hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p>
<p>35:5 And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities
that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of
Jacob.</p>
<p>35:6 So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,
Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</p>
<p>35:7 And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:
because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the face of his
brother.</p>
<p>35:8 But Deborah Rebekah’s nurse died, and she was buried beneath
Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.</p>
<p>35:9 And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of
Padanaram, and blessed him.</p>
<p>35:10 And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not be
called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he called his
name Israel.</p>
<p>35:11 And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and
multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings
shall come out of thy loins;</p>
<p>35:12 And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will
give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>
<p>35:13 And God went up from him in the place where he talked with
him.</p>
<p>35:14 And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with
him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering thereon, and
he poured oil thereon.</p>
<p>35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with
him, Bethel.</p>
<p>35:16 And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way
to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.</p>
<p>35:17 And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the
midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.</p>
<p>35:18 And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she
died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called him
Benjamin.</p>
<p>35:19 And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is
Bethlehem.</p>
<p>35:20 And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of
Rachel’s grave unto this day.</p>
<p>35:21 And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of
Edar.</p>
<p>35:22 And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that
Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine: and Israel heard
it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>
<p>35:23 The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, and Simeon, and
Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</p>
<p>35:24 The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>
<p>35:25 And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid; Dan, and
Naphtali:</p>
<p>35:26 And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid; Gad, and Asher: these
are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.</p>
<p>35:27 And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city
of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>
<p>35:28 And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</p>
<p>35:29 And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto
his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and Jacob
buried him.</p>
