以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 41章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>41:1 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other
side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>41:2 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of the
door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other
side: and he measured the length thereof, forty cubits: and the breadth,
twenty cubits.</p>
<p>41:3 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven
cubits.</p>
<p>41:4 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto me, This is
the most holy place.</p>
<p>41:5 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the house on
every side.</p>
<p>41:6 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty
in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the house for the
side chambers round about, that they might have hold, but they had not
hold in the wall of the house.</p>
<p>41:7 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward to
the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went still upward
round about the house: therefore the breadth of the house was still
upward, and so increased from the lowest chamber to the highest by the
midst.</p>
<p>41:8 I saw also the height of the house round about: the foundations
of the side chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.</p>
<p>41:9 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the place of the
side chambers that were within.</p>
<p>41:10 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits
round about the house on every side.</p>
<p>41:11 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south:
and the breadth of the place that was left was five cubits round
about.</p>
<p>41:12 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building
was five cubits thick round about, and the length thereof ninety
cubits.</p>
<p>41:13 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the
separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an hundred
cubits long;</p>
<p>41:14 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
place toward the east, an hundred cubits.</p>
<p>41:15 And he measured the length of the building over against the
separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof on the one
side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with the inner temple,
and the porches of the court;</p>
<p>41:16 The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries round
about on their three stories, over against the door, cieled with wood
round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were
covered;</p>
<p>41:17 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and without,
and by all the wall round about within and without, by measure.</p>
<p>41:18 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had two
faces;</p>
<p>41:19 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one
side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the other
side: it was made through all the house round about.</p>
<p>41:20 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
trees made, and on the wall of the temple.</p>
<p>41:21 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the other.</p>
<p>41:22 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length thereof
two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the
walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto me, This is the table that
is before the LORD.</p>
<p>41:23 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.</p>
<p>41:24 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.</p>
<p>41:25 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there
were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.</p>
<p>41:26 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side
and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the side
chambers of the house, and thick planks.</p>
