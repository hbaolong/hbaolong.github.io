– 列王记下(2 24:1 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up,
and Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and
rebelled against him.</h4>
<p>24:2 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands
of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the children of
Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it, according to the word
of the LORD, which he spake by his servants the prophets.</p>
<p>24:3 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh, according to all
that he did;</p>
<p>24:4 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled
Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not pardon.</p>
<p>24:5 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah?</p>
<p>24:6 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>24:7 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto the river
Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.</p>
<p>24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he
reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother’s name was Nehushta,
the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>24:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
according to all that his father had done.</p>
<p>24:10 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.</p>
<p>24:11 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
his servants did besiege it.</p>
<p>24:12 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his princes, and his
officers: and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his
reign.</p>
<p>24:13 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of the
LORD, and the treasures of the king’s house, and cut in pieces all the
vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of
the LORD, as the LORD had said.</p>
<p>24:14 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and all
the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and all the
craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest sort of the people
of the land.</p>
<p>24:15 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king’s
mother, and the king’s wives, and his officers, and the mighty of the
land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.</p>
<p>24:16 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen
and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, even them
the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.</p>
<p>24:17 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father’s brother
king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.</p>
<p>24:18 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p>
<p>24:19 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</p>
<p>24:20 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
