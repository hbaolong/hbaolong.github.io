– 第 5章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>5:2 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever is defiled
by the dead:</p>
<p>5:3 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall ye
put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst whereof I
dwell.</p>
<p>5:4 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without the
camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of Israel.</p>
<p>5:5 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>5:6 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the LORD, and
that person be guilty;</p>
<p>5:7 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he
shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and add unto
it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him against whom he hath
trespassed.</p>
<p>5:8 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass unto,
let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to the priest;
beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an atonement shall be made for
him.</p>
<p>5:9 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.</p>
<p>5:10 And every man’s hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any man
giveth the priest, it shall be his.</p>
<p>5:11 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>5:12 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
man’s wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,</p>
<p>5:13 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes of
her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and there be no
witness against her, neither she be taken with the manner;</p>
<p>5:14 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of
his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy come upon
him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not defiled:</p>
<p>5:15 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall
bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal;
he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is an
offering of jealousy, an offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to
remembrance.</p>
<p>5:16 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
LORD:</p>
<p>5:17 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and
of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall
take, and put it into the water:</p>
<p>5:18 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and uncover
the woman’s head, and put the offering of memorial in her hands, which
is the jealousy offering: and the priest shall have in his hand the
bitter water that causeth the curse:</p>
<p>5:19 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone aside to
uncleanness with another instead of thy husband, be thou free from this
bitter water that causeth the curse:</p>
<p>5:20 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,
and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee beside thine
husband:</p>
<p>5:21 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing,
and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and
an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and
thy belly to swell;</p>
<p>5:22 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels,
to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall
say, Amen, amen.</p>
<p>5:23 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall
blot them out with the bitter water:</p>
<p>5:24 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall enter into
her, and become bitter.</p>
<p>5:25 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
woman’s hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and offer it
upon the altar:</p>
<p>5:26 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward shall cause
the woman to drink the water.</p>
<p>5:27 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come
to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her
husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and
become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and
the woman shall be a curse among her people.</p>
<p>5:28 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be
free, and shall conceive seed.</p>
<p>5:29 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to
another instead of her husband, and is defiled;</p>
<p>5:30 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the LORD, and the
priest shall execute upon her all this law.</p>
<p>5:31 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
shall bear her iniquity.</p>
