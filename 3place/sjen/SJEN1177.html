第 15章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 Then drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to
hear him.</p>
<p>15:2 And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man
receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.</p>
<p>15:3 And he spake this parable unto them, saying,</p>
<p>15:4 What man of you, having an hundred sheep, if he lose one of
them, doth not leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness, and go after
that which is lost, until he find it?</p>
<p>15:5 And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders,
rejoicing.</p>
<p>15:6 And when he cometh home, he calleth together his friends and
neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep
which was lost.</p>
<p>15:7 I say unto you, that likewise joy shall be in heaven over one
sinner that repenteth, more than over ninety and nine just persons,
which need no repentance.</p>
<p>15:8 Either what woman having ten pieces of silver, if she lose one
piece, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently
till she find it?</p>
<p>15:9 And when she hath found it, she calleth her friends and her
neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me; for I have found the piece
which I had lost.</p>
<p>15:10 Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the
angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</p>
<p>15:11 And he said, A certain man had two sons:</p>
<p>15:12 And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the
portion of goods that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his
living.</p>
<p>15:13 And not many days after the younger son gathered all together,
and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance
with riotous living.</p>
<p>15:14 And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that
land; and he began to be in want.</p>
<p>15:15 And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</p>
<p>15:16 And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the
swine did eat: and no man gave unto him.</p>
<p>15:17 And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants
of my father’s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with
hunger!</p>
<p>15:18 I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee,</p>
<p>15:19 And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of
thy hired servants.</p>
<p>15:20 And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell
on his neck, and kissed him.</p>
<p>15:21 And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy
son.</p>
<p>15:22 But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe,
and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his
feet:</p>
<p>15:23 And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat,
and be merry:</p>
<p>15:24 For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and
is found. And they began to be merry.</p>
<p>15:25 Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing.</p>
<p>15:26 And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things
meant.</p>
<p>15:27 And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound.</p>
<p>15:28 And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his
father out, and intreated him.</p>
<p>15:29 And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet
thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:</p>
<p>15:30 But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy
living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.</p>
<p>15:31 And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that
I have is thine.</p>
<p>15:32 It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this
thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is
found.</p>
