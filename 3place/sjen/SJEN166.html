利未记(Leviticus) – 第 16章 ( 本篇共有 27章 )</h4>
<p>16:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons of
Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;</p>
<p>16:2 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother, that
he come not at all times into the holy place within the vail before the
mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die not: for I will appear in
the cloud upon the mercy seat.</p>
<p>16:3 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock
for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.</p>
<p>16:4 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen
breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and
with the linen mitre shall he be attired: these are holy garments;
therefore shall he wash his flesh in water, and so put them on.</p>
<p>16:5 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of Israel
two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt
offering.</p>
<p>16:6 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his house.</p>
<p>16:7 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>16:8 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.</p>
<p>16:9 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD’s lot fell,
and offer him for a sin offering.</p>
<p>16:10 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with him, and
to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.</p>
<p>16:11 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which is
for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and for his house,
and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering which is for himself:</p>
<p>16:12 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet incense
beaten small, and bring it within the vail:</p>
<p>16:13 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is upon the
testimony, that he die not:</p>
<p>16:14 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it
with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the mercy seat
shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.</p>
<p>16:15 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with that blood
as he did with the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it upon the mercy
seat, and before the mercy seat:</p>
<p>16:16 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of
the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of their
transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for the tabernacle
of the congregation, that remaineth among them in the midst of their
uncleanness.</p>
<p>16:17 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the congregation
when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy place, until he come
out, and have made an atonement for himself, and for his household, and
for all the congregation of Israel.</p>
<p>16:18 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD, and
make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of the bullock,
and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the horns of the altar
round about.</p>
<p>16:19 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the uncleanness of the
children of Israel.</p>
<p>16:20 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place, and
the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he shall bring the
live goat:</p>
<p>16:21 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel,
and all their transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the
head of the goat, and shall send him away by the hand of a fit man into
the wilderness:</p>
<p>16:22 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the wilderness.</p>
<p>16:23 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into
the holy place, and shall leave them there:</p>
<p>16:24 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and
put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt offering, and
the burnt offering of the people, and make an atonement for himself, and
for the people.</p>
<p>16:25 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the
altar.</p>
<p>16:26 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into the
camp.</p>
<p>16:27 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the holy
place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they shall burn in
the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their dung.</p>
<p>16:28 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.</p>
<p>16:29 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your
souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your own country, or
a stranger that sojourneth among you:</p>
<p>16:30 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before the
LORD.</p>
<p>16:31 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
your souls, by a statute for ever.</p>
<p>16:32 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
consecrate to minister in the priest’s office in his father’s stead,
shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen clothes, even the
holy garments:</p>
<p>16:33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he
shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for
the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all
the people of the congregation.</p>
<p>16:34 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year. And
he did as the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
