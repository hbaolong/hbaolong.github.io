第32章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>32:1 And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>
<p>32:2 And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host: and he
called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>
<p>32:3 And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto
the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</p>
<p>32:4 And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord
Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban, and
stayed there until now:</p>
<p>32:5 And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and
womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in
thy sight.</p>
<p>32:6 And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy
brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four hundred men with
him.</p>
<p>32:7 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided the
people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and the camels,
into two bands;</p>
<p>32:8 And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then
the other company which is left shall escape.</p>
<p>32:9 And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father
Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy country, and to
thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</p>
<p>32:10 I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the
truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my staff I
passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two bands.</p>
<p>32:11 Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the
hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me, and the
mother with the children.</p>
<p>32:12 And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed
as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.</p>
<p>32:13 And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which
came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</p>
<p>32:14 Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,
and twenty rams,</p>
<p>32:15 Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten
bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</p>
<p>32:16 And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every
drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over before me,
and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</p>
<p>32:17 And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother
meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither goest
thou? and whose are these before thee?</p>
<p>32:18 Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob’s; it is a
present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind us.</p>
<p>32:19 And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that
followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau,
when ye find him.</p>
<p>32:20 And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.
For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth before me,
and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept of
me.</p>
<p>32:21 So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that
night in the company.</p>
<p>32:22 And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two
womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford Jabbok.</p>
<p>32:23 And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over
that he had.</p>
<p>32:24 And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him
until the breaking of the day.</p>
<p>32:25 And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched
the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was out of
joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>
<p>32:26 And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I
will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>
<p>32:27 And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>
<p>32:28 And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but
Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast
prevailed.</p>
<p>32:29 And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.
And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name? And he
blessed him there.</p>
<p>32:30 And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen
God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>
<p>32:31 And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he
halted upon his thigh.</p>
<p>32:32 Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which
shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day: because he
touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.</p>
