申命记(Deuteronomy) – 第 32章 ( 本篇共有 34章 )</h4>
<p>32:1 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
words of my mouth.</p>
<p>32:2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon
the grass:</p>
<p>32:3 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye
greatness unto our God.</p>
<p>32:4 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he.</p>
<p>32:5 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.</p>
<p>32:6 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not
he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
established thee?</p>
<p>32:7 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many
generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they
will tell thee.</p>
<p>32:8 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people
according to the number of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>32:9 For the LORD’s portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
inheritance.</p>
<p>32:10 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the
apple of his eye.</p>
<p>32:11 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings:</p>
<p>32:12 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
with him.</p>
<p>32:13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might
eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the
rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</p>
<p>32:14 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and
thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</p>
<p>32:15 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou
art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God
which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</p>
<p>32:16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
abominations provoked they him to anger.</p>
<p>32:17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew
not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</p>
<p>32:18 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
forgotten God that formed thee.</p>
<p>32:19 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</p>
<p>32:20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in
whom is no faith.</p>
<p>32:21 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they
have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to
jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger
with a foolish nation.</p>
<p>32:22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on
fire the foundations of the mountains.</p>
<p>32:23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
them.</p>
<p>32:24 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts
upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</p>
<p>32:25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray
hairs.</p>
<p>32:26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
remembrance of them to cease from among men:</p>
<p>32:27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should
say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this.</p>
<p>32:28 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
understanding in them.</p>
<p>32:29 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
would consider their latter end!</p>
<p>32:30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them
up?</p>
<p>32:31 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
being judges.</p>
<p>32:32 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
bitter:</p>
<p>32:33 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
asps.</p>
<p>32:34 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
treasures?</p>
<p>32:35 To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall
slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the
things that shall come upon them make haste.</p>
<p>32:36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut
up, or left.</p>
<p>32:37 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they
trusted,</p>
<p>32:38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your
protection.</p>
<p>32:39 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that
can deliver out of my hand.</p>
<p>32:40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</p>
<p>32:41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them
that hate me.</p>
<p>32:42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives,
from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</p>
<p>32:43 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and
will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.</p>
<p>32:44 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears
of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</p>
<p>32:45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
Israel:</p>
<p>32:46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which
I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to
observe to do, all the words of this law.</p>
<p>32:47 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither
ye go over Jordan to possess it.</p>
<p>32:48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</p>
<p>32:49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and behold the
land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a
possession:</p>
<p>32:50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was
gathered unto his people:</p>
<p>32:51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye
sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>32:52 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</p>
