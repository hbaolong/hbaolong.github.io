第 21章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>21:1 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and
had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day
following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:</p>
<p>21:2 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard,
and set forth.</p>
<p>21:3 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,
and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to
unlade her burden.</p>
<p>21:4 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to
Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went
our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children,
till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and
prayed.</p>
<p>21:6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship;
and they returned home again.</p>
<p>21:7 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to
Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</p>
<p>21:8 And the next day we that were of Paul’s company departed, and
came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the
evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.</p>
<p>21:9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did
prophesy.</p>
<p>21:10 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea
a certain prophet, named Agabus.</p>
<p>21:11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle, and bound
his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall
the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall
deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</p>
<p>21:12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that
place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine
heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem
for the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>21:14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will
of the Lord be done.</p>
<p>21:15 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:16 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,
and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom
we should lodge.</p>
<p>21:17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us
gladly.</p>
<p>21:18 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all
the elders were present.</p>
<p>21:19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what
things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</p>
<p>21:20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto
him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which
believe; and they are all zealous of the law:</p>
<p>21:21 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews
which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought
not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.</p>
<p>21:22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:
for they will hear that thou art come.</p>
<p>21:23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which
have a vow on them;</p>
<p>21:24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with
them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those
things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but
that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.</p>
<p>21:25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and
concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep
themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from
strangled, and from fornication.</p>
<p>21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with
them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days
of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one
of them.</p>
<p>21:27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were
of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and
laid hands on him,</p>
<p>21:28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth
all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and
further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy
place.</p>
<p>21:29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an
Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</p>
<p>21:30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and
they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the doors
were shut.</p>
<p>21:31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief
captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</p>
<p>21:32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto
them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left
beating of Paul.</p>
<p>21:33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded
him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he
had done.</p>
<p>21:34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude:
and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded
him to be carried into the castle.</p>
<p>21:35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne
of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</p>
<p>21:36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away
with him.</p>
<p>21:37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the
chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak
Greek?</p>
<p>21:38 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days madest an
uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were
murderers?</p>
<p>21:39 But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in
Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to
speak unto the people.</p>
<p>21:40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs,
and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a
great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,</p>
