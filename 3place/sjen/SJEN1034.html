以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 43章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>43:1 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looketh
toward the east:</p>
<p>43:2 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of
the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters: and the earth
shined with his glory.</p>
<p>43:3 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I
saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the
city: and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river
Chebar; and I fell upon my face.</p>
<p>43:4 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of the
gate whose prospect is toward the east.</p>
<p>43:5 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.</p>
<p>43:6 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
stood by me.</p>
<p>43:7 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and the
place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the midst of the
children of Israel for ever, and my holy name, shall the house of Israel
no more defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by
the carcases of their kings in their high places.</p>
<p>43:8 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and their
post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they have even
defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed:
wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.</p>
<p>43:9 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of their
kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.</p>
<p>43:10 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the
pattern.</p>
<p>43:11 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them
the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings out
thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all
the ordinances thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the laws
thereof: and write it in their sight, that they may keep the whole form
thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and do them.</p>
<p>43:12 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the
law of the house.</p>
<p>43:13 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The
cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be a cubit,
and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof
round about shall be a span: and this shall be the higher place of the
altar.</p>
<p>43:14 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser
settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits, and the breadth
one cubit.</p>
<p>43:15 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and
upward shall be four horns.</p>
<p>43:16 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square
in the four squares thereof.</p>
<p>43:17 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad
in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a
cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs
shall look toward the east.</p>
<p>43:18 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; These
are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to
offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.</p>
<p>43:19 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, saith the
Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.</p>
<p>43:20 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the
four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the
border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.</p>
<p>43:21 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the
sanctuary.</p>
<p>43:22 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar, as
they did cleanse it with the bullock.</p>
<p>43:23 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a
young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without
blemish.</p>
<p>43:24 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests
shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt
offering unto the LORD.</p>
<p>43:25 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram out of the
flock, without blemish.</p>
<p>43:26 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they
shall consecrate themselves.</p>
<p>43:27 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the
eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt offerings
upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, saith
the Lord GOD.</p>
