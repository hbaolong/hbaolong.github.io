第 8章 ( 本篇共有 10章 )</h4>
<p>8:1 These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of
Artaxerxes the king.</p>
<p>8:2 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel:
of the sons of David; Hattush.</p>
<p>8:3 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and
with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an hundred and
fifty.</p>
<p>8:4 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and
with him two hundred males.</p>
<p>8:5 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
three hundred males.</p>
<p>8:6 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with him
fifty males.</p>
<p>8:7 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and with
him seventy males.</p>
<p>8:8 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael, and
with him fourscore males.</p>
<p>8:9 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him two
hundred and eighteen males.</p>
<p>8:10 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him
an hundred and threescore males.</p>
<p>8:11 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
him twenty and eight males.</p>
<p>8:12 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and with
him an hundred and ten males.</p>
<p>8:13 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore males.</p>
<p>8:14 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
seventy males.</p>
<p>8:15 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to Ahava;
and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed the people, and the
priests, and found there none of the sons of Levi.</p>
<p>8:16 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and for
Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib, and for
Elnathan, men of understanding.</p>
<p>8:17 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto Iddo, and to
his brethren the Nethinims, at the place Casiphia, that they should
bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.</p>
<p>8:18 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man of
understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel;
and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;</p>
<p>8:19 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his
brethren and their sons, twenty;</p>
<p>8:20 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed
for the service of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of
them were expressed by name.</p>
<p>8:21 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for
us, and for our little ones, and for all our substance.</p>
<p>8:22 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and
horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because we had spoken
unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all them for good
that seek him; but his power and his wrath is against all them that
forsake him.</p>
<p>8:23 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was intreated
of us.</p>
<p>8:24 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests, Sherebiah,
Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,</p>
<p>8:25 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the vessels,
even the offering of the house of our God, which the king, and his
counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there present, had
offered:</p>
<p>8:26 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of
silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold an hundred
talents;</p>
<p>8:27 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two vessels
of fine copper, precious as gold.</p>
<p>8:28 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels are
holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering unto the
LORD God of your fathers.</p>
<p>8:29 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief of
the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of Israel, at
Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>8:30 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver,
and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house
of our God.</p>
<p>8:31 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon
us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay
in wait by the way.</p>
<p>8:32 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.</p>
<p>8:33 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son
of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinehas; and
with them was Jozabad the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui,
Levites;</p>
<p>8:34 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was
written at that time.</p>
<p>8:35 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which
were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of
Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and six rams, seventy and
seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin offering: all this was a burnt
offering unto the LORD.</p>
<p>8:36 And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s
lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and they
furthered the people, and the house of God.</p>
