第 11章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>11:1 Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town
of Mary and her sister Martha.</p>
<p>11:2 (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)</p>
<p>11:3 Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
whom thou lovest is sick.</p>
<p>11:4 When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death,
but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified
thereby.</p>
<p>11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</p>
<p>11:6 When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days
still in the same place where he was.</p>
<p>11:7 Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into Judaea
again.</p>
<p>11:8 His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</p>
<p>11:9 Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any
man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of
this world.</p>
<p>11:10 But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is
no light in him.</p>
<p>11:11 These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
sleep.</p>
<p>11:12 Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do
well.</p>
<p>11:13 Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
spoken of taking of rest in sleep.</p>
<p>11:14 Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</p>
<p>11:15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the
intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</p>
<p>11:16 Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his
fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</p>
<p>11:17 Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
four days already.</p>
<p>11:18 Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs
off:</p>
<p>11:19 And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning their brother.</p>
<p>11:20 Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.</p>
<p>11:21 Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.</p>
<p>11:22 But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God
will give it thee.</p>
<p>11:23 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</p>
<p>11:24 Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day.</p>
<p>11:25 Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:</p>
<p>11:26 And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
Believest thou this?</p>
<p>11:27 She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.</p>
<p>11:28 And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her
sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.</p>
<p>11:29 As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto
him.</p>
<p>11:30 Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place
where Martha met him.</p>
<p>11:31 The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed
her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there.</p>
<p>11:32 Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.</p>
<p>11:33 When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping
which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</p>
<p>11:34 And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
come and see.</p>
<p>11:35 Jesus wept.</p>
<p>11:36 Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!</p>
<p>11:37 And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the
eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have
died?</p>
<p>11:38 Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.
It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</p>
<p>11:39 Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he
hath been dead four days.</p>
<p>11:40 Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</p>
<p>11:41 Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was
laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that
thou hast heard me.</p>
<p>11:42 And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast
sent me.</p>
<p>11:43 And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
Lazarus, come forth.</p>
<p>11:44 And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith
unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</p>
<p>11:45 Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed on him.</p>
<p>11:46 But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told
them what things Jesus had done.</p>
<p>11:47 Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,
and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.</p>
<p>11:48 If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.</p>
<p>11:49 And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that
same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</p>
<p>11:50 Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should
die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</p>
<p>11:51 And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;</p>
<p>11:52 And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather
together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad.</p>
<p>11:53 Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
him to death.</p>
<p>11:54 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called
Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.</p>
<p>11:55 And the Jews’ passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify
themselves.</p>
<p>11:56 Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as they
stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the
feast?</p>
<p>11:57 Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a
commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it,
that they might take him.</p>
