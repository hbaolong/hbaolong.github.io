– 列王记上(1 13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by
the word of the LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to
burn incense.</h4>
<p>13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and
said, O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be born
unto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offer
the priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men’s
bones shall be burnt upon thee.</p>
<p>13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which
the LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes
that are upon it shall be poured out.</p>
<p>13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of the
man of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he put
forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,
which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it
in again to him.</p>
<p>13:5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the
altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word
of the LORD.</p>
<p>13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now
the face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be
restored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and the king’s
hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.</p>
<p>13:7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, and
refresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.</p>
<p>13:8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half
thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor
drink water in this place:</p>
<p>13:9 For so was it charged me by the word of the LORD, saying, Eat no
bread, nor drink water, nor turn again by the same way that thou
camest.</p>
<p>13:10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he
came to Bethel.</p>
<p>13:11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came and
told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel:
the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they told also to
their father.</p>
<p>13:12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sons
had seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.</p>
<p>13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled
him the ass: and he rode thereon,</p>
<p>13:14 And went after the man of God, and found him sitting under an
oak: and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that camest from
Judah? And he said, I am.</p>
<p>13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.</p>
<p>13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:
neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:</p>
<p>13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat
no bread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that
thou camest.</p>
<p>13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angel
spake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back with thee
into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied
unto him.</p>
<p>13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, and
drank water.</p>
<p>13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of
the LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back:</p>
<p>13:21 And he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying,
Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the
LORD, and hast not kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded
thee,</p>
<p>13:22 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the
place, of the which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no
water; thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.</p>
<p>13:23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he had
drunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whom he
had brought back.</p>
<p>13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:
and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lion
also stood by the carcase.</p>
<p>13:25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the
way, and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in
the city where the old prophet dwelt.</p>
<p>13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heard
thereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto the
word of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,
which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,
which he spake unto him.</p>
<p>13:27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And they
saddled him.</p>
<p>13:28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass
and the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten the
carcase, nor torn the ass.</p>
<p>13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laid
it upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to the
city, to mourn and to bury him.</p>
<p>13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned over
him, saying, Alas, my brother!</p>
<p>13:31 And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spake to
his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre wherein
the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones:</p>
<p>13:32 For the saying which he cried by the word of the LORD against
the altar in Bethel, and against all the houses of the high places which
are in the cities of Samaria, shall surely come to pass.</p>
<p>13:33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, but
made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:
whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of
the high places.</p>
<p>13:34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to
cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.</p>
