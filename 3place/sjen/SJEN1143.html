马太福音(Matthew) – 第 25章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>25:1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,
which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</p>
<p>25:2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</p>
<p>25:3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with
them:</p>
<p>25:4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</p>
<p>25:5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</p>
<p>25:6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom
cometh; go ye out to meet him.</p>
<p>25:7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</p>
<p>25:8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our
lamps are gone out.</p>
<p>25:9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough
for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for
yourselves.</p>
<p>25:10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that
were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</p>
<p>25:11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open
to us.</p>
<p>25:12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you
not.</p>
<p>25:13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
wherein the Son of man cometh.</p>
<p>25:14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far
country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his
goods.</p>
<p>25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
straightway took his journey.</p>
<p>25:16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with
the same, and made them other five talents.</p>
<p>25:17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other
two.</p>
<p>25:18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and
hid his lord’s money.</p>
<p>25:19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
reckoneth with them.</p>
<p>25:20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other
five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents:
behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</p>
<p>25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful
servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p>25:22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou
deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents
beside them.</p>
<p>25:23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;
thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over
many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</p>
<p>25:24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord,
I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,
and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</p>
<p>25:25 And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo,
there thou hast that is thine.</p>
<p>25:26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful
servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I
have not strawed:</p>
<p>25:27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers,
and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</p>
<p>25:28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which
hath ten talents.</p>
<p>25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have
abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that
which he hath.</p>
<p>25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there
shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy
angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</p>
<p>25:32 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall
separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from
the goats:</p>
<p>25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on
the left.</p>
<p>25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the
foundation of the world:</p>
<p>25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and
ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>
<p>25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was
in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>
<p>25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</p>
<p>25:38 When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and
clothed thee?</p>
<p>25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>
<p>25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto
you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my
brethren, ye have done it unto me.</p>
<p>25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his
angels:</p>
<p>25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty,
and ye gave me no drink:</p>
<p>25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed
me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>
<p>25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee
an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison,
and did not minister unto thee?</p>
<p>25:45 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you,
Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to
me.</p>
<p>25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the
righteous into life eternal.</p>
