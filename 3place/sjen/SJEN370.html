申命记(Deuteronomy) – 第 28章 ( 本篇共有 34章 )</h4>
<p>28:1 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently unto
the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all his commandments
which I command thee this day, that the LORD thy God will set thee on
high above all nations of the earth:</p>
<p>28:2 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee,
if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p>28:3 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in
the field.</p>
<p>28:4 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine, and the
flocks of thy sheep.</p>
<p>28:5 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.</p>
<p>28:6 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt
thou be when thou goest out.</p>
<p>28:7 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee to
be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way,
and flee before thee seven ways.</p>
<p>28:8 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy
storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and he shall
bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p>
<p>28:9 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as he
hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD
thy God, and walk in his ways.</p>
<p>28:10 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.</p>
<p>28:11 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit
of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit of thy
ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers to give
thee.</p>
<p>28:12 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to
give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of
thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not
borrow.</p>
<p>28:13 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if that thou
hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God, which I command thee
this day, to observe and to do them:</p>
<p>28:14 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I
command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to go after
other gods to serve them.</p>
<p>28:15 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the
voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his
statutes which I command thee this day; that all these curses shall come
upon thee, and overtake thee:</p>
<p>28:16 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in
the field.</p>
<p>28:17 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.</p>
<p>28:18 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.</p>
<p>28:19 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou
be when thou goest out.</p>
<p>28:20 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke, in
all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou be
destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the wickedness of
thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.</p>
<p>28:21 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he
have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to possess
it.</p>
<p>28:22 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a fever,
and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning, and with the
sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and they shall pursue thee
until thou perish.</p>
<p>28:23 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
earth that is under thee shall be iron.</p>
<p>28:24 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.</p>
<p>28:25 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies:
thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways before them:
and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</p>
<p>28:26 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.</p>
<p>28:27 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou canst not be
healed.</p>
<p>28:28 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
astonishment of heart:</p>
<p>28:29 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in
darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou shalt be only
oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall save thee.</p>
<p>28:30 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein: thou shalt
plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.</p>
<p>28:31 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy
face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given unto
thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to rescue them.</p>
<p>28:32 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people,
and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day
long: and there shall be no might in thine hand:</p>
<p>28:33 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only oppressed and
crushed alway:</p>
<p>28:34 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which
thou shalt see.</p>
<p>28:35 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with a
sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot unto the top
of thy head.</p>
<p>28:36 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known;
and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and stone.</p>
<p>28:37 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,
among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.</p>
<p>28:38 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt gather
but little in; for the locust shall consume it.</p>
<p>28:39 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither
drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall eat
them.</p>
<p>28:40 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou
shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his
fruit.</p>
<p>28:41 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy
them; for they shall go into captivity.</p>
<p>28:42 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust
consume.</p>
<p>28:43 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
high; and thou shalt come down very low.</p>
<p>28:44 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall
be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.</p>
<p>28:45 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed; because thou
hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to keep his
commandments and his statutes which he commanded thee:</p>
<p>28:46 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and
upon thy seed for ever.</p>
<p>28:47 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness, and
with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;</p>
<p>28:48 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall
send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in
want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck, until
he have destroyed thee.</p>
<p>28:49 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose tongue
thou shalt not understand;</p>
<p>28:50 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:</p>
<p>28:51 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee either
corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or flocks of thy sheep,
until he have destroyed thee.</p>
<p>28:52 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all thy land:
and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land,
which the LORD thy God hath given thee.</p>
<p>28:53 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath given thee,
in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall
distress thee:</p>
<p>28:54 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate,
his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his
bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave:</p>
<p>28:55 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him in the
siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies shall distress
thee in all thy gates.</p>
<p>28:56 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness
and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom,
and toward her son, and toward her daughter,</p>
<p>28:57 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her feet,
and toward her children which she shall bear: for she shall eat them for
want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness, wherewith thine
enemy shall distress thee in thy gates.</p>
<p>28:58 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious and
fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;</p>
<p>28:59 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues
of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and sore
sicknesses, and of long continuance.</p>
<p>28:60 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.</p>
<p>28:61 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee, until thou be
destroyed.</p>
<p>28:62 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the
stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey the voice
of the LORD thy God.</p>
<p>28:63 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you
to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice over you
to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye shall be plucked from
off the land whither thou goest to possess it.</p>
<p>28:64 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt serve other
gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and
stone.</p>
<p>28:65 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee there a
trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of mind:</p>
<p>28:66 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt
fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:</p>
<p>28:67 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at
even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear of thine
heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of thine eyes which
thou shalt see.</p>
<p>28:68 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more again: and
there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and
no man shall buy you.</p>
