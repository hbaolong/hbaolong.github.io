第 5章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a
possession,</p>
<p>5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it,
and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</p>
<p>5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie
to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</p>
<p>5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,
was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in
thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</p>
<p>5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost:
and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</p>
<p>5:6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and
buried him.</p>
<p>5:7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,
not knowing what was done, came in.</p>
<p>5:8 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for
so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.</p>
<p>5:9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together
to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have
buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.</p>
<p>5:10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the
ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying her
forth, buried her by her husband.</p>
<p>5:11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as
heard these things.</p>
<p>5:12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders
wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in
Solomon’s porch.</p>
<p>5:13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the
people magnified them.</p>
<p>5:14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both
of men and women.)</p>
<p>5:15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and
laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter
passing by might overshadow some of them.</p>
<p>5:16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto
Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean
spirits: and they were healed every one.</p>
<p>5:17 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,
(which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with
indignation,</p>
<p>5:18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common
prison.</p>
<p>5:19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and
brought them forth, and said,</p>
<p>5:20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of
this life.</p>
<p>5:21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in
the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were
with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the
children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</p>
<p>5:22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,
they returned, and told,</p>
<p>5:23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the
keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we
found no man within.</p>
<p>5:24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the
chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this
would grow.</p>
<p>5:25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put
in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</p>
<p>5:26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been
stoned.</p>
<p>5:27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the
council: and the high priest asked them,</p>
<p>5:28 Saying, Did not we straitly command you that ye should not teach
in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine,
and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.</p>
<p>5:29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to
obey God rather than men.</p>
<p>5:30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged
on a tree.</p>
<p>5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a
Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>5:32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the
Holy Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</p>
<p>5:33 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took
counsel to slay them.</p>
<p>5:34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named
Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people,
and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space;</p>
<p>5:35 And said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves
what ye intend to do as touching these men.</p>
<p>5:36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be
somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined
themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were
scattered, and brought to nought.</p>
<p>5:37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the
taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all,
even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</p>
<p>5:38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them
alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to
nought:</p>
<p>5:39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be
found even to fight against God.</p>
<p>5:40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,
and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name
of Jesus, and let them go.</p>
<p>5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</p>
<p>5:42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to
teach and preach Jesus Christ.</p>
