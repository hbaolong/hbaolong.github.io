– 约翰壹书(1 3:1 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed
upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</h4>
<p>3:2 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear
what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be
like him; for we shall see him as he is.</p>
<p>3:3 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even
as he is pure.</p>
<p>3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is
the transgression of the law.</p>
<p>3:5 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in
him is no sin.</p>
<p>3:6 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not
seen him, neither known him.</p>
<p>3:7 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</p>
<p>3:8 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that
he might destroy the works of the devil.</p>
<p>3:9 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</p>
<p>3:10 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he
that loveth not his brother.</p>
<p>3:11 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that
we should love one another.</p>
<p>3:12 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his
brother’s righteous.</p>
<p>3:13 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</p>
<p>3:14 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</p>
<p>3:15 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no
murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</p>
<p>3:16 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</p>
<p>3:17 But whoso hath this world’s good, and seeth his brother have
need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth
the love of God in him?</p>
<p>3:18 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue;
but in deed and in truth.</p>
<p>3:19 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
our hearts before him.</p>
<p>3:20 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and
knoweth all things.</p>
<p>3:21 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God.</p>
<p>3:22 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</p>
<p>3:23 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name
of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us
commandment.</p>
<p>3:24 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in
him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he
hath given us.</p>
