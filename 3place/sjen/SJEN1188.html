第 2章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
the mother of Jesus was there:</p>
<p>2:2 And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the
marriage.</p>
<p>2:3 And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine.</p>
<p>2:4 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
hour is not yet come.</p>
<p>2:5 His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you,
do it.</p>
<p>2:6 And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner
of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins
apiece.</p>
<p>2:7 Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
filled them up to the brim.</p>
<p>2:8 And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor
of the feast. And they bare it.</p>
<p>2:9 When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water
knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,</p>
<p>2:10 And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but
thou hast kept the good wine until now.</p>
<p>2:11 This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</p>
<p>2:12 After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and
his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many
days.</p>
<p>2:13 And the Jews’ passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem,</p>
<p>2:14 And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
doves, and the changers of money sitting:</p>
<p>2:15 And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all
out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the
changers’ money, and overthrew the tables;</p>
<p>2:16 And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence;
make not my Father’s house an house of merchandise.</p>
<p>2:17 And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of
thine house hath eaten me up.</p>
<p>2:18 Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou
unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</p>
<p>2:19 Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in
three days I will raise it up.</p>
<p>2:20 Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in
building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</p>
<p>2:21 But he spake of the temple of his body.</p>
<p>2:22 When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples
remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the
scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</p>
<p>2:23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day,
many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.</p>
<p>2:24 But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all
men,</p>
<p>2:25 And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what
was in man.</p>
