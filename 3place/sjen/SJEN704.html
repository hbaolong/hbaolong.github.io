37章 ( 本篇共有 150章 )</h4>
<p>37:1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
against the workers of iniquity.</p>
<p>37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
the green herb.</p>
<p>37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,
and verily thou shalt be fed.</p>
<p>37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
desires of thine heart.</p>
<p>37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
bring it to pass.</p>
<p>37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy
judgment as the noonday.</p>
<p>37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who
bringeth wicked devices to pass.</p>
<p>37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
wise to do evil.</p>
<p>37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</p>
<p>37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</p>
<p>37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
themselves in the abundance of peace.</p>
<p>37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
with his teeth.</p>
<p>37:13 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
coming.</p>
<p>37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright
conversation.</p>
<p>37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
shall be broken.</p>
<p>37:16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of
many wicked.</p>
<p>37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
upholdeth the righteous.</p>
<p>37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance
shall be for ever.</p>
<p>37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
famine they shall be satisfied.</p>
<p>37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they
consume away.</p>
<p>37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
sheweth mercy, and giveth.</p>
<p>37:22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they
that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</p>
<p>37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
delighteth in his way.</p>
<p>37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD
upholdeth him with his hand.</p>
<p>37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</p>
<p>37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.</p>
<p>37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</p>
<p>37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut
off.</p>
<p>37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
ever.</p>
<p>37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
talketh of judgment.</p>
<p>37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
slide.</p>
<p>37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</p>
<p>37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
he is judged.</p>
<p>37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</p>
<p>37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
like a green bay tree.</p>
<p>37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but
he could not be found.</p>
<p>37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
that man is peace.</p>
<p>37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
the wicked shall be cut off.</p>
<p>37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
strength in the time of trouble.</p>
<p>37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in
him.</p>
