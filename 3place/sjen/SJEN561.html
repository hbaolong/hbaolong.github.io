– 历代记下(2 5:1 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of
the LORD was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David
his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and all the
instruments, put he among the treasures of the house of God.</h4>
<p>5:2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of
the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, unto
Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the
city of David, which is Zion.</p>
<p>5:3 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
king in the feast which was in the seventh month.</p>
<p>5:4 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
ark.</p>
<p>5:5 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,
these did the priests and the Levites bring up.</p>
<p>5:6 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that were
assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and oxen, which
could not be told nor numbered for multitude.</p>
<p>5:7 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy place,
even under the wings of the cherubims:</p>
<p>5:8 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of the
ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereof above.</p>
<p>5:9 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were not seen
without. And there it is unto this day.</p>
<p>5:10 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses put
therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the children of
Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</p>
<p>5:11 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holy
place: (for all the priests that were present were sanctified, and did
not then wait by course:</p>
<p>5:12 Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph,
of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren, being arrayed
in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the
east end of the altar, and with them an hundred and twenty priests
sounding with trumpets:)</p>
<p>5:13 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as one,
to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking the LORD; and
when they lifted up their voice with the trumpets and cymbals and
instruments of musick, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good; for
his mercy endureth for ever: that then the house was filled with a
cloud, even the house of the LORD;</p>
<p>5:14 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the
cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of God.</p>
