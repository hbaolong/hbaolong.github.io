– 历代记下(2 1:1 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his
kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him
exceedingly.</h4>
<p>1:2 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands
and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all Israel,
the chief of the fathers.</p>
<p>1:3 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the high
place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of the
congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the
wilderness.</p>
<p>1:4 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to the
place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched a tent for it
at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>1:5 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son
of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the LORD: and Solomon
and the congregation sought unto it.</p>
<p>1:6 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the LORD,
which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and offered a thousand
burnt offerings upon it.</p>
<p>1:7 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him, Ask
what I shall give thee.</p>
<p>1:8 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.</p>
<p>1:9 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the dust of
the earth in multitude.</p>
<p>1:10 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come in
before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that is so
great?</p>
<p>1:11 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of thine
enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast asked wisdom and
knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I
have made thee king:</p>
<p>1:12 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give thee
riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings have had that
have been before thee, neither shall there any after thee have the
like.</p>
<p>1:13 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was at
Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the congregation, and
reigned over Israel.</p>
<p>1:14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, which
he placed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>1:15 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the
vale for abundance.</p>
<p>1:16 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: the
king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.</p>
<p>1:17 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and
fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of the Hittites,
and for the kings of Syria, by their means.</p>
