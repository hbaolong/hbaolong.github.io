第 15章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</p>
<p>15:2 Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and
every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth
more fruit.</p>
<p>15:3 Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto
you.</p>
<p>15:4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of
itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in
me.</p>
<p>15:5 I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I
in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do
nothing.</p>
<p>15:6 If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is
withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are
burned.</p>
<p>15:7 If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what
ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</p>
<p>15:8 Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall
ye be my disciples.</p>
<p>15:9 As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in
my love.</p>
<p>15:10 If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as
I have kept my Father’s commandments, and abide in his love.</p>
<p>15:11 These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain
in you, and that your joy might be full.</p>
<p>15:12 This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have
loved you.</p>
<p>15:13 Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends.</p>
<p>15:14 Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</p>
<p>15:15 Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not
what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that
I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</p>
<p>15:16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you,
that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should
remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may
give it you.</p>
<p>15:17 These things I command you, that ye love one another.</p>
<p>15:18 If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated
you.</p>
<p>15:19 If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but
because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world,
therefore the world hateth you.</p>
<p>15:20 Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not
greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also
persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours
also.</p>
<p>15:21 But all these things will they do unto you for my name’s sake,
because they know not him that sent me.</p>
<p>15:22 If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin:
but now they have no cloak for their sin.</p>
<p>15:23 He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</p>
<p>15:24 If I had not done among them the works which none other man
did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me
and my Father.</p>
<p>15:25 But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that
is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</p>
<p>15:26 But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from
the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father,
he shall testify of me:</p>
<p>15:27 And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me
from the beginning.</p>
