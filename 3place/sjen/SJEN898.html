以赛亚书(Isaiah) – 第 30章 ( 本篇共有 66章 )</h4>
<p>30:1 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but not of my
spirit, that they may add sin to sin:</p>
<p>30:2 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth;
to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to trust in the
shadow of Egypt!</p>
<p>30:3 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the
trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.</p>
<p>30:4 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to
Hanes.</p>
<p>30:5 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them,
nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</p>
<p>30:6 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble
and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and
fiery flying serpent, they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of
young asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people
that shall not profit them.</p>
<p>30:7 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to sit
still.</p>
<p>30:8 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book,
that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:</p>
<p>30:9 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children that
will not hear the law of the LORD:</p>
<p>30:10 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy
deceits:</p>
<p>30:11 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the
Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</p>
<p>30:12 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise
this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and stay
thereon:</p>
<p>30:13 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh suddenly at an
instant.</p>
<p>30:14 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters’ vessel
that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be
found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth, or to
take water withal out of the pit.</p>
<p>30:15 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence
shall be your strength: and ye would not.</p>
<p>30:16 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that
pursue you be swift.</p>
<p>30:17 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top of a
mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.</p>
<p>30:18 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you:
for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all they that wait for
him.</p>
<p>30:19 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice of thy
cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.</p>
<p>30:20 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed into a corner
any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:</p>
<p>30:21 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn
to the left.</p>
<p>30:22 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast
them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Get thee
hence.</p>
<p>30:23 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow
the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and it shall
be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle feed in large
pastures.</p>
<p>30:24 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground shall
eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and with
the fan.</p>
<p>30:25 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every
high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great
slaughter, when the towers fall.</p>
<p>30:26 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven
days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach of his people, and
healeth the stroke of their wound.</p>
<p>30:27 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:</p>
<p>30:28 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the
midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of vanity: and
there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to
err.</p>
<p>30:29 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to come into
the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.</p>
<p>30:30 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his
anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and
tempest, and hailstones.</p>
<p>30:31 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
down, which smote with a rod.</p>
<p>30:32 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and harps: and in
battles of shaking will he fight with it.</p>
<p>30:33 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is fire and
much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of brimstone, doth
kindle it.</p>
