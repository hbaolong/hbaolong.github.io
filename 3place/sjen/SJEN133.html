利未记(Leviticus) – 第 13章 ( 本篇共有 27章 )</h4>
<p>13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,</p>
<p>13:2 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab,
or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like the plague of
leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the priest, or unto one of
his sons the priests:</p>
<p>13:3 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and the plague
in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of
leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and pronounce him
unclean.</p>
<p>13:4 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not turned
white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague seven
days:</p>
<p>13:5 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,
if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread not in
the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days more:</p>
<p>13:6 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread not in the
skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is but a scab: and he
shall wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>
<p>13:7 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the
priest again:</p>
<p>13:8 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.</p>
<p>13:9 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought
unto the priest;</p>
<p>13:10 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be
white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and there be quick
raw flesh in the rising;</p>
<p>13:11 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he is
unclean.</p>
<p>13:12 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head even to his
foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;</p>
<p>13:13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy
have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that hath the
plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.</p>
<p>13:14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.</p>
<p>13:15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be
unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.</p>
<p>13:16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
shall come unto the priest;</p>
<p>13:17 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be
turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean that hath
the plague: he is clean.</p>
<p>13:18 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a boil,
and is healed,</p>
<p>13:19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to the
priest;</p>
<p>13:20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall
pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the
boil.</p>
<p>13:21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be somewhat
dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</p>
<p>13:22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.</p>
<p>13:23 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it is
a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>
<p>13:24 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright spot,
somewhat reddish, or white;</p>
<p>13:25 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair in
the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper than the
skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest
shall pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</p>
<p>13:26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other skin, but be
somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:</p>
<p>13:27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it
be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him
unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.</p>
<p>13:28 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in the
skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the burning, and the
priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is an inflammation of the
burning.</p>
<p>13:29 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;</p>
<p>13:30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin hair; then
the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry scall, even a
leprosy upon the head or beard.</p>
<p>13:31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold,
it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that there is no black hair
in it; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the plague of the
scall seven days:</p>
<p>13:32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair,
and the scall be not in sight deeper than the skin;</p>
<p>13:33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:</p>
<p>13:34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and,
behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in sight deeper
than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall
wash his clothes, and be clean.</p>
<p>13:35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his
cleansing;</p>
<p>13:36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be
spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he is
unclean.</p>
<p>13:37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean: and the
priest shall pronounce him clean.</p>
<p>13:38 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright
spots, even white bright spots;</p>
<p>13:39 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots in
the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled spot that
groweth in the skin; he is clean.</p>
<p>13:40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
is he clean.</p>
<p>13:41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.</p>
<p>13:42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald
forehead.</p>
<p>13:43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead,
as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;</p>
<p>13:44 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.</p>
<p>13:45 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent,
and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and
shall cry, Unclean, unclean.</p>
<p>13:46 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp shall his
habitation be.</p>
<p>13:47 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;</p>
<p>13:48 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;</p>
<p>13:49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in
the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto the priest:</p>
<p>13:50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that
hath the plague seven days:</p>
<p>13:51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the plague is a fretting
leprosy; it is unclean.</p>
<p>13:52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it
is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>
<p>13:53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any
thing of skin;</p>
<p>13:54 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein
the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:</p>
<p>13:55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his colour, and the
plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it
is fret inward, whether it be bare within or without.</p>
<p>13:56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat
dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment,
or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:</p>
<p>13:57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or
in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading plague: thou
shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.</p>
<p>13:58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them,
then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.</p>
<p>13:59 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to
pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.</p>
