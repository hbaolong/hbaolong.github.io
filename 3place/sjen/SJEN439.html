– 撒母耳记上(1 14:1 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the
son of Saul said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let
us go over to the Philistines’ garrison, that is on the other side. But
he told not his father.</h4>
<p>14:2 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were with him
were about six hundred men;</p>
<p>14:3 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of
Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’s priest in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.
And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.</p>
<p>14:4 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side,
and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of the one was Bozez,
and the name of the other Seneh.</p>
<p>14:5 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.</p>
<p>14:6 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised: it may be
that the LORD will work for us: for there is no restraint to the LORD to
save by many or by few.</p>
<p>14:7 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy heart.</p>
<p>14:8 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men,
and we will discover ourselves unto them.</p>
<p>14:9 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.</p>
<p>14:10 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be a sign
unto us.</p>
<p>14:11 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of the
Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth
out of the holes where they had hid themselves.</p>
<p>14:12 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a thing. And
Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me: for the LORD hath
delivered them into the hand of Israel.</p>
<p>14:13 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and his
armourbearer slew after him.</p>
<p>14:14 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of land,
which a yoke of oxen might plow.</p>
<p>14:15 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled, and
the earth quaked: so it was a very great trembling.</p>
<p>14:16 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one
another.</p>
<p>14:17 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold,
Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.</p>
<p>14:18 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.</p>
<p>14:19 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased:
and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.</p>
<p>14:20 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every man’s sword
was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.</p>
<p>14:21 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before that
time, which went up with them into the camp from the country round
about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with
Saul and Jonathan.</p>
<p>14:22 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even they also
followed hard after them in the battle.</p>
<p>14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
unto Bethaven.</p>
<p>14:24 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any food until
evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So none of the people
tasted any food.</p>
<p>14:25 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
upon the ground.</p>
<p>14:26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the
oath.</p>
<p>14:27 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was in his
hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and
his eyes were enlightened.</p>
<p>14:28 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth
any food this day. And the people were faint.</p>
<p>14:29 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I tasted a little
of this honey.</p>
<p>14:30 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not been now
a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?</p>
<p>14:31 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
Aijalon: and the people were very faint.</p>
<p>14:32 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did eat them
with the blood.</p>
<p>14:33 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the
LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye have
transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.</p>
<p>14:34 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his sheep,
and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the LORD in eating with
the blood. And all the people brought every man his ox with him that
night, and slew them there.</p>
<p>14:35 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
altar that he built unto the LORD.</p>
<p>14:36 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of
them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto thee. Then said the
priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.</p>
<p>14:37 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he
answered him not that day.</p>
<p>14:38 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.</p>
<p>14:39 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man among all
the people that answered him.</p>
<p>14:40 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto
Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.</p>
<p>14:41 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a perfect
lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people escaped.</p>
<p>14:42 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
Jonathan was taken.</p>
<p>14:43 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end
of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must die.</p>
<p>14:44 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
surely die, Jonathan.</p>
<p>14:45 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the LORD liveth,
there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he hath
wrought with God this day. So the people rescued Jonathan, that he died
not.</p>
<p>14:46 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
Philistines went to their own place.</p>
<p>14:47 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of
Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the
Philistines: and whithersoever he turned himself, he vexed them.</p>
<p>14:48 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and
delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.</p>
<p>14:49 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn
Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:</p>
<p>14:50 And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of
Ner, Saul’s uncle.</p>
<p>14:51 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
was the son of Abiel.</p>
<p>14:52 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him
unto him.</p>
