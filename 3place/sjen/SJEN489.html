– 列王记上(1 9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the
building of the house of the LORD, and the king’s house, and all
Solomon’s desire which he was pleased to do,</h4>
<p>9:2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon the second time, as he had
appeared unto him at Gibeon.</p>
<p>9:3 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy
supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house,
which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine eyes and
mine heart shall be there perpetually.</p>
<p>9:4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, in
integrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that I
have commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments:</p>
<p>9:5 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for
ever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail
thee a man upon the throne of Israel.</p>
<p>9:6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or your
children, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have
set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:</p>
<p>9:7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have given
them; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I cast out
of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all
people:</p>
<p>9:8 And at this house, which is high, every one that passeth by it
shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Why hath the
LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?</p>
<p>9:9 And they shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God,
who brought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken
hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:
therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.</p>
<p>9:10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had
built the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king’s house,</p>
<p>9:11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedar
trees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) that
then king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.</p>
<p>9:12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had
given him; and they pleased him not.</p>
<p>9:13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my
brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.</p>
<p>9:14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.</p>
<p>9:15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised;
for to build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and
the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.</p>
<p>9:16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and
burnt it with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and
given it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.</p>
<p>9:17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether,</p>
<p>9:18 And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land,</p>
<p>9:19 And all the cities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his
chariots, and cities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to
build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his
dominion.</p>
<p>9:20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,
Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of
Israel,</p>
<p>9:21 Their children that were left after them in the land, whom the
children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did
Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.</p>
<p>9:22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but
they were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and his
captains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.</p>
<p>9:23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon’s
work, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people that
wrought in the work.</p>
<p>9:24 But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her
house which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.</p>
<p>9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and
peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and he
burnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finished
the house.</p>
<p>9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is
beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.</p>
<p>9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that had
knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.</p>
<p>9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, four
hundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.</p>
