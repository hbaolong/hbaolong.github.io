第 17章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>17:1 These words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and
said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may
glorify thee:</p>
<p>17:2 As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give
eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</p>
<p>17:3 And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only
true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</p>
<p>17:4 I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work
which thou gavest me to do.</p>
<p>17:5 And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the
glory which I had with thee before the world was.</p>
<p>17:6 I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out
of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have
kept thy word.</p>
<p>17:7 Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given
me are of thee.</p>
<p>17:8 For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and
they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from
thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</p>
<p>17:9 I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which
thou hast given me; for they are thine.</p>
<p>17:10 And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified
in them.</p>
<p>17:11 And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world,
and I come to thee. Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom
thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</p>
<p>17:12 While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name:
those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the
son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</p>
<p>17:13 And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world,
that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</p>
<p>17:14 I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them,
because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
<p>17:15 I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but
that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</p>
<p>17:16 They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</p>
<p>17:17 Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</p>
<p>17:18 As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent
them into the world.</p>
<p>17:19 And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be
sanctified through the truth.</p>
<p>17:20 Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall
believe on me through their word;</p>
<p>17:21 That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in
thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that
thou hast sent me.</p>
<p>17:22 And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they
may be one, even as we are one:</p>
<p>17:23 I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in
one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved
them, as thou hast loved me.</p>
<p>17:24 Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with
me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me:
for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>17:25 O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have
known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</p>
<p>17:26 And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it:
that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in
them.</p>
