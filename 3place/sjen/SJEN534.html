they were valiant men of might in their generations; whose number was in
the days of David two and twenty thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p>7:3 And the sons of Uzzi; Izrahiah: and the sons of Izrahiah;
Michael, and Obadiah, and Joel, Ishiah, five: all of them chief men.</p>
<p>7:4 And with them, by their generations, after the house of their
fathers, were bands of soldiers for war, six and thirty thousand men:
for they had many wives and sons.</p>
<p>7:5 And their brethren among all the families of Issachar were
valiant men of might, reckoned in all by their genealogies fourscore and
seven thousand.</p>
<p>7:6 The sons of Benjamin; Bela, and Becher, and Jediael, three.</p>
<p>7:7 And the sons of Bela; Ezbon, and Uzzi, and Uzziel, and Jerimoth,

whom the men of Gath that were born in that land slew, because they came
down to take away their cattle.</p>
<p>7:22 And Ephraim their father mourned many days, and his brethren
came to comfort him.</p>
<p>7:23 And when he went in to his wife, she conceived, and bare a son,
and he called his name Beriah, because it went evil with his house.</p>
<p>7:24 (And his daughter was Sherah, who built Bethhoron the nether,
