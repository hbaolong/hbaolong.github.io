– 列王记下(2 15:1 In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of
Israel began Azariah son of Amaziah king of Judah to reign.</h4>
<p>15:2 Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned
two and fifty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jecholiah of
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>15:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
according to all that his father Amaziah had done;</p>
<p>15:4 Save that the high places were not removed: the people
sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.</p>
<p>15:5 And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day
of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king’s son
was over the house, judging the people of the land.</p>
<p>15:6 And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah?</p>
<p>15:7 So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his
fathers in the city of David: and Jotham his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>15:8 In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of Judah did
Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over Israel in Samaria six
months.</p>
<p>15:9 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his
fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of
Nebat, who made Israel to sin.</p>
<p>15:10 And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote
him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>15:11 And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written
in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.</p>
<p>15:12 This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying,
Thy sons shall sit on the throne of Israel unto the fourth generation.
And so it came to pass.</p>
<p>15:13 Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and
thirtieth year of Uzziah king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in
Samaria.</p>
<p>15:14 For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to
Samaria, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in Samaria, and slew him,
and reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>15:15 And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which
he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.</p>
<p>15:16 Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the
coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he
smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped
up.</p>
<p>15:17 In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of Judah began
Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over Israel, and reigned ten years in
Samaria.</p>
<p>15:18 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat,
who made Israel to sin.</p>
<p>15:19 And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem
gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him
to confirm the kingdom in his hand.</p>
<p>15:20 And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of all the mighty
men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king
of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and stayed not there in
the land.</p>
<p>15:21 And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel?</p>
<p>15:22 And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son
reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>15:23 In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekahiah the son
of Menahem began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned two
years.</p>
<p>15:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel
to sin.</p>
<p>15:25 But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired
against him, and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s
house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites:
and he killed him, and reigned in his room.</p>
<p>15:26 And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did,
behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel.</p>
<p>15:27 In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of Judah Pekah the
son of Remaliah began to reign over Israel in Samaria, and reigned
twenty years.</p>
<p>15:28 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel
to sin.</p>
<p>15:29 In the days of Pekah king of Israel came Tiglathpileser king of
Assyria, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and
Hazor, and Gilead, and Galilee, all the land of Naphtali, and carried
them captive to Assyria.</p>
<p>15:30 And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah the
son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead,
in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah.</p>
<p>15:31 And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold,
they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Israel.</p>
<p>15:32 In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel
began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of Judah to reign.</p>
<p>15:33 Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he
reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerusha,
the daughter of Zadok.</p>
<p>15:34 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he
did according to all that his father Uzziah had done.</p>
<p>15:35 Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed
and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of
the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>15:36 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah?</p>
<p>15:37 In those days the LORD began to send against Judah Rezin the
king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah.</p>
<p>15:38 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
