第29章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>29:1 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the
people of the east.</p>
<p>29:2 And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there
were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well they
watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.</p>
<p>29:3 And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the
stone from the well’s mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone
again upon the well’s mouth in his place.</p>
<p>29:4 And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they
said, Of Haran are we.</p>
<p>29:5 And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they
said, We know him.</p>
<p>29:6 And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:
and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</p>
<p>29:7 And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that the
cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep, and go and feed
them.</p>
<p>29:8 And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered
together, and till they roll the stone from the well’s mouth; then we
water the sheep.</p>
<p>29:9 And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her father’s
sheep: for she kept them.</p>
<p>29:10 And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of
Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother,
that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth, and
watered the flock of Laban his mother’s brother.</p>
<p>29:11 And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
<p>29:12 And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father’s brother, and
that he was Rebekah’s son: and she ran and told her father.</p>
<p>29:13 And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his
sister’s son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him,
and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.</p>
<p>29:14 And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.
And he abode with him the space of a month.</p>
<p>29:15 And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,
shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what shall thy
wages be?</p>
<p>29:16 And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,
and the name of the younger was Rachel.</p>
<p>29:17 Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well
favoured.</p>
<p>29:18 And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven years
for Rachel thy younger daughter.</p>
<p>29:19 And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than that
I should give her to another man: abide with me.</p>
<p>29:20 And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto
him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</p>
<p>29:21 And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are
fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</p>
<p>29:22 And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made
a feast.</p>
<p>29:23 And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his
daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</p>
<p>29:24 And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an
handmaid.</p>
<p>29:25 And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:
and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did not I
serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou beguiled me?</p>
<p>29:26 And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give
the younger before the firstborn.</p>
<p>29:27 Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the
service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</p>
<p>29:28 And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him
Rachel his daughter to wife also.</p>
<p>29:29 And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be
her maid.</p>
<p>29:30 And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more
than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</p>
<p>29:31 And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:
but Rachel was barren.</p>
<p>29:32 And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name
Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my affliction;
now therefore my husband will love me.</p>
<p>29:33 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the
LORD hath heard that I was hated, he hath therefore given me this son
also: and she called his name Simeon.</p>
<p>29:34 And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this
time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born him three
sons: therefore was his name called Levi.</p>
<p>29:35 And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now will
I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah; and left
bearing.</p>
