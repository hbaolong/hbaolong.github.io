第 20章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>20:1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the
disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</p>
<p>20:2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much
exhortation, he came into Greece,</p>
<p>20:3 And there abode three months. And when the Jews laid wait for
him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through
Macedonia.</p>
<p>20:4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the
Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and
Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</p>
<p>20:5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.</p>
<p>20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened
bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven
days.</p>
<p>20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came
together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the
morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</p>
<p>20:8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were
gathered together.</p>
<p>20:9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,
being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk
down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up
dead.</p>
<p>20:10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,
Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</p>
<p>20:11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and
eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he
departed.</p>
<p>20:12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little
comforted.</p>
<p>20:13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there
intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to
go afoot.</p>
<p>20:14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to
Mitylene.</p>
<p>20:15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;
and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the
next day we came to Miletus.</p>
<p>20:16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would
not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him,
to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p>20:17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of
the church.</p>
<p>20:18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know,
from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been
with you at all seasons,</p>
<p>20:19 Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many
tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the
Jews:</p>
<p>20:20 And how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but
have shewed you, and have taught you publickly, and from house to
house,</p>
<p>20:21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>20:22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not
knowing the things that shall befall me there:</p>
<p>20:23 Save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that
bonds and afflictions abide me.</p>
<p>20:24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the
ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel
of the grace of God.</p>
<p>20:25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone
preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</p>
<p>20:26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from
the blood of all men.</p>
<p>20:27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of
God.</p>
<p>20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over
the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of
God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</p>
<p>20:29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves
enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</p>
<p>20:30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse
things, to draw away disciples after them.</p>
<p>20:31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years
I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</p>
<p>20:32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his
grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance
among all them which are sanctified.</p>
<p>20:33 I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.</p>
<p>20:34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto
my necessities, and to them that were with me.</p>
<p>20:35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to
support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he
said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</p>
<p>20:36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with
them all.</p>
<p>20:37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed
him,</p>
<p>20:38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they
should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</p>
