– 历代记下(2 14:1 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him
in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days
the land was quiet ten years.</h4>
<p>14:2 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the
LORD his God:</p>
<p>14:3 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high
places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</p>
<p>14:4 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and
to do the law and the commandment.</p>
<p>14:5 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places
and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</p>
<p>14:6 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and
he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</p>
<p>14:7 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and
make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is
yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought
him, and he hath given us rest on every side. So they built and
prospered.</p>
<p>14:8 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of
Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and
drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men
of valour.</p>
<p>14:9 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host
of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto
Mareshah.</p>
<p>14:10 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array
in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</p>
<p>14:11 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no
power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we
go against this multitude. O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail
against thee.</p>
<p>14:12 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
and the Ethiopians fled.</p>
<p>14:13 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover
themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his
host; and they carried away very much spoil.</p>
<p>14:14 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there
was exceeding much spoil in them.</p>
<p>14:15 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and
camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</p>
