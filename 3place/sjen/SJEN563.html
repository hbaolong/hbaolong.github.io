– 历代记下(2 7:1 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire
came down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.</h4>
<p>7:2 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD’s house.</p>
<p>7:3 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down,
and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed themselves with
their faces to the ground upon the pavement, and worshipped, and praised
the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
LORD.</p>
<p>7:5 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two thousand
oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so the king and all the
people dedicated the house of God.</p>
<p>7:6 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had made to
praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever, when David praised
by their ministry; and the priests sounded trumpets before them, and all
Israel stood.</p>
<p>7:7 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was before
the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and the fat
of the peace offerings, because the brasen altar which Solomon had made
was not able to receive the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and
the fat.</p>
<p>7:8 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all
Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of
Hamath unto the river of Egypt.</p>
<p>7:9 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they kept
the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast seven days.</p>
<p>7:10 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he sent
the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the
goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to Solomon, and to
Israel his people.</p>
<p>7:11 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king’s
house: and all that came into Solomon’s heart to make in the house of
the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously effected.</p>
<p>7:12 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him, I
have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself for an house
of sacrifice.</p>
<p>7:13 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people;</p>
<p>7:14 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways;
then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal
their land.</p>
<p>7:15 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
prayer that is made in this place.</p>
<p>7:16 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be there
perpetually.</p>
<p>7:17 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee, and
shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;</p>
<p>7:18 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I
have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee
a man to be ruler in Israel.</p>
<p>7:19 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my
commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other
gods, and worship them;</p>
<p>7:20 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name,
will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a proverb and a
byword among all nations.</p>
<p>7:21 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every
one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath the LORD done
thus unto this land, and unto this house?</p>
<p>7:22 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of
their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, and
laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and served them: therefore
hath he brought all this evil upon them.</p>
