– 撒母耳记上(1 3:1 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before
Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
open vision.</h4>
<p>3:2 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his
place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</p>
<p>3:3 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where
the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</p>
<p>3:4 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</p>
<p>3:5 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.
And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and lay down.</p>
<p>3:6 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went
to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And he answered, I
called not, my son; lie down again.</p>
<p>3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the
LORD yet revealed unto him.</p>
<p>3:8 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and
went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And Eli
perceived that the LORD had called the child.</p>
<p>3:9 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if
he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.
So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</p>
<p>3:10 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
heareth.</p>
<p>3:11 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall
tingle.</p>
<p>3:12 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</p>
<p>3:13 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the
iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he
restrained them not.</p>
<p>3:14 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering
for ever.</p>
<p>3:15 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</p>
<p>3:16 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
answered, Here am I.</p>
<p>3:17 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also,
if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto
thee.</p>
<p>3:18 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he
said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</p>
<p>3:19 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of
his words fall to the ground.</p>
<p>3:20 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
established to be a prophet of the LORD.</p>
<p>3:21 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</p>
