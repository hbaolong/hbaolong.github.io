以斯帖记(Esther) – 第 9章 ( 本篇共有 10章 )</h4>
<p>9:1 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his decree
drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the
Jews hoped to have power over them, (though it was turned to the
contrary, that the Jews had rule over them that hated them;)</p>
<p>9:2 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout
all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought
their hurt: and no man could withstand them; for the fear of them fell
upon all people.</p>
<p>9:3 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and the
deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews; because the fear of
Mordecai fell upon them.</p>
<p>9:4 For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out
throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed greater and
greater.</p>
<p>9:5 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would unto
those that hated them.</p>
<p>9:6 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
hundred men.</p>
<p>9:7 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,</p>
<p>9:8 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,</p>
<p>9:9 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,</p>
<p>9:10 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.</p>
<p>9:11 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
palace was brought before the king.</p>
<p>9:12 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain and
destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the ten sons of
Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? now what
is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: or what is thy request
further? and it shall be done.</p>
<p>9:13 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to
the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according unto this
day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows.</p>
<p>9:14 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.</p>
<p>9:15 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together
on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three hundred men
at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their hand.</p>
<p>9:16 But the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces gathered
themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest from their
enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five thousand, but they laid
not their hands on the prey,</p>
<p>9:17 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth
day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and
gladness.</p>
<p>9:18 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the
fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day of feasting and
gladness.</p>
<p>9:19 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and
feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions one to another.</p>
<p>9:20 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, both nigh and
far,</p>
<p>9:21 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the
fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the same,
yearly,</p>
<p>9:22 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and the
month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and from mourning
into a good day: that they should make them days of feasting and joy,
and of sending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor.</p>
<p>9:23 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mordecai
had written unto them;</p>
<p>9:24 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast
Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to destroy them;</p>
<p>9:25 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters
that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return
upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the
gallows.</p>
<p>9:26 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which they had
seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto them,</p>
<p>9:27 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed, and
upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail,
that they would keep these two days according to their writing, and
according to their appointed time every year;</p>
<p>9:28 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
every generation, every family, every province, and every city; and that
these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews, nor the
memorial of them perish from their seed.</p>
<p>9:29 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the
Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of
Purim.</p>
<p>9:30 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty
and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and
truth,</p>
<p>9:31 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed,
according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had enjoined them,
and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the matters
of the fastings and their cry.</p>
<p>9:32 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
it was written in the book.</p>
