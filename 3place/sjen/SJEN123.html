第 2章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with
one accord in one place.</p>
<p>2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing
mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</p>
<p>2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and
it sat upon each of them.</p>
<p>2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak
with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</p>
<p>2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of
every nation under heaven.</p>
<p>2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
language.</p>
<p>2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,
Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?</p>
<p>2:8 And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were
born?</p>
<p>2:9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in
Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,</p>
<p>2:10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya
about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,</p>
<p>2:11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the
wonderful works of God.</p>
<p>2:12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to
another, What meaneth this?</p>
<p>2:13 Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.</p>
<p>2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and
said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem, be
this known unto you, and hearken to my words:</p>
<p>2:15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the
third hour of the day.</p>
<p>2:16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel;</p>
<p>2:17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will
pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters
shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men
shall dream dreams:</p>
<p>2:18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in
those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy:</p>
<p>2:19 And I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth
beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</p>
<p>2:20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
before that great and notable day of the Lord come:</p>
<p>2:21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name
of the Lord shall be saved.</p>
<p>2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man
approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God
did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:</p>
<p>2:23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified
and slain:</p>
<p>2:24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death:
because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</p>
<p>2:25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always
before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be
moved:</p>
<p>2:26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover
also my flesh shall rest in hope:</p>
<p>2:27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou
suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</p>
<p>2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me
full of joy with thy countenance.</p>
<p>2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch
David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us
unto this day.</p>
<p>2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with
an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,
he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne;</p>
<p>2:31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that
his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</p>
<p>2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</p>
<p>2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having
received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth
this, which ye now see and hear.</p>
<p>2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith
himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</p>
<p>2:35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.</p>
<p>2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God
hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and
Christ.</p>
<p>2:37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and
said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what
shall we do?</p>
<p>2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of
you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all
that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.</p>
<p>2:40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying,
Save yourselves from this untoward generation.</p>
<p>2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the
same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</p>
<p>2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and
fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</p>
<p>2:43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were
done by the apostles.</p>
<p>2:44 And all that believed were together, and had all things
common;</p>
<p>2:45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all
men, as every man had need.</p>
<p>2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and
breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and
singleness of heart,</p>
<p>2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the
Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.</p>
