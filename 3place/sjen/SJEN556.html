– 历代记上(1 29:1 Furthermore David the king said unto all the
congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young
and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but
for the LORD God.</h4>
<p>29:2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of
silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron,
and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set,
glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious
stones, and marble stones in abundance.</p>
<p>29:3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have
given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared
for the holy house,</p>
<p>29:4 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the
houses withal:</p>
<p>29:5 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of
silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of
artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day
unto the LORD?</p>
<p>29:6 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers
of the king’s work, offered willingly,</p>
<p>29:7 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand
talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred
thousand talents of iron.</p>
<p>29:8 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the
Gershonite.</p>
<p>29:9 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David
the king also rejoiced with great joy.</p>
<p>29:10 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever
and ever.</p>
<p>29:11 Thine, O LORD, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in
the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O LORD, and thou art exalted
as head above all.</p>
<p>29:12 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over
all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand it is to
make great, and to give strength unto all.</p>
<p>29:13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
name.</p>
<p>29:14 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of
thine own have we given thee.</p>
<p>29:15 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none
abiding.</p>
<p>29:16 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is all thine
own.</p>
<p>29:17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine heart I
have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy
thy people, which are present here, to offer willingly unto thee.</p>
<p>29:18 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy
people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</p>
<p>29:19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these
things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made
provision.</p>
<p>29:20 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your
God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and
bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</p>
<p>29:21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand
bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink
offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</p>
<p>29:22 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great
gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time,
and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be
priest.</p>
<p>29:23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</p>
<p>29:24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</p>
<p>29:25 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not been on any
king before him in Israel.</p>
<p>29:26 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</p>
<p>29:27 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven
years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>29:28 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and
honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>29:29 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan
the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</p>
<p>29:30 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over
him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</p>
