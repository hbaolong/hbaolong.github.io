以赛亚书(Isaiah) – 第 42章 ( 本篇共有 66章 )</h4>
<p>42:1 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment
to the Gentiles.</p>
<p>42:2 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard
in the street.</p>
<p>42:3 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he
not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</p>
<p>42:4 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment
in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</p>
<p>42:5 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which
cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and
spirit to them that walk therein:</p>
<p>42:6 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
people, for a light of the Gentiles;</p>
<p>42:7 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</p>
<p>42:8 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to
another, neither my praise to graven images.</p>
<p>42:9 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I
declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</p>
<p>42:10 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the
isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</p>
<p>42:11 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock
sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</p>
<p>42:12 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in
the islands.</p>
<p>42:13 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail
against his enemies.</p>
<p>42:14 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy
and devour at once.</p>
<p>42:15 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the
pools.</p>
<p>42:16 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light
before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto
them, and not forsake them.</p>
<p>42:17 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our
gods.</p>
<p>42:18 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</p>
<p>42:19 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD’s
servant?</p>
<p>42:20 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
but he heareth not.</p>
<p>42:21 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness’ sake; he will
magnify the law, and make it honourable.</p>
<p>42:22 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey,
and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</p>
<p>42:23 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
for the time to come?</p>
<p>42:24 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not
the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not walk in his
ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</p>
<p>42:25 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and
the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he
knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</p>
