第 19章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>19:1 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount
Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.</p>
<p>19:2 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
from him unto her father’s house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four
whole months.</p>
<p>19:3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a
couple of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when
the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</p>
<p>19:4 And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he
abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged
there.</p>
<p>19:5 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in
the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said
unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and
afterward go your way.</p>
<p>19:6 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together:
for the damsel’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee,
and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.</p>
<p>19:7 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:
therefore he lodged there again.</p>
<p>19:8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart:
and the damsel’s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they
tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.</p>
<p>19:9 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
his servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him,
Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all night:
behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart may be
merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou mayest go
home.</p>
<p>19:10 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there
were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.</p>
<p>19:11 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in into
this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</p>
<p>19:12 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we
will pass over to Gibeah.</p>
<p>19:13 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one
of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</p>
<p>19:14 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.</p>
<p>19:15 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah:
and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for there
was no man that took them into his house to lodging.</p>
<p>19:16 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in
Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.</p>
<p>19:17 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and
whence comest thou?</p>
<p>19:18 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah toward
the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went to
Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD; and there
is no man that receiveth me to house.</p>
<p>19:19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young
man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.</p>
<p>19:20 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy
wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.</p>
<p>19:21 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</p>
<p>19:22 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and beat
at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man, saying,
Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may know
him.</p>
<p>19:23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;
seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.</p>
<p>19:24 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I
will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth
good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.</p>
<p>19:25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and
abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to
spring, they let her go.</p>
<p>19:26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at
the door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light.</p>
<p>19:27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his
concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were
upon the threshold.</p>
<p>19:28 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and
gat him unto his place.</p>
<p>19:29 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into
twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</p>
<p>19:30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out
of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and
speak your minds.</p>
