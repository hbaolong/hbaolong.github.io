– 列王记下(2 18:1 Now it came to pass in the third year of Hoshea son of
Elah king of Israel, that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began
to reign.</h4>
<p>18:2 Twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign; and he
reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was
Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.</p>
<p>18:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
according to all that David his father did.</p>
<p>18:4 He removed the high places, and brake the images, and cut down
the groves, and brake in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made:
for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it: and
he called it Nehushtan.</p>
<p>18:5 He trusted in the LORD God of Israel; so that after him was none
like him among all the kings of Judah, nor any that were before him.</p>
<p>18:6 For he clave to the LORD, and departed not from following him,
but kept his commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p>18:7 And the LORD was with him; and he prospered whithersoever he
went forth: and he rebelled against the king of Assyria, and served him
not.</p>
<p>18:8 He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza, and the borders
thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.</p>
<p>18:9 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which
was the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel, that
Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria, and besieged
it.</p>
<p>18:10 And at the end of three years they took it: even in the sixth
year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hoshea king of Israel,
Samaria was taken.</p>
<p>18:11 And the king of Assyria did carry away Israel unto Assyria, and
put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities
of the Medes:</p>
<p>18:12 Because they obeyed not the voice of the LORD their God, but
transgressed his covenant, and all that Moses the servant of the LORD
commanded, and would not hear them, nor do them.</p>
<p>18:13 Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah did Sennacherib
king of Assyria come up against all the fenced cities of Judah, and took
them.</p>
<p>18:14 And Hezekiah king of Judah sent to the king of Assyria to
Lachish, saying, I have offended; return from me: that which thou
puttest on me will I bear. And the king of Assyria appointed unto
Hezekiah king of Judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty
talents of gold.</p>
<p>18:15 And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the
house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s house.</p>
<p>18:16 At that time did Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of
the temple of the LORD, and from the pillars which Hezekiah king of
Judah had overlaid, and gave it to the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>18:17 And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh
from Lachish to king Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And
they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they
came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway
of the fuller’s field.</p>
<p>18:18 And when they had called to the king, there came out to them
Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the household, and Shebna the
scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the recorder.</p>
<p>18:19 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this
wherein thou trustest?</p>
<p>18:20 Thou sayest, (but they are but vain words,) I have counsel and
strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest
against me?</p>
<p>18:21 Now, behold, thou trustest upon the staff of this bruised reed,
even upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and
pierce it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt unto all that trust on him.</p>
<p>18:22 But if ye say unto me, We trust in the LORD our God: is not
that he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken away,
and hath said to Judah and Jerusalem, Ye shall worship before this altar
in Jerusalem?</p>
<p>18:23 Now therefore, I pray thee, give pledges to my lord the king of
Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou be able on
thy part to set riders upon them.</p>
<p>18:24 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
least of my master’s servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for chariots
and for horsemen?</p>
<p>18:25 Am I now come up without the LORD against this place to destroy
it? The LORD said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.</p>
<p>18:26 Then said Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna, and Joah,
unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian
language; for we understand it: and talk not with us in the Jews’
language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.</p>
<p>18:27 But Rabshakeh said unto them, Hath my master sent me to thy
master, and to thee, to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the
men which sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and drink
their own piss with you?</p>
<p>18:28 Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’
language, and spake, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king
of Assyria:</p>
<p>18:29 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall
not be able to deliver you out of his hand:</p>
<p>18:30 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into
the hand of the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>18:31 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me, and then eat
ye every man of his own vine, and every one of his fig tree, and drink
ye every one the waters of his cistern:</p>
<p>18:32 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil
olive and of honey, that ye may live, and not die: and hearken not unto
Hezekiah, when he persuadeth you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.</p>
<p>18:33 Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered at all his land
out of the hand of the king of Assyria?</p>
<p>18:34 Where are the gods of Hamath, and of Arpad? where are the gods
of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah? have they delivered Samaria out of mine
hand?</p>
<p>18:35 Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have
delivered their country out of mine hand, that the LORD should deliver
Jerusalem out of mine hand?</p>
<p>18:36 But the people held their peace, and answered him not a word:
for the king’s commandment was, saying, Answer him not.</p>
<p>18:37 Then came Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, which was over the
household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph the
recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told him the words of
Rabshakeh.</p>
