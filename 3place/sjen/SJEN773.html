第 106章 ( 本篇共有 150章 )</h4>
<p>106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</p>
<p>106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
all his praise?</p>
<p>106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
righteousness at all times.</p>
<p>106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy
people: O visit me with thy salvation;</p>
<p>106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</p>
<p>106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we
have done wickedly.</p>
<p>106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the
sea, even at the Red sea.</p>
<p>106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might
make his mighty power to be known.</p>
<p>106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</p>
<p>106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p>106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
them left.</p>
<p>106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</p>
<p>106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his
counsel:</p>
<p>106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
the desert.</p>
<p>106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
soul.</p>
<p>106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
LORD.</p>
<p>106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the
company of Abiram.</p>
<p>106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
the wicked.</p>
<p>106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten
image.</p>
<p>106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
that eateth grass.</p>
<p>106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
Egypt;</p>
<p>106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
Red sea.</p>
<p>106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest
he should destroy them.</p>
<p>106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
word:</p>
<p>106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
of the LORD.</p>
<p>106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
them in the wilderness:</p>
<p>106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
them in the lands.</p>
<p>106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
sacrifices of the dead.</p>
<p>106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
plague brake in upon them.</p>
<p>106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
plague was stayed.</p>
<p>106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
generations for evermore.</p>
<p>106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
ill with Moses for their sakes:</p>
<p>106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
with his lips.</p>
<p>106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
commanded them:</p>
<p>106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their
works.</p>
<p>106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</p>
<p>106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
devils,</p>
<p>106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the
land was polluted with blood.</p>
<p>106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
whoring with their own inventions.</p>
<p>106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</p>
<p>106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
hated them ruled over them.</p>
<p>106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
subjection under their hand.</p>
<p>106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</p>
<p>106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
cry:</p>
<p>106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
according to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p>106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
captives.</p>
<p>106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</p>
<p>106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.</p>
