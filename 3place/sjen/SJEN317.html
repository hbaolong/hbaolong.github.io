– 第 11章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the
LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt
among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the
camp.</p>
<p>11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
LORD, the fire was quenched.</p>
<p>11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of
the LORD burnt among them.</p>
<p>11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us
flesh to eat?</p>
<p>11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
garlick:</p>
<p>11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside
this manna, before our eyes.</p>
<p>11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
the colour of bdellium.</p>
<p>11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of
it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</p>
<p>11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
upon it.</p>
<p>11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled
greatly; Moses also was displeased.</p>
<p>11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou
layest the burden of all this people upon me?</p>
<p>11:12 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father
beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their
fathers?</p>
<p>11:13 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</p>
<p>11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
heavy for me.</p>
<p>11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my
wretchedness.</p>
<p>11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and
officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</p>
<p>11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they
shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
thyself alone.</p>
<p>11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the
LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in
Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</p>
<p>11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
ten days, nor twenty days;</p>
<p>11:20 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and
it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which
is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of
Egypt?</p>
<p>11:21 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they
may eat a whole month.</p>
<p>11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to
suffice them?</p>
<p>11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD’s hand waxed short?
thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or
not.</p>
<p>11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them
round about the tabernacle.</p>
<p>11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took
of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:
and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they
prophesied, and did not cease.</p>
<p>11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested
upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out
unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</p>
<p>11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
Medad do prophesy in the camp.</p>
<p>11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</p>
<p>11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
that all the LORD’s people were prophets, and that the LORD would put
his spirit upon them!</p>
<p>11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of
Israel.</p>
<p>11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day’s journey
on this side, and as it were a day’s journey on the other side, round
about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the
earth.</p>
<p>11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least
gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves
round about the camp.</p>
<p>11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the
LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</p>
<p>11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
there they buried the people that lusted.</p>
<p>11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
and abode at Hazeroth.</p>
