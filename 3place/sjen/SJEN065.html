出埃及记(Exodus) – 第 15章 ( 本篇共有 40章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the
LORD, and spake, saying, I will sing unto the LORD, for he hath
triumphed gloriously: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.</p>
<p>15:2 The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation:
he is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation; my father’s God, and
I will exalt him.</p>
<p>15:3 The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name.</p>
<p>15:4 Pharaoh’s chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his
chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea.</p>
<p>15:5 The depths have covered them: they sank into the bottom as a
stone.</p>
<p>15:6 Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right
hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</p>
<p>15:7 And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown
them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which
consumed them as stubble.</p>
<p>15:8 And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered
together, the floods stood upright as an heap, and the depths were
congealed in the heart of the sea.</p>
<p>15:9 The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide
the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword,
my hand shall destroy them.</p>
<p>15:10 Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank
as lead in the mighty waters.</p>
<p>15:11 Who is like unto thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like
thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?</p>
<p>15:12 Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed
them.</p>
<p>15:13 Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast
redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy
habitation.</p>
<p>15:14 The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on
the inhabitants of Palestina.</p>
<p>15:15 Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab,
trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall
melt away.</p>
<p>15:16 Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine
arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O
LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased.</p>
<p>15:17 Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of
thine inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee
to dwell in, in the Sanctuary, O LORD, which thy hands have
established.</p>
<p>15:18 The LORD shall reign for ever and ever.</p>
<p>15:19 For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his
horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea
upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of
the sea.</p>
<p>15:20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel
in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with
dances.</p>
<p>15:21 And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath
triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the
sea.</p>
<p>15:22 So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out
into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness,
and found no water.</p>
<p>15:23 And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters
of Marah, for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called
Marah.</p>
<p>15:24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we
drink?</p>
<p>15:25 And he cried unto the LORD; and the LORD shewed him a tree,
which when he had cast into the waters, the waters were made sweet:
there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved
them,</p>
<p>15:26 And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the
LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt
give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none
of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians:
for I am the LORD that healeth thee.</p>
<p>15:27 And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and
threescore and ten palm trees: and they encamped there by the
waters.</p>
