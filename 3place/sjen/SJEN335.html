<p>29:5 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an
atonement for you:</p>

and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their drink
offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet savour, a sacrifice
made by fire unto the LORD.</p>
<p>29:7 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an holy
