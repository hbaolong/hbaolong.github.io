约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 18章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>18:1 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there.
And the land was subdued before them.</p>
<p>18:2 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
which had not yet received their inheritance.</p>
<p>18:3 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your fathers hath
given you?</p>
<p>18:4 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will
send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and describe it
according to the inheritance of them; and they shall come again to
me.</p>
<p>18:5 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide in
their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their
coasts on the north.</p>
<p>18:6 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and bring
the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for you here before
the LORD our God.</p>
<p>18:7 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half the tribe
of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond Jordan on the east,
which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.</p>
<p>18:8 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land, and
describe it, and come again to me, that I may here cast lots for you
before the LORD in Shiloh.</p>
<p>18:9 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it
by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua to the
host at Shiloh.</p>
<p>18:10 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel according to
their divisions.</p>
<p>18:11 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
according to their families: and the coast of their lot came forth
between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.</p>
<p>18:12 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and went up
through the mountains westward; and the goings out thereof were at the
wilderness of Bethaven.</p>
<p>18:13 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side of
Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended to
Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of the nether
Bethhoron.</p>
<p>18:14 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of
the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron southward;
and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim,
a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter.</p>
<p>18:15 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and
the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of waters of
Nephtoah:</p>
<p>18:16 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the valley of
the giants on the north, and descended to the valley of Hinnom, to the
side of Jebusi on the south, and descended to Enrogel,</p>
<p>18:17 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up of
Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben,</p>
<p>18:18 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah northward,
and went down unto Arabah:</p>
<p>18:19 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah
northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north bay of the
salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the south coast.</p>
<p>18:20 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof round
about, according to their families.</p>
<p>18:21 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and the valley
of Keziz,</p>
<p>18:22 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,</p>
<p>18:23 And Avim, and Parah, and Ophrah,</p>
<p>18:24 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with
their villages:</p>
<p>18:25 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,</p>
<p>18:26 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,</p>
<p>18:27 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,</p>
<p>18:28 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of
the children of Benjamin according to their families.</p>
