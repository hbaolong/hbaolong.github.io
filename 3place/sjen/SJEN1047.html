但以理书(Daniel) – 第 8章 ( 本篇共有 12章 )</h4>
<p>8:1 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me
at the first.</p>
<p>8:2 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I
saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</p>
<p>8:3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high;
but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</p>
<p>8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so
that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could
deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became
great.</p>
<p>8:5 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west
on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat
had a notable horn between his eyes.</p>
<p>8:6 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his
power.</p>
<p>8:7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and
there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down
to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could
deliver the ram out of his hand.</p>
<p>8:8 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong,
the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward
the four winds of heaven.</p>
<p>8:9 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the
pleasant land.</p>
<p>8:10 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down
some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped upon
them.</p>
<p>8:11 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by
him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary
was cast down.</p>
<p>8:12 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason
of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it
practised, and prospered.</p>
<p>8:13 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision concerning
the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both
the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</p>
<p>8:14 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</p>
<p>8:15 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision,
and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the
appearance of a man.</p>
<p>8:16 And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of Ulai, which
called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.</p>
<p>8:17 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man:
for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</p>
<p>8:18 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face
toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</p>
<p>8:19 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the
last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall
be.</p>
<p>8:20 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of
Media and Persia.</p>
<p>8:21 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn
that is between his eyes is the first king.</p>
<p>8:22 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.</p>
<p>8:23 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors
are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding
dark sentences, shall stand up.</p>
<p>8:24 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he
shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall
destroy the mighty and the holy people.</p>
<p>8:25 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall
destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but
he shall be broken without hand.</p>
<p>8:26 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is
true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many
days.</p>
<p>8:27 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I
rose up, and did the king’s business; and I was astonished at the
vision, but none understood it.</p>
