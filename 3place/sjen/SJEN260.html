希伯来书(Hebrews) – 第 12章 ( 本篇共有 13章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which
doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is
set before us,</p>
<p>12:2 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who for
the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame,
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.</p>
<p>12:3 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.</p>
<p>12:4 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.</p>
<p>12:5 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as
unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor
faint when thou art rebuked of him:</p>
<p>12:6 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every son
whom he receiveth.</p>
<p>12:7 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons; for
what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</p>
<p>12:8 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
then are ye bastards, and not sons.</p>
<p>12:9 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us,
and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection
unto the Father of spirits, and live?</p>
<p>12:10 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his
holiness.</p>
<p>12:11 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of
righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.</p>
<p>12:12 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
knees;</p>
<p>12:13 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame
be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.</p>
<p>12:14 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
shall see the Lord:</p>
<p>12:15 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest
any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be
defiled;</p>
<p>12:16 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who
for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.</p>
<p>12:17 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited
the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repentance,
though he sought it carefully with tears.</p>
<p>12:18 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and
that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and
tempest,</p>
<p>12:19 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which voice
they that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any
more:</p>
<p>12:20 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so
much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or thrust
through with a dart:</p>
<p>12:21 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly
fear and quake:)</p>
<p>12:22 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the
living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of
angels,</p>
<p>12:23 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirits of
just men made perfect,</p>
<p>12:24 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood
of sprinkling, that speaketh better things than that of Abel.</p>
<p>12:25 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape,
if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:</p>
<p>12:26 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also heaven.</p>
<p>12:27 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things
which cannot be shaken may remain.</p>
<p>12:28 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly
fear:</p>
<p>12:29 For our God is a consuming fire.</p>
