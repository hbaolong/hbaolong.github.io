以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 16章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>16:1 Again the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>16:2 Son of man, cause Jerusalem to know her abominations,</p>
<p>16:3 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD unto Jerusalem; Thy birth and
thy nativity is of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite, and
thy mother an Hittite.</p>
<p>16:4 And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was
not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not
salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</p>
<p>16:5 None eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have
compassion upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field, to the
lothing of thy person, in the day that thou wast born.</p>
<p>16:6 And when I passed by thee, and saw thee polluted in thine own
blood, I said unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live; yea, I said
unto thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live.</p>
<p>16:7 I have caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field, and thou
hast increased and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent
ornaments: thy breasts are fashioned, and thine hair is grown, whereas
thou wast naked and bare.</p>
<p>16:8 Now when I passed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold, thy
time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over thee, and covered
thy nakedness: yea, I sware unto thee, and entered into a covenant with
thee, saith the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine.</p>
<p>16:9 Then washed I thee with water; yea, I throughly washed away thy
blood from thee, and I anointed thee with oil.</p>
<p>16:10 I clothed thee also with broidered work, and shod thee with
badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I covered
thee with silk.</p>
<p>16:11 I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy
hands, and a chain on thy neck.</p>
<p>16:12 And I put a jewel on thy forehead, and earrings in thine ears,
and a beautiful crown upon thine head.</p>
<p>16:13 Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was
of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour,
and honey, and oil: and thou wast exceeding beautiful, and thou didst
prosper into a kingdom.</p>
<p>16:14 And thy renown went forth among the heathen for thy beauty: for
it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put upon thee, saith
the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>16:15 But thou didst trust in thine own beauty, and playedst the
harlot because of thy renown, and pouredst out thy fornications on every
one that passed by; his it was.</p>
<p>16:16 And of thy garments thou didst take, and deckedst thy high
places with divers colours, and playedst the harlot thereupon: the like
things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</p>
<p>16:17 Thou hast also taken thy fair jewels of my gold and of my
silver, which I had given thee, and madest to thyself images of men, and
didst commit whoredom with them,</p>
<p>16:18 And tookest thy broidered garments, and coveredst them: and
thou hast set mine oil and mine incense before them.</p>
<p>16:19 My meat also which I gave thee, fine flour, and oil, and honey,
wherewith I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet
savour: and thus it was, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>16:20 Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou
hast borne unto me, and these hast thou sacrificed unto them to be
devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,</p>
<p>16:21 That thou hast slain my children, and delivered them to cause
them to pass through the fire for them?</p>
<p>16:22 And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms thou hast not
remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked and bare, and
wast polluted in thy blood.</p>
<p>16:23 And it came to pass after all thy wickedness, (woe, woe unto
thee! saith the LORD GOD;)</p>
<p>16:24 That thou hast also built unto thee an eminent place, and hast
made thee an high place in every street.</p>
<p>16:25 Thou hast built thy high place at every head of the way, and
hast made thy beauty to be abhorred, and hast opened thy feet to every
one that passed by, and multiplied thy whoredoms.</p>
<p>16:26 Thou hast also committed fornication with the Egyptians thy
neighbours, great of flesh; and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke
me to anger.</p>
<p>16:27 Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee, and
have diminished thine ordinary food, and delivered thee unto the will of
them that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, which are ashamed
of thy lewd way.</p>
<p>16:28 Thou hast played the whore also with the Assyrians, because
thou wast unsatiable; yea, thou hast played the harlot with them, and
yet couldest not be satisfied.</p>
<p>16:29 Thou hast moreover multiplied thy fornication in the land of
Canaan unto Chaldea; and yet thou wast not satisfied herewith.</p>
<p>16:30 How weak is thine heart, saith the LORD GOD, seeing thou doest
all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;</p>
<p>16:31 In that thou buildest thine eminent place in the head of every
way, and makest thine high place in every street; and hast not been as
an harlot, in that thou scornest hire;</p>
<p>16:32 But as a wife that committeth adultery, which taketh strangers
instead of her husband!</p>
<p>16:33 They give gifts to all whores: but thou givest thy gifts to all
thy lovers, and hirest them, that they may come unto thee on every side
for thy whoredom.</p>
<p>16:34 And the contrary is in thee from other women in thy whoredoms,
whereas none followeth thee to commit whoredoms: and in that thou givest
a reward, and no reward is given unto thee, therefore thou art
contrary.</p>
<p>16:35 Wherefore, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>16:36 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thy filthiness was poured out,
and thy nakedness discovered through thy whoredoms with thy lovers, and
with all the idols of thy abominations, and by the blood of thy
children, which thou didst give unto them;</p>
<p>16:37 Behold, therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou
hast taken pleasure, and all them that thou hast loved, with all them
that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee,
and will discover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy
nakedness.</p>
<p>16:38 And I will judge thee, as women that break wedlock and shed
blood are judged; and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy.</p>
<p>16:39 And I will also give thee into their hand, and they shall throw
down thine eminent place, and shall break down thy high places: they
shall strip thee also of thy clothes, and shall take thy fair jewels,
and leave thee naked and bare.</p>
<p>16:40 They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall
stone thee with stones, and thrust thee through with their swords.</p>
<p>16:41 And they shall burn thine houses with fire, and execute
judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and I will cause thee to
cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any
more.</p>
<p>16:42 So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy
shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet, and will be no more
angry.</p>
<p>16:43 Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but
hast fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will
recompense thy way upon thine head, saith the Lord GOD: and thou shalt
not commit this lewdness above all thine abominations.</p>
<p>16:44 Behold, every one that useth proverbs shall use this proverb
against thee, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</p>
<p>16:45 Thou art thy mother’s daughter, that lotheth her husband and
her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters, which lothed their
husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father
an Amorite.</p>
<p>16:46 And thine elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that
dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister, that dwelleth at thy
right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</p>
<p>16:47 Yet hast thou not walked after their ways, nor done after their
abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast
corrupted more than they in all thy ways.</p>
<p>16:48 As I live, saith the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister hath not done,
she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.</p>
<p>16:49 Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom, pride,
fulness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her
daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and
needy.</p>
<p>16:50 And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me:
therefore I took them away as I saw good.</p>
<p>16:51 Neither hath Samaria committed half of thy sins; but thou hast
multiplied thine abominations more than they, and hast justified thy
sisters in all thine abominations which thou hast done.</p>
<p>16:52 Thou also, which hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame
for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they: they
are more righteous than thou: yea, be thou confounded also, and bear thy
shame, in that thou hast justified thy sisters.</p>
<p>16:53 When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of
Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,
then will I bring again the captivity of thy captives in the midst of
them:</p>
<p>16:54 That thou mayest bear thine own shame, and mayest be confounded
in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.</p>
<p>16:55 When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to
their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their
former estate, then thou and thy daughters shall return to your former
estate.</p>
<p>16:56 For thy sister Sodom was not mentioned by thy mouth in the day
of thy pride,</p>
<p>16:57 Before thy wickedness was discovered, as at the time of thy
reproach of the daughters of Syria, and all that are round about her,
the daughters of the Philistines, which despise thee round about.</p>
<p>16:58 Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, saith the
LORD.</p>
<p>16:59 For thus saith the Lord GOD; I will even deal with thee as thou
hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</p>
<p>16:60 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with thee in the days
of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting
covenant.</p>
<p>16:61 Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou
shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give
them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.</p>
<p>16:62 And I will establish my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know
that I am the LORD:</p>
<p>16:63 That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open
thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee
for all that thou hast done, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
