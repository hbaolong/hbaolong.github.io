– 列王记上(1 14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell
sick.</h4>
<p>14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise
thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee
to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I
should be king over this people.</p>
<p>14:3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of
honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the
child.</p>
<p>14:4 And Jeroboam’s wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and
came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were
set by reason of his age.</p>
<p>14:5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam
cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus
shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she
shall feign herself to be another woman.</p>
<p>14:6 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she
came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why
feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy
tidings.</p>
<p>14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuch
as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my
people Israel,</p>
<p>14:8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it
thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, who kept my
commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only
which was right in mine eyes;</p>
<p>14:9 But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou
hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to
anger, and hast cast me behind thy back:</p>
<p>14:10 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of
Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the
wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and will take away the
remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be
all gone.</p>
<p>14:11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and
him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD
hath spoken it.</p>
<p>14:12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy
feet enter into the city, the child shall die.</p>
<p>14:13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only
of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some
good thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.</p>
<p>14:14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, who
shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.</p>
<p>14:15 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in the
water, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which he gave
to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they
have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.</p>
<p>14:16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam,
who did sin, and who made Israel to sin.</p>
<p>14:17 And Jeroboam’s wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah:
and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died;</p>
<p>14:18 And they buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according
to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant
Ahijah the prophet.</p>
<p>14:19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he
reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the
kings of Israel.</p>
<p>14:20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:
and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>14:21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was
forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen
years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the
tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother’s name was
Naamah an Ammonitess.</p>
<p>14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked
him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that
their fathers had done.</p>
<p>14:23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves,
on every high hill, and under every green tree.</p>
<p>14:24 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did
according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out
before the children of Israel.</p>
<p>14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that
Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem:</p>
<p>14:26 And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and
the treasures of the king’s house; he even took away all: and he took
away all the shields of gold which Solomon had made.</p>
<p>14:27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and
committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the
door of the king’s house.</p>
<p>14:28 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,
that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard
chamber.</p>
<p>14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are
they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
Judah?</p>
<p>14:30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their
days.</p>
<p>14:31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah an
Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
