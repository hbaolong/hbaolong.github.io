第12章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>12:1 Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,
and from thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I
will shew thee:</p>
<p>12:2 And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,
and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>
<p>12:3 And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that
curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be
blessed.</p>
<p>12:4 +
亚伯拉罕是犹太民族和阿拉伯民族的共同祖先。亚伯拉罕，原名亚伯兰，他的父亲是乌尔的皇族祭司。神赐名“亚伯拉罕”意
为“多国之父”；他的妻子“撒莱”改名“撒拉”意为“多国之母”。</p>
<p>So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with
him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of
Haran.</p>
<p>12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother’s son, and
all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had
gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and
into the land of Canaan they came.</p>
<p>12:6 And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto
the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.</p>
<p>12:7 And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I
give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who
appeared unto him.</p>
<p>12:8 And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of
Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the
east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the
name of the LORD.</p>
<p>12:9 And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</p>
<p>12:10 And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into
Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</p>
<p>12:11 And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt,
that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a
fair woman to look upon:</p>
<p>12:12 Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see
thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but
they will save thee alive.</p>
<p>12:13 Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with
me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</p>
<p>12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the
Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</p>
<p>12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before
Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.</p>
<p>12:16 And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and
oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses,
and camels.</p>
<p>12:17 And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues
because of Sarai Abram’s wife.</p>
<p>12:18 And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast
done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</p>
<p>12:19 Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her to
me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</p>
<p>12:20 And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him
away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>
