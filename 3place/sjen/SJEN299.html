启示录(Revelation) – 第 14章 ( 本篇共有 22章 )</h4>
<p>14:1 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with
him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father’s name written
in their foreheads.</p>
<p>14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers
harping with their harps:</p>
<p>14:3 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song
but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from
the earth.</p>
<p>14:4 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth.
These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and
to the Lamb.</p>
<p>14:5 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without
fault before the throne of God.</p>
<p>14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to
every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,</p>
<p>14:7 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and
earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</p>
<p>14:8 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is
fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine
of the wrath of her fornication.</p>
<p>14:9 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If
any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his
forehead, or in his hand,</p>
<p>14:10 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall
be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels,
and in the presence of the Lamb:</p>
<p>14:11 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his
image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.</p>
<p>14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the
commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.</p>
<p>14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the
Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow
them.</p>
<p>14:14 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in
his hand a sharp sickle.</p>
<p>14:15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for
the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is
ripe.</p>
<p>14:16 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth;
and the earth was reaped.</p>
<p>14:17 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he
also having a sharp sickle.</p>
<p>14:18 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over
fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle,
saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine
of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.</p>
<p>14:19 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered
the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath
of God.</p>
<p>14:20 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a
thousand and six hundred furlongs.</p>
