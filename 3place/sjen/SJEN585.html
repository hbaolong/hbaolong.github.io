– 历代记下(2 29:1 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty
years old, and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.</h4>
<p>29:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
according to all that David his father had done.</p>
<p>29:3 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.</p>
<p>29:4 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered them
together into the east street,</p>
<p>29:5 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your fathers, and
carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.</p>
<p>29:6 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil in
the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and have turned
away their faces from the habitation of the LORD, and turned their
backs.</p>
<p>29:7 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the
holy place unto the God of Israel.</p>
<p>29:8 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to hissing,
as ye see with your eyes.</p>
<p>29:9 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and
our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.</p>
<p>29:10 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God of
Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.</p>
<p>29:11 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister unto him,
and burn incense.</p>
<p>29:12 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons of
Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of Jehalelel: and of
the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and Eden the son of Joah:</p>
<p>29:13 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:</p>
<p>29:14 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.</p>
<p>29:15 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the
LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:16 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that they found
in the temple of the LORD into the court of the house of the LORD. And
the Levites took it, to carry it out abroad into the brook Kidron.</p>
<p>29:17 Now they began on the first day of the first month to sanctify,
and on the eighth day of the month came they to the porch of the LORD:
so they sanctified the house of the LORD in eight days; and in the
sixteenth day of the first month they made an end.</p>
<p>29:18 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt offering,
with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread table, with all the
vessels thereof.</p>
<p>29:19 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did cast
away in his transgression, have we prepared and sanctified, and, behold,
they are before the altar of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:20 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:21 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for
the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the priests the sons of
Aaron to offer them on the altar of the LORD.</p>
<p>29:22 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had killed the
rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they killed also the
lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.</p>
<p>29:23 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering before
the king and the congregation; and they laid their hands upon them:</p>
<p>29:24 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all Israel: for the
king commanded that the burnt offering and the sin offering should be
made for all Israel.</p>
<p>29:25 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment of David,
and of Gad the king’s seer, and Nathan the prophet: for so was the
commandment of the LORD by his prophets.</p>
<p>29:26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
priests with the trumpets.</p>
<p>29:27 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD began
also with the trumpets, and with the instruments ordained by David king
of Israel.</p>
<p>29:28 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt offering
was finished.</p>
<p>29:29 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.</p>
<p>29:30 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David, and of
Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness, and they bowed
their heads and worshipped.</p>
<p>29:31 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and thank
offerings into the house of the LORD. And the congregation brought in
sacrifices and thank offerings; and as many as were of a free heart
burnt offerings.</p>
<p>29:32 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and two
hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the LORD.</p>
<p>29:33 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
thousand sheep.</p>
<p>29:34 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did help them,
till the work was ended, and until the other priests had sanctified
themselves: for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify
themselves than the priests.</p>
<p>29:35 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of
the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every burnt offering.
So the service of the house of the LORD was set in order.</p>
<p>29:36 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.</p>
