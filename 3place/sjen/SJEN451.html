– 撒母耳记上(1 26:1 And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying,
Doth not David hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
Jeshimon?</h4>
<p>26:2 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having
three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the
wilderness of Ziph.</p>
<p>26:3 And Saul pitched in the hill of Hachilah, which is before
Jeshimon, by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw that
Saul came after him into the wilderness.</p>
<p>26:4 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was
come in very deed.</p>
<p>26:5 And David arose, and came to the place where Saul had pitched:
and David beheld the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the
captain of his host: and Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched
round about him.</p>
<p>26:6 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to
Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down
with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with
thee.</p>
<p>26:7 So David and Abishai came to the people by night: and, behold,
Saul lay sleeping within the trench, and his spear stuck in the ground
at his bolster: but Abner and the people lay round about him.</p>
<p>26:8 Then said Abishai to David, God hath delivered thine enemy into
thine hand this day: now therefore let me smite him, I pray thee, with
the spear even to the earth at once, and I will not smite him the second
time.</p>
<p>26:9 And David said to Abishai, Destroy him not: for who can stretch
forth his hand against the LORD’s anointed, and be guiltless?</p>
<p>26:10 David said furthermore, As the LORD liveth, the LORD shall
smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall descend into
battle, and perish.</p>
<p>26:11 The LORD forbid that I should stretch forth mine hand against
the LORD’s anointed: but, I pray thee, take thou now the spear that is
at his bolster, and the cruse of water, and let us go.</p>
<p>26:12 So David took the spear and the cruse of water from Saul’s
bolster; and they gat them away, and no man saw it, nor knew it, neither
awaked: for they were all asleep; because a deep sleep from the LORD was
fallen upon them.</p>
<p>26:13 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top of
an hill afar off; a great space being between them:</p>
<p>26:14 And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,
saying, Answerest thou not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art
thou that criest to the king?</p>
<p>26:15 And David said to Abner, Art not thou a valiant man? and who is
like to thee in Israel? wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the
king? for there came one of the people in to destroy the king thy
lord.</p>
<p>26:16 This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the LORD liveth,
ye are worthy to die, because ye have not kept your master, the LORD’s
anointed. And now see where the king’s spear is, and the cruse of water
that was at his bolster.</p>
<p>26:17 And Saul knew David’s voice, and said, Is this thy voice, my
son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.</p>
<p>26:18 And he said, Wherefore doth my lord thus pursue after his
servant? for what have I done? or what evil is in mine hand?</p>
<p>26:19 Now therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words
of his servant. If the LORD have stirred thee up against me, let him
accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they
before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in
the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.</p>
<p>26:20 Now therefore, let not my blood fall to the earth before the
face of the LORD: for the king of Israel is come out to seek a flea, as
when one doth hunt a partridge in the mountains.</p>
<p>26:21 Then said Saul, I have sinned: return, my son David: for I will
no more do thee harm, because my soul was precious in thine eyes this
day: behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly.</p>
<p>26:22 And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! and let
one of the young men come over and fetch it.</p>
<p>26:23 The LORD render to every man his righteousness and his
faithfulness; for the LORD delivered thee into my hand to day, but I
would not stretch forth mine hand against the LORD’s anointed.</p>
<p>26:24 And, behold, as thy life was much set by this day in mine eyes,
so let my life be much set by in the eyes of the LORD, and let him
deliver me out of all tribulation.</p>
<p>26:25 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be thou, my son David: thou
shalt both do great things, and also shalt still prevail. So David went
on his way, and Saul returned to his place.</p>
