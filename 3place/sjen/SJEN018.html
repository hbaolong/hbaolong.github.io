第18章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>18:1 And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he
sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</p>
<p>18:2 And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by
him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and
bowed himself toward the ground,</p>
<p>18:3 And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass
not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>
<p>18:4 Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet,
and rest yourselves under the tree:</p>
<p>18:5 And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts;
after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant.
And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>
<p>18:6 And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make
ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon
the hearth.</p>
<p>18:7 And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and
good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>
<p>18:8 And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed,
and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they
did eat.</p>
<p>18:9 And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,
Behold, in the tent.</p>
<p>18:10 And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the
time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard
it in the tent door, which was behind him.</p>
<p>18:11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it
ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p>
<p>18:12 Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am
waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</p>
<p>18:13 And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,
saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</p>
<p>18:14 Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I
will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall
have a son.</p>
<p>18:15 Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.
And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>
<p>18:16 And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and
Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</p>
<p>18:17 And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I
do;</p>
<p>18:18 Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty
nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</p>
<p>18:19 For I know him, that he will command his children and his
household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do
justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he
hath spoken of him.</p>
<p>18:20 And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is
great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>
<p>18:21 I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether
according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will
know.</p>
<p>18:22 And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward
Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</p>
<p>18:23 And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the
righteous with the wicked?</p>
<p>18:24 Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt
thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that
are therein?</p>
<p>18:25 That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the
righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the
wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do
right?</p>
<p>18:26 And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within
the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</p>
<p>18:27 And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me
to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:</p>
<p>18:28 Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt
thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there
forty and five, I will not destroy it.</p>
<p>18:29 And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there
shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s
sake.</p>
<p>18:30 And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will
speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I
will not do it, if I find thirty there.</p>
<p>18:31 And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the
LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I
will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.</p>
<p>18:32 And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak yet
but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I
will not destroy it for ten’s sake.</p>
<p>18:33 And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing
with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>
