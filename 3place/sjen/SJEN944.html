耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 10章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>10:1 Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of
Israel:</p>
<p>10:2 Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be
not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at
them.</p>
<p>10:3 For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree
out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the
axe.</p>
<p>10:4 They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with
nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p>
<p>10:5 They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must
needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they
cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</p>
<p>10:6 Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art
great, and thy name is great in might.</p>
<p>10:7 Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it
appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in
all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</p>
<p>10:8 But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a
doctrine of vanities.</p>
<p>10:9 Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold
from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder:
blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning
men.</p>
<p>10:10 But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an
everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations
shall not be able to abide his indignation.</p>
<p>10:11 Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the
heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from
under these heavens.</p>
<p>10:12 He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the
world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his
discretion.</p>
<p>10:13 When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in
the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the
earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out
of his treasures.</p>
<p>10:14 Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is
confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and
there is no breath in them.</p>
<p>10:15 They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their
visitation they shall perish.</p>
<p>10:16 The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of
all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts
is his name.</p>
<p>10:17 Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the
fortress.</p>
<p>10:18 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the
inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they
may find it so.</p>
<p>10:19 Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly
this is a grief, and I must bear it.</p>
<p>10:20 My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my
children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to
stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</p>
<p>10:21 For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the
LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be
scattered.</p>
<p>10:22 Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion
out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a
den of dragons.</p>
<p>10:23 O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not
in man that walketh to direct his steps.</p>
<p>10:24 O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest
thou bring me to nothing.</p>
<p>10:25 Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon
the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob,
and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation
desolate.</p>
