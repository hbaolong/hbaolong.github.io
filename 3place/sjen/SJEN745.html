78章 ( 本篇共有 150章 )</h4>
<p>78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words
of my mouth.</p>
<p>78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of
old:</p>
<p>78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.</p>
<p>78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his
wonderful works that he hath done.</p>
<p>78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in
Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known
to their children:</p>
<p>78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their
children:</p>
<p>78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works
of God, but keep his commandments:</p>
<p>78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose
spirit was not stedfast with God.</p>
<p>78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned
back in the day of battle.</p>
<p>78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
law;</p>
<p>78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed
them.</p>
<p>78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p>
<p>78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
made the waters to stand as an heap.</p>
<p>78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night
with a light of fire.</p>
<p>78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
out of the great depths.</p>
<p>78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
run down like rivers.</p>
<p>78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High
in the wilderness.</p>
<p>78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
lust.</p>
<p>78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table
in the wilderness?</p>
<p>78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his
people?</p>
<p>78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;</p>
<p>78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
salvation:</p>
<p>78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
doors of heaven,</p>
<p>78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
of the corn of heaven.</p>
<p>78:25 Man did eat angels’ food: he sent them meat to the full.</p>
<p>78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
he brought in the south wind.</p>
<p>78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
like as the sand of the sea:</p>
<p>78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
their habitations.</p>
<p>78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
own desire;</p>
<p>78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
was yet in their mouths,</p>
<p>78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
and smote down the chosen men of Israel.</p>
<p>78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
wondrous works.</p>
<p>78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
in trouble.</p>
<p>78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
enquired early after God.</p>
<p>78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
their redeemer.</p>
<p>78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
lied unto him with their tongues.</p>
<p>78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
stedfast in his covenant.</p>
<p>78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did
not stir up all his wrath.</p>
<p>78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth
away, and cometh not again.</p>
<p>78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
in the desert!</p>
<p>78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One
of Israel.</p>
<p>78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
them from the enemy.</p>
<p>78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
field of Zoan:</p>
<p>78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
they could not drink.</p>
<p>78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
and frogs, which destroyed them.</p>
<p>78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
labour unto the locust.</p>
<p>78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
with frost.</p>
<p>78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
hot thunderbolts.</p>
<p>78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.</p>
<p>78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;</p>
<p>78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
strength in the tabernacles of Ham:</p>
<p>78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them
in the wilderness like a flock.</p>
<p>78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea
overwhelmed their enemies.</p>
<p>78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.</p>
<p>78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their
tents.</p>
<p>78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
his testimonies:</p>
<p>78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p>
<p>78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p>
<p>78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
Israel:</p>
<p>78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
placed among men;</p>
<p>78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
the enemy’s hand.</p>
<p>78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with
his inheritance.</p>
<p>78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
given to marriage.</p>
<p>78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
lamentation.</p>
<p>78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man
that shouteth by reason of wine.</p>
<p>78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
perpetual reproach.</p>
<p>78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the
tribe of Ephraim:</p>
<p>78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he
loved.</p>
<p>78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
which he hath established for ever.</p>
<p>78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
sheepfolds:</p>
<p>78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed
Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p>
<p>78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p>
