申命记(Deuteronomy) – 第 21章 ( 本篇共有 34章 )</h4>
<p>21:1 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath
slain him:</p>
<p>21:2 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall
measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain:</p>
<p>21:3 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain man,
even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which hath not been
wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke;</p>
<p>21:4 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a
rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall strike off the
heifer’s neck there in the valley:</p>
<p>21:5 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the
LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name
of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke
be tried:</p>
<p>21:6 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain
man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the
valley:</p>
<p>21:7 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this
blood, neither have our eyes seen it.</p>
<p>21:8 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of Israel’s charge.
And the blood shall be forgiven them.</p>
<p>21:9 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the
LORD.</p>
<p>21:10 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the
LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou hast taken
them captive,</p>
<p>21:11 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;</p>
<p>21:12 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house; and she shall
shave her head, and pare her nails;</p>
<p>21:13 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her,
and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her mother a
full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her, and be her
husband, and she shall be thy wife.</p>
<p>21:14 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou
shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all
for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her, because thou hast
humbled her.</p>
<p>21:15 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and
they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the
firstborn son be hers that was hated:</p>
<p>21:16 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that which
he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved firstborn before
the son of the hated, which is indeed the firstborn:</p>
<p>21:17 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the
firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath: for he is
the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.</p>
<p>21:18 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not
obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when
they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them:</p>
<p>21:19 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring
him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place;</p>
<p>21:20 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is
stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton,
and a drunkard.</p>
<p>21:21 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that
he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall
hear, and fear.</p>
<p>21:22 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to
be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:</p>
<p>21:23 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou
shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is accursed
of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD thy God giveth
thee for an inheritance.</p>
