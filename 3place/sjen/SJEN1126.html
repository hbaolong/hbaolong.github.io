马太福音(Matthew) – 第 8章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>8:1 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
followed him.</p>
<p>8:2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,
if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</p>
<p>8:3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be
thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</p>
<p>8:4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way,
shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for
a testimony unto them.</p>
<p>8:5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a
centurion, beseeching him,</p>
<p>8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
grievously tormented.</p>
<p>8:7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.</p>
<p>8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou
shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant
shall be healed.</p>
<p>8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I
say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh;
and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</p>
<p>8:10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no,
not in Israel.</p>
<p>8:11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,
and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven.</p>
<p>8:12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>8:13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast
believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the
selfsame hour.</p>
<p>8:14 And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s
mother laid, and sick of a fever.</p>
<p>8:15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose,
and ministered unto them.</p>
<p>8:16 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and
healed all that were sick:</p>
<p>8:17 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
sicknesses.</p>
<p>8:18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
commandment to depart unto the other side.</p>
<p>8:19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</p>
<p>8:20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of
the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his
head.</p>
<p>8:21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me
first to go and bury my father.</p>
<p>8:22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their
dead.</p>
<p>8:23 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
him.</p>
<p>8:24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</p>
<p>8:25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save
us: we perish.</p>
<p>8:26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a
great calm.</p>
<p>8:27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that
even the winds and the sea obey him!</p>
<p>8:28 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the
Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the
tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.</p>
<p>8:29 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us before
the time?</p>
<p>8:30 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine
feeding.</p>
<p>8:31 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer
us to go away into the herd of swine.</p>
<p>8:32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran
violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the
waters.</p>
<p>8:33 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city,
and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the
devils.</p>
<p>8:34 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their
coasts.</p>
