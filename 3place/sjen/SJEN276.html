利未记(Leviticus) – 第 26章 ( 本篇共有 27章 )</h4>
<p>26:1 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you up
a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of stone in your
land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD your God.</p>
<p>26:2 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am the
LORD.</p>
<p>26:3 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do
them;</p>
<p>26:4 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall
yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their
fruit.</p>
<p>26:5 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the vintage
shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat your bread to the
full, and dwell in your land safely.</p>
<p>26:6 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land,
neither shall the sword go through your land.</p>
<p>26:7 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you
by the sword.</p>
<p>26:8 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall before you
by the sword.</p>
<p>26:9 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.</p>
<p>26:10 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
the new.</p>
<p>26:11 And I will set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not
abhor you.</p>
<p>26:12 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
be my people.</p>
<p>26:13 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the land
of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have broken the
bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.</p>
<p>26:14 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
commandments;</p>
<p>26:15 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but that ye break
my covenant:</p>
<p>26:16 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you
terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes,
and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your
enemies shall eat it.</p>
<p>26:17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain
before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye
shall flee when none pursueth you.</p>
<p>26:18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
will punish you seven times more for your sins.</p>
<p>26:19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:</p>
<p>26:20 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall
not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their
fruits.</p>
<p>26:21 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;
I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your
sins.</p>
<p>26:22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and
your high ways shall be desolate.</p>
<p>26:23 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
walk contrary unto me;</p>
<p>26:24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you
yet seven times for your sins.</p>
<p>26:25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the
quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your
cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered
into the hand of the enemy.</p>
<p>26:26 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall
bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again
by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be satisfied.</p>
<p>26:27 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
contrary unto me;</p>
<p>26:28 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even I,
will chastise you seven times for your sins.</p>
<p>26:29 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
daughters shall ye eat.</p>
<p>26:30 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my soul
shall abhor you.</p>
<p>26:31 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet
odours.</p>
<p>26:32 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.</p>
<p>26:33 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities
waste.</p>
<p>26:34 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
desolate, and ye be in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land
rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</p>
<p>26:35 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.</p>
<p>26:36 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a
faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound
of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from
a sword; and they shall fall when none pursueth.</p>
<p>26:37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a
sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before
your enemies.</p>
<p>26:38 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
enemies shall eat you up.</p>
<p>26:39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity
in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers
shall they pine away with them.</p>
<p>26:40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their
fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that
also they have walked contrary unto me;</p>
<p>26:41 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised
hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their
iniquity:</p>
<p>26:42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember;
and I will remember the land.</p>
<p>26:43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept
of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised
my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</p>
<p>26:44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to
destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the
LORD their God.</p>
<p>26:45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of
the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</p>
<p>26:46 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand
of Moses.</p>
