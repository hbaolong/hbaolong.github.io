以赛亚书(Isaiah) – 第 28章 ( 本篇共有 66章 )</h4>
<p>28:1 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of the fat
valleys of them that are overcome with wine!</p>
<p>28:2 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a
tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters
overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.</p>
<p>28:3 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
under feet:</p>
<p>28:4 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat valley,
shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit before the summer;
which when he that looketh upon it seeth, while it is yet in his hand he
eateth it up.</p>
<p>28:5 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and
for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,</p>
<p>28:6 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.</p>
<p>28:7 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink
are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong
drink, they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through
strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.</p>
<p>28:8 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there
is no place clean.</p>
<p>28:9 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and drawn from
the breasts.</p>
<p>28:10 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:</p>
<p>28:11 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
this people.</p>
<p>28:12 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.</p>
<p>28:13 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and
there a little; that they might go, and fall backward, and be broken,
and snared, and taken.</p>
<p>28:14 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that rule
this people which is in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>28:15 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass
through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge,
and under falsehood have we hid ourselves:</p>
<p>28:16 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure
foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.</p>
<p>28:17 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the
waters shall overflow the hiding place.</p>
<p>28:18 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall
pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.</p>
<p>28:19 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night: and it shall
be a vexation only to understand the report.</p>
<p>28:20 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.</p>
<p>28:21 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange
work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.</p>
<p>28:22 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a consumption, even
determined upon the whole earth.</p>
<p>28:23 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my
speech.</p>
<p>28:24 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break
the clods of his ground?</p>
<p>28:25 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast
abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the principal
wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their place?</p>
<p>28:26 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach
him.</p>
<p>28:27 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches
are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a rod.</p>
<p>28:28 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing
it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it with his
horsemen.</p>
<p>28:29 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.</p>
