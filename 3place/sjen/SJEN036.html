第36章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>36:1 Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.</p>
<p>36:2 Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the
daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the
daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;</p>
<p>36:3 And Bashemath Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.</p>
<p>36:4 And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;</p>
<p>36:5 And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the
sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.</p>
<p>36:6 And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and
all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his beasts, and
all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan; and went into
the country from the face of his brother Jacob.</p>
<p>36:7 For their riches were more than that they might dwell together;
and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them because of
their cattle.</p>
<p>36:8 Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.</p>
<p>36:9 And these are the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites
in mount Seir:</p>
<p>36:10 These are the names of Esau’s sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah the
wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.</p>
<p>36:11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and
Kenaz.</p>
<p>36:12 And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau’s son; and she bare to
Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau’s wife.</p>
<p>36:13 And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,
and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.</p>
<p>36:14 And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the
daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam,
and Korah.</p>
<p>36:15 These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the
firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke
Kenaz,</p>
<p>36:16 Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes
that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons of
Adah.</p>
<p>36:17 And these are the sons of Reuel Esau’s son; duke Nahath, duke
Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel
in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.</p>
<p>36:18 And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau’s wife; duke Jeush,
duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah
the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.</p>
<p>36:19 These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their
dukes.</p>
<p>36:20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;
Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,</p>
<p>36:21 And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the
Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.</p>
<p>36:22 And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s
sister was Timna.</p>
<p>36:23 And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath, and
Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.</p>
<p>36:24 And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah: this
was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the
asses of Zibeon his father.</p>
<p>36:25 And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah the
daughter of Anah.</p>
<p>36:26 And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and
Ithran, and Cheran.</p>
<p>36:27 The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and
Akan.</p>
<p>36:28 The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.</p>
<p>36:29 These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke
Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,</p>
<p>36:30 Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that
came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.</p>
<p>36:31 And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,
before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.</p>
<p>36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his
city was Dinhabah.</p>
<p>36:33 And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in
his stead.</p>
<p>36:34 And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>36:35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian
in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was
Avith.</p>
<p>36:36 And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>36:37 And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in
his stead.</p>
<p>36:38 And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>36:39 And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his
stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was
Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.</p>
<p>36:40 And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,
according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke
Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,</p>
<p>36:41 Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,</p>
<p>36:42 Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,</p>
<p>36:43 Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according
to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is Esau the
father of the Edomites.</p>
