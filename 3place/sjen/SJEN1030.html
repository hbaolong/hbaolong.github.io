以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 39章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>39:1 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus
saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince
of Meshech and Tubal:</p>
<p>39:2 And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of thee,
and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and will bring thee
upon the mountains of Israel:</p>
<p>39:3 And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause
thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.</p>
<p>39:4 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy
bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee unto the
ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of the field to be
devoured.</p>
<p>39:5 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith
the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>39:6 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>39:7 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more: and the
heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in Israel.</p>
<p>39:8 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this is
the day whereof I have spoken.</p>
<p>39:9 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and
shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the
bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves, and the spears,
and they shall burn them with fire seven years:</p>
<p>39:10 So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire:
and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and rob those that robbed
them, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>39:11 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto
Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on
the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers: and
there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude: and they shall call it
The valley of Hamongog.</p>
<p>39:12 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
that they may cleanse the land.</p>
<p>39:13 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall
be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith the Lord
GOD.</p>
<p>39:14 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain upon the
face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of seven months shall
they search.</p>
<p>39:15 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth a
man’s bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the buriers have
buried it in the valley of Hamongog.</p>
<p>39:16 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they
cleanse the land.</p>
<p>39:17 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto every
feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves,
and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I do
sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel,
that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.</p>
<p>39:18 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of
the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of bullocks,
all of them fatlings of Bashan.</p>
<p>39:19 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye
be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.</p>
<p>39:20 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>39:21 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid
upon them.</p>
<p>39:22 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
from that day and forward.</p>
<p>39:23 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against me,
therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their
enemies: so fell they all by the sword.</p>
<p>39:24 According to their uncleanness and according to their
transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from them.</p>
<p>39:25 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel, and
will be jealous for my holy name;</p>
<p>39:26 After that they have borne their shame, and all their
trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they dwelt
safely in their land, and none made them afraid.</p>
<p>39:27 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight
of many nations;</p>
<p>39:28 Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which caused
them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I have gathered
them unto their own land, and have left none of them any more there.</p>
<p>39:29 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
