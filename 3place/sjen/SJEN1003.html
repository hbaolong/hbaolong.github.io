以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 12章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 The word of the LORD also came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>12:2 Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house,
which have eyes to see, and see not; they have ears to hear, and hear
not: for they are a rebellious house.</p>
<p>12:3 Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for removing, and
remove by day in their sight; and thou shalt remove from thy place to
another place in their sight: it may be they will consider, though they
be a rebellious house.</p>
<p>12:4 Then shalt thou bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as
stuff for removing: and thou shalt go forth at even in their sight, as
they that go forth into captivity.</p>
<p>12:5 Dig thou through the wall in their sight, and carry out
thereby.</p>
<p>12:6 In their sight shalt thou bear it upon thy shoulders, and carry
it forth in the twilight: thou shalt cover thy face, that thou see not
the ground: for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.</p>
<p>12:7 And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by
day, as stuff for captivity, and in the even I digged through the wall
with mine hand; I brought it forth in the twilight, and I bare it upon
my shoulder in their sight.</p>
<p>12:8 And in the morning came the word of the LORD unto me,
saying,</p>
<p>12:9 Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the rebellious house,
said unto thee, What doest thou?</p>
<p>12:10 Say thou unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; This burden
concerneth the prince in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel that are
among them.</p>
<p>12:11 Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done
unto them: they shall remove and go into captivity.</p>
<p>12:12 And the prince that is among them shall bear upon his shoulder
in the twilight, and shall go forth: they shall dig through the wall to
carry out thereby: he shall cover his face, that he see not the ground
with his eyes.</p>
<p>12:13 My net also will I spread upon him, and he shall be taken in my
snare: and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet
shall he not see it, though he shall die there.</p>
<p>12:14 And I will scatter toward every wind all that are about him to
help him, and all his bands; and I will draw out the sword after
them.</p>
<p>12:15 And they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall scatter
them among the nations, and disperse them in the countries.</p>
<p>12:16 But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the
famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their
abominations among the heathen whither they come; and they shall know
that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>12:17 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p>12:18 Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking, and drink thy water
with trembling and with carefulness;</p>
<p>12:19 And say unto the people of the land, Thus saith the Lord GOD of
the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and of the land of Israel; They shall eat
their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment,
that her land may be desolate from all that is therein, because of the
violence of all them that dwell therein.</p>
<p>12:20 And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the
land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>12:21 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>12:22 Son of man, what is that proverb that ye have in the land of
Israel, saying, The days are prolonged, and every vision faileth?</p>
<p>12:23 Tell them therefore, Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will make this
proverb to cease, and they shall no more use it as a proverb in Israel;
but say unto them, The days are at hand, and the effect of every
vision.</p>
<p>12:24 For there shall be no more any vain vision nor flattering
divination within the house of Israel.</p>
<p>12:25 For I am the LORD: I will speak, and the word that I shall
speak shall come to pass; it shall be no more prolonged: for in your
days, O rebellious house, will I say the word, and will perform it,
saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>12:26 Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p>12:27 Son of man, behold, they of the house of Israel say, The vision
that he seeth is for many days to come, and he prophesieth of the times
that are far off.</p>
<p>12:28 Therefore say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; There shall
none of my words be prolonged any more, but the word which I have spoken
shall be done, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
