约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 15章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of Zin
southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.</p>
<p>15:2 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea, from
the bay that looketh southward:</p>
<p>15:3 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and passed
along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto Kadeshbarnea, and
passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and fetched a compass to
Karkaa:</p>
<p>15:4 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the river
of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the sea: this shall
be your south coast.</p>
<p>15:5 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the
sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:</p>
<p>15:6 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the
north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of Bohan the
son of Reuben:</p>
<p>15:7 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the going up to
Adummim, which is on the south side of the river: and the border passed
toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the goings out thereof were at
Enrogel:</p>
<p>15:8 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto
the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the border
went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of
Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants
northward:</p>
<p>15:9 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities of mount
Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim:</p>
<p>15:10 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on
the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and passed on to
Timnah:</p>
<p>15:11 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount Baalah, and
went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the border were at the
sea.</p>
<p>15:12 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round about
according to their families.</p>
<p>15:13 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to Joshua,
even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city is Hebron.</p>
<p>15:14 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.</p>
<p>15:15 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name
of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.</p>
<p>15:16 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.</p>
<p>15:17 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</p>
<p>15:18 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him
to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and Caleb
said unto her, What wouldest thou?</p>
<p>15:19 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper
springs, and the nether springs.</p>
<p>15:20 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
according to their families.</p>
<p>15:21 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and
Jagur,</p>
<p>15:22 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,</p>

their villages:</p>
<p>15:47 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and
her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea, and the border
thereof:</p>
<p>15:48 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,</p>
<p>15:49 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,</p>
<p>15:50 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,</p>
<p>15:51 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
