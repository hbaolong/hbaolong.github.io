以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 10章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>10:1 Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the
head of the cherubims there appeared over them as it were a sapphire
stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</p>
<p>10:2 And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in
between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill thine hand with
coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the
city. And he went in in my sight.</p>
<p>10:3 Now the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the
man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</p>
<p>10:4 Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood
over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the
cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD’s glory.</p>
<p>10:5 And the sound of the cherubims’ wings was heard even to the
outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaketh.</p>
<p>10:6 And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed
with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the
cherubims; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</p>
<p>10:7 And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the
cherubims unto the fire that was between the cherubims, and took
thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen:
who took it, and went out.</p>
<p>10:8 And there appeared in the cherubims the form of a man’s hand
under their wings.</p>
<p>10:9 And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubims, one
wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the
appearance of the wheels was as the colour of a beryl stone.</p>
<p>10:10 And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if
a wheel had been in the midst of a wheel.</p>
<p>10:11 When they went, they went upon their four sides; they turned
not as they went, but to the place whither the head looked they followed
it; they turned not as they went.</p>
<p>10:12 And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and
their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the
wheels that they four had.</p>
<p>10:13 As for the wheels, it was cried unto them in my hearing, O
wheel.</p>
<p>10:14 And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a
cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the
face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</p>
<p>10:15 And the cherubims were lifted up. This is the living creature
that I saw by the river of Chebar.</p>
<p>10:16 And when the cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when
the cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same
wheels also turned not from beside them.</p>
<p>10:17 When they stood, these stood; and when they were lifted up,
these lifted up themselves also: for the spirit of the living creature
was in them.</p>
<p>10:18 Then the glory of the LORD departed from off the threshold of
the house, and stood over the cherubims.</p>
<p>10:19 And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and mounted up from
the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also were beside
them, and every one stood at the door of the east gate of the LORD’s
house; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</p>
<p>10:20 This is the living creature that I saw under the God of Israel
by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were the cherubims.</p>
<p>10:21 Every one had four faces apiece, and every one four wings; and
the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.</p>
<p>10:22 And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw
by the river of Chebar, their appearances and themselves: they went
every one straight forward.</p>
