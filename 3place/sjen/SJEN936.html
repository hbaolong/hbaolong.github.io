耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 2章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</p>
<p>2:2 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD;
I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals,
when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not
sown.</p>
<p>2:3 Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them,
saith the LORD.</p>
<p>2:4 Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the
families of the house of Israel:</p>
<p>2:5 Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me,
that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are
become vain?</p>
<p>2:6 Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of
the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of
deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of
death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man
dwelt?</p>
<p>2:7 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit
thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my
land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</p>
<p>2:8 The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the
law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the
prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not
profit.</p>
<p>2:9 Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with
your children’s children will I plead.</p>
<p>2:10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto
Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</p>
<p>2:11 Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my
people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit.</p>
<p>2:12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be
ye very desolate, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>2:13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me
the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
cisterns, that can hold no water.</p>
<p>2:14 Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he
spoiled?</p>
<p>2:15 The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his
land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</p>
<p>2:16 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of
thy head.</p>
<p>2:17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?</p>
<p>2:18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the
waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink
the waters of the river?</p>
<p>2:19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings
shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and
bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is
not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</p>
<p>2:20 For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and
thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under
every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.</p>
<p>2:21 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how
then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto
me?</p>
<p>2:22 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap,
yet thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>2:23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after
Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a
swift dromedary traversing her ways;</p>
<p>2:24 A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at
her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek
her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</p>
<p>2:25 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:
but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and
after them will I go.</p>
<p>2:26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of
Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and
their prophets,</p>
<p>2:27 Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast
brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their
face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save
us.</p>
<p>2:28 But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise,
if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the
number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</p>
<p>2:29 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed
against me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>2:30 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no
correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a
destroying lion.</p>
<p>2:31 O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a
wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We
are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</p>
<p>2:32 Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my
people have forgotten me days without number.</p>
<p>2:33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also
taught the wicked ones thy ways.</p>
<p>2:34 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</p>
<p>2:35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall
turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I
have not sinned.</p>
<p>2:36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also
shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</p>
<p>2:37 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine
head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not
prosper in them.</p>
