利未记(Leviticus) – 第 6章 ( 本篇共有 27章 )</h4>
<p>6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>6:2 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie
unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in
fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his
neighbour;</p>
<p>6:3 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and
sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning
therein:</p>
<p>6:4 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he
shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he
hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the
lost thing which he found,</p>
<p>6:5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto,
and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass
offering.</p>
<p>6:6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass
offering, unto the priest:</p>
<p>6:7 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD:
and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that he hath done in
trespassing therein.</p>
<p>6:8 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>6:9 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt
offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the
altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be
burning in it.</p>
<p>6:10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the
fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall
put them beside the altar.</p>
<p>6:11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.</p>
<p>6:12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not
be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay
the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat
of the peace offerings.</p>
<p>6:13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go
out.</p>
<p>6:14 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.</p>
<p>6:15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which is upon
the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour,
even the memorial of it, unto the LORD.</p>
<p>6:16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of
the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.</p>
<p>6:17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them for
their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most holy, as is the
sin offering, and as the trespass offering.</p>
<p>6:18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings
of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be
holy.</p>
<p>6:19 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>6:20 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall
offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an
ephah of fine flour for a meat offering perpetual, half of it in the
morning, and half thereof at night.</p>
<p>6:21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering shalt thou
offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</p>
<p>6:22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be wholly
burnt.</p>
<p>6:23 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it
shall not be eaten.</p>
<p>6:24 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>6:25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of the
sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the
sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is most holy.</p>
<p>6:26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
congregation.</p>
<p>6:27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when
there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt
wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.</p>
<p>6:28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken: and
if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in
water.</p>
<p>6:29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
holy.</p>
<p>6:30 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into
the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the holy
place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.</p>
