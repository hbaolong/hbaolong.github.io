约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 9章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>9:1 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side
Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the
great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the
Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard
thereof;</p>
<p>9:2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and
with Israel, with one accord.</p>
<p>9:3 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
unto Jericho and to Ai,</p>
<p>9:4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old,
and rent, and bound up;</p>
<p>9:5 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon
them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.</p>
<p>9:6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now
therefore make ye a league with us.</p>
<p>9:7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?</p>
<p>9:8 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua said
unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?</p>
<p>9:9 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are
come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame
of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</p>
<p>9:10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were
beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which
was at Ashtaroth.</p>
<p>9:11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to
meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make
ye a league with us.</p>
<p>9:12 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and
it is mouldy:</p>
<p>9:13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become
old by reason of the very long journey.</p>
<p>9:14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the
mouth of the LORD.</p>
<p>9:15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to
let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.</p>
<p>9:16 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made
a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and
that they dwelt among them.</p>
<p>9:17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities
on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and
Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.</p>
<p>9:18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel. And
all the congregation murmured against the princes.</p>
<p>9:19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we may not
touch them.</p>
<p>9:20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath
be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.</p>
<p>9:21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the
princes had promised them.</p>
<p>9:22 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye
dwell among us?</p>
<p>9:23 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for
the house of my God.</p>
<p>9:24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant Moses
to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land
from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of
you, and have done this thing.</p>
<p>9:25 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
right unto thee to do unto us, do.</p>
<p>9:26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
the children of Israel, that they slew them not.</p>
<p>9:27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto
this day, in the place which he should choose.</p>
