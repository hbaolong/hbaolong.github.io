– 历代记下(2 31:1 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were
present went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in pieces,
and cut down the groves, and threw down the high places and the altars
out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they
had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the children of Israel
returned, every man to his possession, into their own cities.</h4>
<p>31:2 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
Levites after their courses, every man according to his service, the
priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to
minister, and to give thanks, and to praise in the gates of the tents of
the LORD.</p>
<p>31:3 He appointed also the king’s portion of his substance for the
burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings,
and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for
the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p>31:4 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give
the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be
encouraged in the law of the LORD.</p>
<p>31:5 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and oil, and
honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things
brought they in abundantly.</p>
<p>31:6 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen and sheep,
and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated unto the LORD their
God, and laid them by heaps.</p>
<p>31:7 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.</p>
<p>31:8 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.</p>
<p>31:9 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
concerning the heaps.</p>
<p>31:10 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the
house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and have left plenty: for
the LORD hath blessed his people; and that which is left is this great
store.</p>
<p>31:11 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of the
LORD; and they prepared them,</p>
<p>31:12 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler, and Shimei
his brother was the next.</p>
<p>31:13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were
overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the
commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of
God.</p>
<p>31:14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the
oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.</p>
<p>31:15 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah,
Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests, in their set
office, to give to their brethren by courses, as well to the great as to
the small:</p>
<p>31:16 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and
upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of the LORD,
his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their
courses;</p>
<p>31:17 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their
charges by their courses;</p>
<p>31:18 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives, and
their sons, and their daughters, through all the congregation: for in
their set office they sanctified themselves in holiness:</p>
<p>31:19 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the fields
of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city, the men that were
expressed by name, to give portions to all the males among the priests,
and to all that were reckoned by genealogies among the Levites.</p>
<p>31:20 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.</p>
<p>31:21 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God, he did it
with all his heart, and prospered.</p>
