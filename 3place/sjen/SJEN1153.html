第 7章 ( 本篇共有 16章 )</h4>
<p>7:1 Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the
scribes, which came from Jerusalem.</p>
<p>7:2 And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled,
that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault.</p>
<p>7:3 For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands
oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.</p>
<p>7:4 And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat
not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold,
as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables.</p>
<p>7:5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy
disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with
unwashen hands?</p>
<p>7:6 He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of
you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their
lips, but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p>7:7 Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.</p>
<p>7:8 For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of
men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye
do.</p>
<p>7:9 And he said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of
God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</p>
<p>7:10 For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso
curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</p>
<p>7:11 But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother, It is
Corban, that is to say, a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited
by me; he shall be free.</p>
<p>7:12 And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his
mother;</p>
<p>7:13 Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition,
which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</p>
<p>7:14 And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto
them, Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</p>
<p>7:15 There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can
defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that
defile the man.</p>
<p>7:16 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>7:17 And when he was entered into the house from the people, his
disciples asked him concerning the parable.</p>
<p>7:18 And he saith unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do
ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the
man, it cannot defile him;</p>
<p>7:19 Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and
goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</p>
<p>7:20 And he said, That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the
man.</p>
<p>7:21 For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts,
adulteries, fornications, murders,</p>
<p>7:22 Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an
evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness:</p>
<p>7:23 All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</p>
<p>7:24 And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of Tyre and
Sidon, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he
could not be hid.</p>
<p>7:25 For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit,
heard of him, and came and fell at his feet:</p>
<p>7:26 The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she
besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.</p>
<p>7:27 But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled: for
it is not meet to take the children’s bread, and to cast it unto the
dogs.</p>
<p>7:28 And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs
under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.</p>
<p>7:29 And he said unto her, For this saying go thy way; the devil is
gone out of thy daughter.</p>
<p>7:30 And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone
out, and her daughter laid upon the bed.</p>
<p>7:31 And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came
unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of
Decapolis.</p>
<p>7:32 And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment
in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.</p>
<p>7:33 And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers
into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue;</p>
<p>7:34 And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him,
Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</p>
<p>7:35 And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his
tongue was loosed, and he spake plain.</p>
<p>7:36 And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more
he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it;</p>
<p>7:37 And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all
things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</p>
