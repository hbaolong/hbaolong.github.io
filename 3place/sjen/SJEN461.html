– 撒母耳记下(2 5:1 Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto
Hebron, and spake, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.</h4>
<p>5:2 Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, thou wast he that
leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD said to thee, Thou
shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over
Israel.</p>
<p>5:3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king
David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they
anointed David king over Israel.</p>
<p>5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned
forty years.</p>
<p>5:5 In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months: and
in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and
Judah.</p>
<p>5:6 And the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites,
the inhabitants of the land: which spake unto David, saying, Except thou
take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither:
thinking, David cannot come in hither.</p>
<p>5:7 Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the
city of David.</p>
<p>5:8 And David said on that day, Whosoever getteth up to the gutter,
and smiteth the Jebusites, and the lame and the blind, that are hated of
David’s soul, he shall be chief and captain. Wherefore they said, The
blind and the lame shall not come into the house.</p>
<p>5:9 So David dwelt in the fort, and called it the city of David. And
David built round about from Millo and inward.</p>
<p>5:10 And David went on, and grew great, and the LORD God of hosts was
with him.</p>
<p>5:11 And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar
trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.</p>
<p>5:12 And David perceived that the LORD had established him king over
Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel’s
sake.</p>
<p>5:13 And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem,
after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters
born to David.</p>
<p>5:14 And these be the names of those that were born unto him in
Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,</p>
<p>5:15 Ibhar also, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</p>
<p>5:16 And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphalet.</p>
<p>5:17 But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king
over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David; and David heard
of it, and went down to the hold.</p>
<p>5:18 The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of
Rephaim.</p>
<p>5:19 And David enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up to the
Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the LORD said
unto David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into
thine hand.</p>
<p>5:20 And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there, and
said, The LORD hath broken forth upon mine enemies before me, as the
breach of waters. Therefore he called the name of that place
Baalperazim.</p>
<p>5:21 And there they left their images, and David and his men burned
them.</p>
<p>5:22 And the Philistines came up yet again, and spread themselves in
the valley of Rephaim.</p>
<p>5:23 And when David enquired of the LORD, he said, Thou shalt not go
up; but fetch a compass behind them, and come upon them over against the
mulberry trees.</p>
<p>5:24 And let it be, when thou hearest the sound of a going in the
tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt bestir thyself: for
then shall the LORD go out before thee, to smite the host of the
Philistines.</p>
<p>5:25 And David did so, as the LORD had commanded him; and smote the
Philistines from Geba until thou come to Gazer.</p>
