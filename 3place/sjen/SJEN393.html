约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 17章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>17:1 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the
father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead
and Bashan.</p>
<p>17:2 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh by
their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of
Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem,
and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these
were the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their
families.</p>
<p>17:3 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of
Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these are
the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and
Tirzah.</p>
<p>17:4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua
the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The LORD commanded Moses
to give us an inheritance among our brethren. Therefore according to the
commandment of the LORD he gave them an inheritance among the brethren
of their father.</p>
<p>17:5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;</p>
<p>17:6 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his
sons: and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.</p>
<p>17:7 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto
the inhabitants of Entappuah.</p>
<p>17:8 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border
of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;</p>
<p>17:9 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh: the
coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of the river, and the
outgoings of it were at the sea:</p>
<p>17:10 Southward it was Ephraim’s, and northward it was Manasseh’s,
and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north,
and in Issachar on the east.</p>
<p>17:11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her
towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants
of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns,
even three countries.</p>
<p>17:12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the
inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that
land.</p>
<p>17:13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not utterly
drive them out.</p>
<p>17:14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a
great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me hitherto?</p>
<p>17:15 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get
thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in the land
of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for
thee.</p>
<p>17:16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us:
and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have
chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean and her towns, and they
who are of the valley of Jezreel.</p>
<p>17:17 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great power: thou
shalt not have one lot only:</p>
<p>17:18 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou
shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for thou
shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron chariots, and
though they be strong.</p>
