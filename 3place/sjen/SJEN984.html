耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 50章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>50:1 The word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the
land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.</p>
<p>50:2 Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a
standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is
confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her
images are broken in pieces.</p>
<p>50:3 For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which
shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall
remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.</p>
<p>50:4 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of
Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and
weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.</p>
<p>50:5 They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,
saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual
covenant that shall not be forgotten.</p>
<p>50:6 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them
to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have
gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</p>
<p>50:7 All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries
said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the
habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.</p>
<p>50:8 Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land
of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.</p>
<p>50:9 For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an
assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set
themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their
arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in
vain.</p>
<p>50:10 And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be
satisfied, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>50:11 Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of
mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and
bellow as bulls;</p>
<p>50:12 Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall
be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness,
a dry land, and a desert.</p>
<p>50:13 Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but
it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be
astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.</p>
<p>50:14 Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye
that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned
against the LORD.</p>
<p>50:15 Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her
foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the
vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do
unto her.</p>
<p>50:16 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the
sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they
shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his
own land.</p>
<p>50:17 Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away:
first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.</p>
<p>50:18 Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel;
Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have
punished the king of Assyria.</p>
<p>50:19 And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall
feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount
Ephraim and Gilead.</p>
<p>50:20 In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity
of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of
Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I
reserve.</p>
<p>50:21 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and
against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them,
saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.</p>
<p>50:22 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.</p>
<p>50:23 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken!
how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!</p>
<p>50:24 I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O
Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught,
because thou hast striven against the LORD.</p>
<p>50:25 The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the
weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of
hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.</p>
<p>50:26 Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses:
cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be
left.</p>
<p>50:27 Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe
unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.</p>
<p>50:28 The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of
Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the
vengeance of his temple.</p>
<p>50:29 Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the
bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense
her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto
her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of
Israel.</p>
<p>50:30 Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her
men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>50:31 Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord
GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.</p>
<p>50:32 And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise
him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all
round about him.</p>
<p>50:33 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the
children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them
captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.</p>
<p>50:34 Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he
shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land,
and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>
<p>50:35 A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the
inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.</p>
<p>50:36 A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon
her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.</p>
<p>50:37 A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon
all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall
become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be
robbed.</p>
<p>50:38 A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for
it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.</p>
<p>50:39 Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of
the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it
shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from
generation to generation.</p>
<p>50:40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities
thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any
son of man dwell therein.</p>
<p>50:41 Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation,
and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.</p>
<p>50:42 They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will
not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride
upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against
thee, O daughter of Babylon.</p>
<p>50:43 The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his
hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in
travail.</p>
<p>50:44 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly
run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her?
for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that
shepherd that will stand before me?</p>
<p>50:45 Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the
land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them
out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.</p>
<p>50:46 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and
the cry is heard among the nations.</p>
