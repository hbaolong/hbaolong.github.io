第 5章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
saying,</p>
<p>5:2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
willingly offered themselves.</p>
<p>5:3 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p>5:4 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of
the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the
clouds also dropped water.</p>
<p>5:5 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from
before the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p>5:6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the
highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.</p>
<p>5:7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.</p>
<p>5:8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?</p>
<p>5:9 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered
themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.</p>
<p>5:10 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and
walk by the way.</p>
<p>5:11 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places
of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the
LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages in
Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.</p>
<p>5:12 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak,
and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</p>
<p>5:13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</p>
<p>5:14 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors, and
out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.</p>
<p>5:15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions
of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</p>
<p>5:16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of
the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of
heart.</p>
<p>5:17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.</p>
<p>5:18 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
unto the death in the high places of the field.</p>
<p>5:19 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.</p>
<p>5:20 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
against Sisera.</p>
<p>5:21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.</p>
<p>5:22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
the pransings of their mighty ones.</p>
<p>5:23 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly
the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD,
to the help of the LORD against the mighty.</p>
<p>5:24 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,
blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</p>
<p>5:25 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter
in a lordly dish.</p>
<p>5:26 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
workmen’s hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off
his head, when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.</p>
<p>5:27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</p>
<p>5:28 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the wheels
of his chariots?</p>
<p>5:29 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to
herself,</p>
<p>5:30 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every man
a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a prey of divers
colours of needlework, of divers colours of needlework on both sides,
meet for the necks of them that take the spoil?</p>
<p>5:31 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that love
him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And the land had
rest forty years.</p>
