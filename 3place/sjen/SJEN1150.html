第 4章 ( 本篇共有 16章 )</h4>
<p>4:1 And he began again to teach by the sea side: and there was
gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship, and
sat in the sea; and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.</p>
<p>4:2 And he taught them many things by parables, and said unto them in
his doctrine,</p>
<p>4:3 Hearken; Behold, there went out a sower to sow:</p>
<p>4:4 And it came to pass, as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and
the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.</p>
<p>4:5 And some fell on stony ground, where it had not much earth; and
immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of earth:</p>
<p>4:6 But when the sun was up, it was scorched; and because it had no
root, it withered away.</p>
<p>4:7 And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked
it, and it yielded no fruit.</p>
<p>4:8 And other fell on good ground, and did yield fruit that sprang up
and increased; and brought forth, some thirty, and some sixty, and some
an hundred.</p>
<p>4:9 And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him
hear.</p>
<p>4:10 And when he was alone, they that were about him with the twelve
asked of him the parable.</p>
<p>4:11 And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery
of the kingdom of God: but unto them that are without, all these things
are done in parables:</p>
<p>4:12 That seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may
hear, and not understand; lest at any time they should be converted, and
their sins should be forgiven them.</p>
<p>4:13 And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? and how then
will ye know all parables?</p>
<p>4:14 The sower soweth the word.</p>
<p>4:15 And these are they by the way side, where the word is sown; but
when they have heard, Satan cometh immediately, and taketh away the word
that was sown in their hearts.</p>
<p>4:16 And these are they likewise which are sown on stony ground; who,
when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with gladness;</p>
<p>4:17 And have no root in themselves, and so endure but for a time:
afterward, when affliction or persecution ariseth for the word’s sake,
immediately they are offended.</p>
<p>4:18 And these are they which are sown among thorns; such as hear the
word,</p>
<p>4:19 And the cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,
and the lusts of other things entering in, choke the word, and it
becometh unfruitful.</p>
<p>4:20 And these are they which are sown on good ground; such as hear
the word, and receive it, and bring forth fruit, some thirtyfold, some
sixty, and some an hundred.</p>
<p>4:21 And he said unto them, Is a candle brought to be put under a
bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?</p>
<p>4:22 For there is nothing hid, which shall not be manifested; neither
was any thing kept secret, but that it should come abroad.</p>
<p>4:23 If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</p>
<p>4:24 And he said unto them, Take heed what ye hear: with what measure
ye mete, it shall be measured to you: and unto you that hear shall more
be given.</p>
<p>4:25 For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not,
from him shall be taken even that which he hath.</p>
<p>4:26 And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast
seed into the ground;</p>
<p>4:27 And should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should
spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</p>
<p>4:28 For the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself; first the blade,
then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.</p>
<p>4:29 But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he putteth in
the sickle, because the harvest is come.</p>
<p>4:30 And he said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? or
with what comparison shall we compare it?</p>
<p>4:31 It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in
the earth, is less than all the seeds that be in the earth:</p>
<p>4:32 But when it is sown, it groweth up, and becometh greater than
all herbs, and shooteth out great branches; so that the fowls of the air
may lodge under the shadow of it.</p>
<p>4:33 And with many such parables spake he the word unto them, as they
were able to hear it.</p>
<p>4:34 But without a parable spake he not unto them: and when they were
alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.</p>
<p>4:35 And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them,
Let us pass over unto the other side.</p>
<p>4:36 And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as
he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.</p>
<p>4:37 And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into
the ship, so that it was now full.</p>
<p>4:38 And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow:
and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we
perish?</p>
<p>4:39 And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea,
Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</p>
<p>4:40 And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how is it that ye
have no faith?</p>
<p>4:41 And they feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What
manner of man is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?</p>
