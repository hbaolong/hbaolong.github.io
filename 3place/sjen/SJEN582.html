– 历代记下(2 26:1 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was
sixteen years old, and made him king in the room of his father
Amaziah.</h4>
<p>26:2 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
slept with his fathers.</p>
<p>26:3 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was
Jecoliah of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>26:4 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
according to all that his father Amaziah did.</p>
<p>26:5 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had
understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought the LORD,
God made him to prosper.</p>
<p>26:6 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and brake
down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the wall of Ashdod,
and built cities about Ashdod, and among the Philistines.</p>
<p>26:7 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.</p>
<p>26:8 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened himself
exceedingly.</p>
<p>26:9 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified
them.</p>
<p>26:10 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the plains:
husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains, and in Carmel: for
he loved husbandry.</p>
<p>26:11 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
war by bands, according to the number of their account by the hand of
Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the hand of Hananiah, one
of the king’s captains.</p>
<p>26:12 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
of valour were two thousand and six hundred.</p>
<p>26:13 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to
help the king against the enemy.</p>
<p>26:14 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings to cast
stones.</p>
<p>26:15 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to
be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and great stones
withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he was marvellously helped,
till he was strong.</p>
<p>26:16 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into
the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the altar of incense.</p>
<p>26:17 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:</p>
<p>26:18 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the LORD, but
to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are consecrated to burn incense:
go out of the sanctuary; for thou hast trespassed; neither shall it be
for thine honour from the LORD God.</p>
<p>26:19 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy even rose
up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the LORD, from
beside the incense altar.</p>
<p>26:20 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him
out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go out, because the LORD
had smitten him.</p>
<p>26:21 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the
house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the king’s house, judging
the people of the land.</p>
<p>26:22 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.</p>
<p>26:23 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the kings; for they
said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead.</p>
