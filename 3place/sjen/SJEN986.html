耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 52章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>52:1 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p>
<p>52:2 And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD,
according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</p>
<p>52:3 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah
rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p>
<p>52:4 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth
month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of
Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched
against it, and built forts against it round about.</p>
<p>52:5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
Zedekiah.</p>
<p>52:6 And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the
famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people
of the land.</p>
<p>52:7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and
went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the
two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by
the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</p>
<p>52:8 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and
overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was
scattered from him.</p>
<p>52:9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of
Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon
him.</p>
<p>52:10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his
eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</p>
<p>52:11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon
bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison
till the day of his death.</p>
<p>52:12 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which
was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came
Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, which served the king of Babylon,
into Jerusalem,</p>
<p>52:13 And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all
the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, burned he
with fire:</p>
<p>52:14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain
of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</p>
<p>52:15 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive
certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that
remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of
Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</p>
<p>52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the
poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</p>
<p>52:17 Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the
Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</p>
<p>52:18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
ministered, took they away.</p>
<p>52:19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the
caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which
was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, took the
captain of the guard away.</p>
<p>52:20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were
under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD:
the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</p>
<p>52:21 And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was
eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the
thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</p>
<p>52:22 And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one
chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the
chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the
pomegranates were like unto these.</p>
<p>52:23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all
the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred round about.</p>
<p>52:24 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and
Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</p>
<p>52:25 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of
the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person,
which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who
mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the
land, that were found in the midst of the city.</p>
<p>52:26 So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought
them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</p>
<p>52:27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in
Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of
his own land.</p>
<p>52:28 This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in
the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</p>
<p>52:29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away
captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</p>
<p>52:30 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan
the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred
forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six
hundred.</p>
<p>52:31 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five
and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the
first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah,
and brought him forth out of prison,</p>
<p>52:32 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne
of the kings that were with him in Babylon,</p>
<p>52:33 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat
bread before him all the days of his life.</p>
<p>52:34 And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the
king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the
days of his life.</p>
