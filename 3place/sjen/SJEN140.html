第 18章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>18:1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to
Corinth;</p>
<p>18:2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately
come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had
commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.</p>
<p>18:3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and
wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</p>
<p>18:4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded
the Jews and the Greeks.</p>
<p>18:5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was
pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was
Christ.</p>
<p>18:6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his
raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am
clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</p>
<p>18:7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man’s house,
named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the
synagogue.</p>
<p>18:8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the
Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed,
and were baptized.</p>
<p>18:9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not
afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace:</p>
<p>18:10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee:
for I have much people in this city.</p>
<p>18:11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word
of God among them.</p>
<p>18:12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made
insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the
judgment seat,</p>
<p>18:13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God contrary to
the law.</p>
<p>18:14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto
the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews,
reason would that I should bear with you:</p>
<p>18:15 But if it be a question of words and names, and of your law,
look ye to it; for I will be no judge of such matters.</p>
<p>18:16 And he drave them from the judgment seat.</p>
<p>18:17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the
synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for
none of those things.</p>
<p>18:18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then
took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with
him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had
a vow.</p>
<p>18:19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself
entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</p>
<p>18:20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he
consented not;</p>
<p>18:21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this
feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return again unto you, if God
will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</p>
<p>18:22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted
the church, he went down to Antioch.</p>
<p>18:23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went
over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all
the disciples.</p>
<p>18:24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an
eloquent man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</p>
<p>18:25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being
fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the
Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</p>
<p>18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila
and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him
the way of God more perfectly.</p>
<p>18:27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren
wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come,
helped them much which had believed through grace:</p>
<p>18:28 For he mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing
by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</p>
