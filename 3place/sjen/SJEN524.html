– 列王记下(2 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and
he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.</h4>
<p>22:2 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the
right hand or to the left.</p>
<p>22:3 And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that
the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the
scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,</p>
<p>22:4 Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver
which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the
door have gathered of the people:</p>
<p>22:5 And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work,
that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it
to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair
the breaches of the house,</p>
<p>22:6 Unto carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and
hewn stone to repair the house.</p>
<p>22:7 Howbeit there was no reckoning made with them of the money that
was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</p>
<p>22:8 And Hilkiah the high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have
found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the
book to Shaphan, and he read it.</p>
<p>22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king
word again, and said, Thy servants have gathered the money that was
found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do
the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>22:10 And Shaphan the scribe shewed the king, saying, Hilkiah the
priest hath delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
king.</p>
<p>22:11 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
book of the law, that he rent his clothes.</p>
<p>22:12 And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son
of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and
Asahiah a servant of the king’s, saying,</p>
<p>22:13 Go ye, enquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for
all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is
the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers
have not hearkened unto the words of this book, to do according unto all
that which is written concerning us.</p>
<p>22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and
Asahiah, went unto Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of
Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.</p>
<p>22:15 And she said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
the man that sent you to me,</p>
<p>22:16 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place,
and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which
the king of Judah hath read:</p>
<p>22:17 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of
their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and
shall not be quenched.</p>
<p>22:18 But to the king of Judah which sent you to enquire of the LORD,
thus shall ye say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, As touching
the words which thou hast heard;</p>
<p>22:19 Because thine heart was tender, and thou hast humbled thyself
before the LORD, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, and
against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation
and a curse, and hast rent thy clothes, and wept before me; I also have
heard thee, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>22:20 Behold therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou
shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace; and thine eyes shall not see
all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the
king word again.</p>
