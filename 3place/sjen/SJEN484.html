列王记上(1 4:1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.</h4>
<p>4:2 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadok
the priest,</p>
<p>4:3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes; Jehoshaphat the
son of Ahilud, the recorder.</p>
<p>4:4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok and
Abiathar were the priests:</p>
<p>4:5 And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud
the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king’s friend:</p>
<p>4:6 And Ahishar was over the household: and Adoniram the son of Abda
was over the tribute.</p>
<p>4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which provided
victuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a year
made provision.</p>
<p>4:8 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim:</p>
<p>4:9 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, and
Elonbethhanan:</p>
<p>4:10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh, and all
the land of Hepher:</p>
<p>4:11 The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor; which had Taphath
the daughter of Solomon to wife:</p>
<p>4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,
and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean
to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:</p>
<p>4:13 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of
Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the
region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities with walls
and brasen bars:</p>
<p>4:14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:</p>
<p>4:15 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter of
Solomon to wife:</p>
<p>4:16 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and in Aloth:</p>
<p>4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar:</p>
<p>4:18 Shimei the son of Elah, in Benjamin:</p>
<p>4:19 Geber the son of Uri was in the country of Gilead, in the
country of Sihon king of the Amorites, and of Og king of Bashan; and he
was the only officer which was in the land.</p>
<p>4:20 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in
multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.</p>
<p>4:21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the
land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they brought
presents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.</p>
<p>4:22 And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine
flour, and threescore measures of meal,</p>
<p>4:23 Ten fat oxen, and twenty oxen out of the pastures, and an
hundred sheep, beside harts, and roebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted
fowl.</p>
<p>4:24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,
from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:
and he had peace on all sides round about him.</p>
<p>4:25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine and
under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of
Solomon.</p>
<p>4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his
chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen.</p>
<p>4:27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for
all that came unto king Solomon’s table, every man in his month: they
lacked nothing.</p>
<p>4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought
they unto the place where the officers were, every man according to his
charge.</p>
<p>4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
and largeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.</p>
<p>4:30 And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children of
the east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.</p>
<p>4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, and
Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was in
all nations round about.</p>
<p>4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a
thousand and five.</p>
<p>4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon
even unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also of
beasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.</p>
<p>4:34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from
all kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.</p>
