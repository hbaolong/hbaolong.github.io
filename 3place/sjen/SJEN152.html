第 1章 ( 本篇共有 16章 )</h4>
<p>1:1 Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle,
separated unto the gospel of God,</p>
<p>1:2 (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy
scriptures,)</p>
<p>1:3 Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the
seed of David according to the flesh;</p>
<p>1:4 And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the
spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</p>
<p>1:5 By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to
the faith among all nations, for his name:</p>
<p>1:6 Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p>1:7 To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints:
Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus
Christ.</p>
<p>1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your
faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</p>
<p>1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel
of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my
prayers;</p>
<p>1:10 Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a
prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</p>
<p>1:11 For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual
gift, to the end ye may be established;</p>
<p>1:12 That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual
faith both of you and me.</p>
<p>1:13 Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I
purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have
some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</p>
<p>1:14 I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to
the wise, and to the unwise.</p>
<p>1:15 So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you
that are at Rome also.</p>
<p>1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the
power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew
first, and also to the Greek.</p>
<p>1:17 For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to
faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</p>
<p>1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all
ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in
unrighteousness;</p>
<p>1:19 Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for
God hath shewed it unto them.</p>
<p>1:20 For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world
are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</p>
<p>1:21 Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God,
neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their
foolish heart was darkened.</p>
<p>1:22 Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</p>
<p>1:23 And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image
made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and
creeping things.</p>
<p>1:24 Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts
of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between
themselves:</p>
<p>1:25 Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and
served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.
Amen.</p>
<p>1:26 For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even
their women did change the natural use into that which is against
nature:</p>
<p>1:27 And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which
is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error
which was meet.</p>
<p>1:28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,
God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not
convenient;</p>
<p>1:29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness,
covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit,
malignity; whisperers,</p>
<p>1:30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters,
inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</p>
<p>1:31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural
affection, implacable, unmerciful:</p>
<p>1:32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such
things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in
them that do them.</p>
