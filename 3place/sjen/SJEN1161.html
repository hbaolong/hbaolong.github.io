第 15章 ( 本篇共有 16章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a
consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and
bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</p>
<p>15:2 And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he
answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>15:3 And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he
answered nothing.</p>
<p>15:4 And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?
behold how many things they witness against thee.</p>
<p>15:5 But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</p>
<p>15:6 Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever
they desired.</p>
<p>15:7 And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that
had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the
insurrection.</p>
<p>15:8 And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he
had ever done unto them.</p>
<p>15:9 But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto
you the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>15:10 For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for
envy.</p>
<p>15:11 But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather
release Barabbas unto them.</p>
<p>15:12 And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then
that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</p>
<p>15:13 And they cried out again, Crucify him.</p>
<p>15:14 Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And
they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</p>
<p>15:15 And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas
unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be
crucified.</p>
<p>15:16 And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium;
and they call together the whole band.</p>
<p>15:17 And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of
thorns, and put it about his head,</p>
<p>15:18 And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</p>
<p>15:19 And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon
him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</p>
<p>15:20 And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from
him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</p>
<p>15:21 And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out
of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his
cross.</p>
<p>15:22 And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being
interpreted, The place of a skull.</p>
<p>15:23 And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he
received it not.</p>
<p>15:24 And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments,
casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</p>
<p>15:25 And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</p>
<p>15:26 And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE
KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>15:27 And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right
hand, and the other on his left.</p>
<p>15:28 And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was
numbered with the transgressors.</p>
<p>15:29 And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and
saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three
days,</p>
<p>15:30 Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</p>
<p>15:31 Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves
with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</p>
<p>15:32 Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that
we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled
him.</p>
<p>15:33 And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the
whole land until the ninth hour.</p>
<p>15:34 And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,
Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?</p>
<p>15:35 And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said,
Behold, he calleth Elias.</p>
<p>15:36 And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on
a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether
Elias will come to take him down.</p>
<p>15:37 And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</p>
<p>15:38 And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to
the bottom.</p>
<p>15:39 And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that
he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the
Son of God.</p>
<p>15:40 There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary
Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and
Salome;</p>
<p>15:41 (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered
unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>15:42 And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation,
that is, the day before the sabbath,</p>
<p>15:43 Joseph of Arimathaea, an honourable counsellor, which also
waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and
craved the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>15:44 And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto
him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</p>
<p>15:45 And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to
Joseph.</p>
<p>15:46 And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in
the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and
rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</p>
<p>15:47 And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he
was laid.</p>
