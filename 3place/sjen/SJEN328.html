– 第 22章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the
plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.</p>
<p>22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the
Amorites.</p>
<p>22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:
and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</p>
<p>22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company
lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of
the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that
time.</p>
<p>22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people,
to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:
behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against
me:</p>
<p>22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they
are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite
them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom
thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.</p>
<p>22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and
spake unto him the words of Balak.</p>
<p>22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab
abode with Balaam.</p>
<p>22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with
thee?</p>
<p>22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,</p>
<p>22:11 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the
face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able
to overcome them, and drive them out.</p>
<p>22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.</p>
<p>22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to
go with you.</p>
<p>22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</p>
<p>22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
than they.</p>
<p>22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto
me:</p>
<p>22:17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me
this people.</p>
<p>22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go
beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</p>
<p>22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that
I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</p>
<p>22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which
I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</p>
<p>22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
went with the princes of Moab.</p>
<p>22:22 And God’s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was
riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</p>
<p>22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,
and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the
way.</p>
<p>22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</p>
<p>22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
unto the wall, and crushed Balaam’s foot against the wall: and he smote
her again.</p>
<p>22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the
left.</p>
<p>22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under
Balaam: and Balaam’s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a
staff.</p>
<p>22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these
three times?</p>
<p>22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</p>
<p>22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont
to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</p>
<p>22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he
bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</p>
<p>22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand
thee, because thy way is perverse before me:</p>
<p>22:33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and
saved her alive.</p>
<p>22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for
I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if
it displease thee, I will get me back again.</p>
<p>22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men:
but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak.
So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p>
<p>22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in
the utmost coast.</p>
<p>22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to
promote thee to honour?</p>
<p>22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now
any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my
mouth, that shall I speak.</p>
<p>22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto
Kirjathhuzoth.</p>
<p>22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
the princes that were with him.</p>
<p>22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see
the utmost part of the people.</p>
