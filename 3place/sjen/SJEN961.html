耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 27章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>27:1 In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah
king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the LORD, saying,</p>
<p>27:2 Thus saith the LORD to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put
them upon thy neck,</p>
<p>27:3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and
to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king
of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto
Zedekiah king of Judah;</p>
<p>27:4 And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the LORD
of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;</p>
<p>27:5 I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the
ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it
unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</p>
<p>27:6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the
field have I given him also to serve him.</p>
<p>27:7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son,
until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great
kings shall serve themselves of him.</p>
<p>27:8 And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which
will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that
will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that
nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the
famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his
hand.</p>
<p>27:9 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners,
nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers,
which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of
Babylon:</p>
<p>27:10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your
land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</p>
<p>27:11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the
king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their
own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</p>
<p>27:12 I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these
words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon,
and serve him and his people, and live.</p>
<p>27:13 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the
famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the
nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</p>
<p>27:14 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak
unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they
prophesy a lie unto you.</p>
<p>27:15 For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a
lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish,
ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</p>
<p>27:16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying,
Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that
prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD’s house shall
now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto
you.</p>
<p>27:17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live:
wherefore should this city be laid waste?</p>
<p>27:18 But if they be prophets, and if the word of the LORD be with
them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the
vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the
king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</p>
<p>27:19 For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and
concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue
of the vessels that remain in this city,</p>
<p>27:20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried
away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem
to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</p>
<p>27:21 Yea, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel,
concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the
house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;</p>
<p>27:22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until
the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up,
and restore them to this place.</p>
