以赛亚书(Isaiah) – 第 65章 ( 本篇共有 66章 )</h4>
<p>65:1 I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them
that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that was
not called by my name.</p>
<p>65:2 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people,
which walketh in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;</p>
<p>65:3 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face; that
sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars of brick;</p>
<p>65:4 Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments, which
eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their
vessels;</p>
<p>65:5 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am
holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burneth all
the day.</p>
<p>65:6 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but
will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</p>
<p>65:7 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains, and
blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure their former work
into their bosom.</p>
<p>65:8 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for
my servants’ sakes, that I may not destroy them all.</p>
<p>65:9 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an
inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it, and my
servants shall dwell there.</p>
<p>65:10 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a
place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought
me.</p>
<p>65:11 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that furnish the
drink offering unto that number.</p>
<p>65:12 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow
down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not answer; when I
spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before mine eyes, and did choose
that wherein I delighted not.</p>
<p>65:13 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall
eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye
shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be
ashamed:</p>
<p>65:14 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall
cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of spirit.</p>
<p>65:15 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for
the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another name:</p>
<p>65:16 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself
in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall swear by
the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because
they are hid from mine eyes.</p>
<p>65:17 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p>
<p>65:18 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create:
for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</p>
<p>65:19 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of
crying.</p>
<p>65:20 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old man
that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an hundred years
old; but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed.</p>
<p>65:21 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</p>
<p>65:22 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days of my
people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</p>
<p>65:23 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble; for
they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their offspring with
them.</p>
<p>65:24 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p>
<p>65:25 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent’s meat. They
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the LORD.</p>
