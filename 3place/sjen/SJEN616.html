以斯帖记(Esther) – 第 1章 ( 本篇共有 10章 )</h4>
<p>1:1 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus
which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred and seven
and twenty provinces:)</p>
<p>1:2 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of
his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</p>
<p>1:3 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and
princes of the provinces, being before him:</p>
<p>1:4 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour
of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and fourscore
days.</p>
<p>1:5 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto all
the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and
small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace;</p>
<p>1:6 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords
of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the beds
were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white,
and black, marble.</p>
<p>1:7 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels being
diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the
state of the king.</p>
<p>1:8 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel: for
so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they
should do according to every man’s pleasure.</p>
<p>1:9 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</p>
<p>1:10 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha,
Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence
of Ahasuerus the king,</p>
<p>1:11 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal,
to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look
on.</p>
<p>1:12 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment
by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and his anger
burned in him.</p>
<p>1:13 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</p>
<p>1:14 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish,
Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media,
which saw the king’s face, and which sat the first in the kingdom;)</p>
<p>1:15 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law, because
she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the
chamberlains?</p>
<p>1:16 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the
queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes,
and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king
Ahasuerus.</p>
<p>1:17 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women, so
that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when it shall be
reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in
before him, but she came not.</p>
<p>1:18 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day unto
all the king’s princes, which have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus
shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</p>
<p>1:19 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes,
that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus;
and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than
she.</p>
<p>1:20 And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be
published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives
shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</p>
<p>1:21 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king
did according to the word of Memucan:</p>
<p>1:22 For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every
province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after
their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and
that it should be published according to the language of every
people.</p>
