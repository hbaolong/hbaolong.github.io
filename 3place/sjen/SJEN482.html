– 列王记上(1 2:1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and
he charged Solomon his son, saying,</h4>
<p>2:2 I go the way of all the earth: be thou strong therefore, and shew
thyself a man;</p>
<p>2:3 And keep the charge of the LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to
keep his statutes, and his commandments, and his judgments, and his
testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that thou mayest
prosper in all that thou doest, and whithersoever thou turnest
thyself:</p>
<p>2:4 That the LORD may continue his word which he spake concerning me,
saying, If thy children take heed to their way, to walk before me in
truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail
thee (said he) a man on the throne of Israel.</p>
<p>2:5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to
me, and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto
Abner the son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew,
and shed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon his
girdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on his
feet.</p>
<p>2:6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head
go down to the grave in peace.</p>
<p>2:7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and
let them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to me when
I fled because of Absalom thy brother.</p>
<p>2:8 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, a
Benjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the day
when I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and I
sware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death with the
sword.</p>
<p>2:9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man,
and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bring
thou down to the grave with blood.</p>
<p>2:10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of
David.</p>
<p>2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:
seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he
in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>2:12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and his
kingdom was established greatly.</p>
<p>2:13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of
Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said,
Peaceably.</p>
<p>2:14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she
said, Say on.</p>
<p>2:15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that
all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the
kingdom is turned about, and is become my brother’s: for it was his from
the LORD.</p>
<p>2:16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she said
unto him, Say on.</p>
<p>2:17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for he
will not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to
wife.</p>
<p>2:18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the
king.</p>
<p>2:19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him
for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself unto
her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for the
king’s mother; and she sat on his right hand.</p>
<p>2:20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,
say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for I
will not say thee nay.</p>
<p>2:21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah
thy brother to wife.</p>
<p>2:22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost
thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdom
also; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar the
priest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.</p>
<p>2:23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me,
and more also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own
life.</p>
<p>2:24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me,
and set me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me an
house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</p>
<p>2:25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of
Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.</p>
<p>2:26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to
Anathoth, unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I
will not at this time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of
the LORD God before David my father, and because thou hast been
afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.</p>
<p>2:27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;
that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerning the
house of Eli in Shiloh.</p>
<p>2:28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,
though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of
the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</p>
<p>2:29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto the
tabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon
sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</p>
<p>2:30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said unto
him, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will die
here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,
and thus he answered me.</p>
<p>2:31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall upon
him, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood, which
Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.</p>
<p>2:32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fell
upon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with the
sword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son of
Ner, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, captain
of the host of Judah.</p>
<p>2:33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, and
upon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed,
and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for ever
from the LORD.</p>
<p>2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and
slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</p>
<p>2:35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over
the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of
Abiathar.</p>
<p>2:36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him,
Build thee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth
thence any whither.</p>
<p>2:37 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest
over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt
surely die: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</p>
<p>2:38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord
the king hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in
Jerusalem many days.</p>
<p>2:39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the
servants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And
they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.</p>
<p>2:40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to
Achish to seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants
from Gath.</p>
<p>2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to
Gath, and was come again.</p>
<p>2:42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did
I not make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,
Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad any
whither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The word
that I have heard is good.</p>
<p>2:43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and the
commandment that I have charged thee with?</p>
<p>2:44 The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the
wickedness which thine heart is privy to, that thou didst to David my
father: therefore the LORD shall return thy wickedness upon thine own
head;</p>
<p>2:45 And king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall
be established before the LORD for ever.</p>
<p>2:46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which went
out, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was established in
the hand of Solomon.</p>
