以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 36章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>36:1 Also, thou son of man, prophesy unto the mountains of Israel,
and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the LORD:</p>
<p>36:2 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the enemy hath said against
you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession:</p>
<p>36:3 Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because
they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up on every side, that ye
might be a possession unto the residue of the heathen, and ye are taken
up in the lips of talkers, and are an infamy of the people:</p>
<p>36:4 Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord
GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the
rivers, and to the valleys, to the desolate wastes, and to the cities
that are forsaken, which became a prey and derision to the residue of
the heathen that are round about;</p>
<p>36:5 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Surely in the fire of my
jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the heathen, and against
all Idumea, which have appointed my land into their possession with the
joy of all their heart, with despiteful minds, to cast it out for a
prey.</p>
<p>36:6 Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say unto
the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus
saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury,
because ye have borne the shame of the heathen:</p>
<p>36:7 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I have lifted up mine hand,
Surely the heathen that are about you, they shall bear their shame.</p>
<p>36:8 But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your
branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel; for they are at
hand to come.</p>
<p>36:9 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye
shall be tilled and sown:</p>
<p>36:10 And I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even
all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the wastes shall be
builded:</p>
<p>36:11 And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall
increase and bring fruit: and I will settle you after your old estates,
and will do better unto you than at your beginnings: and ye shall know
that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>36:12 Yea, I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel;
and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and
thou shalt no more henceforth bereave them of men.</p>
<p>36:13 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because they say unto you, Thou land
devourest up men, and hast bereaved thy nations;</p>
<p>36:14 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy
nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>36:15 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the people any
more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall any more, saith the
Lord GOD.</p>
<p>36:16 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>36:17 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land,
they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their way was
before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.</p>
<p>36:18 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they
had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted
it:</p>
<p>36:19 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed
through the countries: according to their way and according to their
doings I judged them.</p>
<p>36:20 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went, they
profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of
the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.</p>
<p>36:21 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel
had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.</p>
<p>36:22 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord
GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for mine holy
name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the heathen, whither ye
went.</p>
<p>36:23 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the
heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen
shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD, when I shall be
sanctified in you before their eyes.</p>
<p>36:24 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.</p>
<p>36:25 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse
you.</p>
<p>36:26 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and
I will give you an heart of flesh.</p>
<p>36:27 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.</p>
<p>36:28 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and
ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p>
<p>36:29 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you.</p>
<p>36:30 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the
heathen.</p>
<p>36:31 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that
were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own sight for your
iniquities and for your abominations.</p>
<p>36:32 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of
Israel.</p>
<p>36:33 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in the
cities, and the wastes shall be builded.</p>
<p>36:34 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
in the sight of all that passed by.</p>
<p>36:35 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are
become fenced, and are inhabited.</p>
<p>36:36 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that
I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was desolate: I
the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.</p>
<p>36:37 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men
like a flock.</p>
<p>36:38 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men: and they
shall know that I am the LORD.</p>
