– 历代记上(1 17:1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that
David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but
the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under curtains.</h4>
<p>17:2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart; for
God is with thee.</p>
<p>17:3 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to
Nathan, saying,</p>
<p>17:4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt
not build me an house to dwell in:</p>
<p>17:5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up
Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from one
tabernacle to another.</p>
<p>17:6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any
of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why
have ye not built me an house of cedars?</p>
<p>17:7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even from
following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people
Israel:</p>
<p>17:8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a
name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
<p>17:9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant
them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more;
neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the
beginning,</p>
<p>17:10 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people
Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell
thee that the LORD will build thee an house.</p>
<p>17:11 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after
thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p>17:12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
ever.</p>
<p>17:13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before
thee:</p>
<p>17:14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever:
and his throne shall be established for evermore.</p>
<p>17:15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p>17:16 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me
hitherto?</p>
<p>17:17 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
hast also spoken of thy servant’s house for a great while to come, and
hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O LORD
God.</p>
<p>17:18 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy
servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</p>
<p>17:19 O LORD, for thy servant’s sake, and according to thine own
heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all these
great things.</p>
<p>17:20 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God
beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</p>
<p>17:21 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel,
whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a name of
greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy
people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</p>
<p>17:22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for
ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.</p>
<p>17:23 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever,
and do as thou hast said.</p>
<p>17:24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a God to
Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be established before
thee.</p>
<p>17:25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to pray
before thee.</p>
<p>17:26 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
unto thy servant:</p>
<p>17:27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy
servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O LORD,
and it shall be blessed for ever.</p>
