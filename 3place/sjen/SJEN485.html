– 列王记上(1 5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon;
for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his
father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David.</h4>
<p>5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,</p>
<p>5:3 Thou knowest how that David my father could not build an house
unto the name of the LORD his God for the wars which were about him on
every side, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</p>
<p>5:4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so that
there is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.</p>
<p>5:5 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the
LORD my God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son,
whom I will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house
unto my name.</p>
<p>5:6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out of
Lebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto thee will
I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shalt appoint:
for thou knowest that there is not among us any that can skill to hew
timber like unto the Sidonians.</p>
<p>5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that
he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, which hath
given unto David a wise son over this great people.</p>
<p>5:8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things
which thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerning
timber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.</p>
<p>5:9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and
I will convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shalt
appoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt
receive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my
household.</p>
<p>5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all
his desire.</p>
<p>5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for
food to his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave
Solomon to Hiram year by year.</p>
<p>5:12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there
was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league
together.</p>
<p>5:13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levy
was thirty thousand men.</p>
<p>5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: a
month they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram was
over the levy.</p>
<p>5:15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,
and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains;</p>
<p>5:16 Beside the chief of Solomon’s officers which were over the work,
three thousand and three hundred, which ruled over the people that
wrought in the work.</p>
<p>5:17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costly
stones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.</p>
<p>5:18 And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders did hew them, and
the stonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the
house.</p>
