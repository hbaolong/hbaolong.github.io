第 7章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>7:1 After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk
in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>
<p>7:2 Now the Jews’ feast of tabernacles was at hand.</p>
<p>7:3 His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into
Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.</p>
<p>7:4 For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he
himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew
thyself to the world.</p>
<p>7:5 For neither did his brethren believe in him.</p>
<p>7:6 Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time
is alway ready.</p>
<p>7:7 The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of
it, that the works thereof are evil.</p>
<p>7:8 Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my
time is not yet full come.</p>
<p>7:9 When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in
Galilee.</p>
<p>7:10 But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto
the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.</p>
<p>7:11 Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is
he?</p>
<p>7:12 And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him:
for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the
people.</p>
<p>7:13 Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.</p>
<p>7:14 Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple,
and taught.</p>
<p>7:15 And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned?</p>
<p>7:16 Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his
that sent me.</p>
<p>7:17 If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.</p>
<p>7:18 He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
unrighteousness is in him.</p>
<p>7:19 Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the
law? Why go ye about to kill me?</p>
<p>7:20 The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about
to kill thee?</p>
<p>7:21 Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye
all marvel.</p>
<p>7:22 Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is
of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a
man.</p>
<p>7:23 If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law
of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a
man every whit whole on the sabbath day?</p>
<p>7:24 Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous
judgment.</p>
<p>7:25 Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they
seek to kill?</p>
<p>7:26 But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do
the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?</p>
<p>7:27 Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh,
no man knoweth whence he is.</p>
<p>7:28 Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both
know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he
that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</p>
<p>7:29 But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.</p>
<p>7:30 Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him,
because his hour was not yet come.</p>
<p>7:31 And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath
done?</p>
<p>7:32 The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to
take him.</p>
<p>7:33 Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and
then I go unto him that sent me.</p>
<p>7:34 Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither
ye cannot come.</p>
<p>7:35 Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we
shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles,
and teach the Gentiles?</p>
<p>7:36 What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me,
and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</p>
<p>7:37 In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and
cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</p>
<p>7:38 He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his
belly shall flow rivers of living water.</p>
<p>7:39 (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him
should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus
was not yet glorified.)</p>
<p>7:40 Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said,
Of a truth this is the Prophet.</p>
<p>7:41 Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ
come out of Galilee?</p>
<p>7:42 Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of
David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?</p>
<p>7:43 So there was a division among the people because of him.</p>
<p>7:44 And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on
him.</p>
<p>7:45 Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and
they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?</p>
<p>7:46 The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.</p>
<p>7:47 Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?</p>
<p>7:48 Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?</p>
<p>7:49 But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.</p>
<p>7:50 Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night,
being one of them,)</p>
<p>7:51 Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he
doeth?</p>
<p>7:52 They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee?
Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.</p>
<p>7:53 And every man went unto his own house.</p>
