约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 10章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>10:1 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had heard
how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to
Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the
inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among
them;</p>
<p>10:2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as
one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the
men thereof were mighty.</p>
<p>10:3 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of
Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish,
and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</p>
<p>10:4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it
hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</p>
<p>10:5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,
the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king
of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their
hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</p>
<p>10:6 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and
save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in
the mountains are gathered together against us.</p>
<p>10:7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</p>
<p>10:8 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand
before thee.</p>
<p>10:9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from
Gilgal all night.</p>
<p>10:10 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with
a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up
to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</p>
<p>10:11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great stones
from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they were more which
died with hailstones than they whom the children of Israel slew with the
sword.</p>
<p>10:12 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in
the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon,
in the valley of Ajalon.</p>
<p>10:13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the
book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and
hasted not to go down about a whole day.</p>
<p>10:14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought for
Israel.</p>
<p>10:15 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.</p>
<p>10:16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
Makkedah.</p>
<p>10:17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in
a cave at Makkedah.</p>
<p>10:18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
and set men by it for to keep them:</p>
<p>10:19 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the
LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.</p>
<p>10:20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had
made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were
consumed, that the rest which remained of them entered into fenced
cities.</p>
<p>10:21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of
Israel.</p>
<p>10:22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
those five kings unto me out of the cave.</p>
<p>10:23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of
Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</p>
<p>10:24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the
captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet
upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet
upon the necks of them.</p>
<p>10:25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong
and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all your enemies
against whom ye fight.</p>
<p>10:26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them
on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the
evening.</p>
<p>10:27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast
them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in
the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.</p>
<p>10:28 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge
of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all
the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king
of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
<p>10:29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto
Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</p>
<p>10:30 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the
hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the
souls that were therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king
thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.</p>
<p>10:31 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
<p>10:32 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which
took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
all the souls that were therein, according to all that he had done to
Libnah.</p>
<p>10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</p>
<p>10:34 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</p>
<p>10:35 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the
sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly destroyed that
day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</p>
<p>10:36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
Hebron; and they fought against it:</p>
<p>10:37 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that
were therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done
to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that were
therein.</p>
<p>10:38 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
fought against it:</p>
<p>10:39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly
destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left none remaining: as he
had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he
had done also to Libnah, and to her king.</p>
<p>10:40 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south,
and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none
remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the LORD God of
Israel commanded.</p>
<p>10:41 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and all
the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</p>
<p>10:42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,
because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.</p>
<p>10:43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
Gilgal.</p>
