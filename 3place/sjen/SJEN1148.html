第 2章 ( 本篇共有 16章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 And again he entered into Capernaum after some days; and it was
noised that he was in the house.</p>
<p>2:2 And straightway many were gathered together, insomuch that there
was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door: and he
preached the word unto them.</p>
<p>2:3 And they come unto him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was
borne of four.</p>
<p>2:4 And when they could not come nigh unto him for the press, they
uncovered the roof where he was: and when they had broken it up, they
let down the bed wherein the sick of the palsy lay.</p>
<p>2:5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the sick of the palsy,
Son, thy sins be forgiven thee.</p>
<p>2:6 But there were certain of the scribes sitting there, and
reasoning in their hearts,</p>
<p>2:7 Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies? who can forgive sins
but God only?</p>
<p>2:8 And immediately when Jesus perceived in his spirit that they so
reasoned within themselves, he said unto them, Why reason ye these
things in your hearts?</p>
<p>2:9 Whether is it easier to say to the sick of the palsy, Thy sins be
forgiven thee; or to say, Arise, and take up thy bed, and walk?</p>
<p>2:10 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to
forgive sins, (he saith to the sick of the palsy,)</p>
<p>2:11 I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into
thine house.</p>
<p>2:12 And immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before
them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying,
We never saw it on this fashion.</p>
<p>2:13 And he went forth again by the sea side; and all the multitude
resorted unto him, and he taught them.</p>
<p>2:14 And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at
the receipt of custom, and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and
followed him.</p>
<p>2:15 And it came to pass, that, as Jesus sat at meat in his house,
many publicans and sinners sat also together with Jesus and his
disciples: for there were many, and they followed him.</p>
<p>2:16 And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans
and sinners, they said unto his disciples, How is it that he eateth and
drinketh with publicans and sinners?</p>
<p>2:17 When Jesus heard it, he saith unto them, They that are whole
have no need of the physician, but they that are sick: I came not to
call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>
<p>2:18 And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees used to fast: and
they come and say unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the
Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?</p>
<p>2:19 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
fast, while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the
bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</p>
<p>2:20 But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away
from them, and then shall they fast in those days.</p>
<p>2:21 No man also seweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment: else
the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old, and the rent
is made worse.</p>
<p>2:22 And no man putteth new wine into old bottles: else the new wine
doth burst the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles will be
marred: but new wine must be put into new bottles.</p>
<p>2:23 And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the
sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of
corn.</p>
<p>2:24 And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the
sabbath day that which is not lawful?</p>
<p>2:25 And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did, when
he had need, and was an hungred, he, and they that were with him?</p>
<p>2:26 How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the
high priest, and did eat the shewbread, which is not lawful to eat but
for the priests, and gave also to them which were with him?</p>
<p>2:27 And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man
for the sabbath:</p>
<p>2:28 Therefore the Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.</p>
