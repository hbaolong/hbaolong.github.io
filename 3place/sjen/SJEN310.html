– 第 4章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>4:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p>4:2 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi,
after their families, by the house of their fathers,</p>
<p>4:3 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all
that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the
congregation.</p>
<p>4:4 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle
of the congregation, about the most holy things:</p>
<p>4:5 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of
testimony with it:</p>
<p>4:6 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins, and shall
spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves
thereof.</p>
<p>4:7 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and
covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon:</p>
<p>4:8 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the
same with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put in the staves
thereof.</p>
<p>4:9 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of
the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all
the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it:</p>
<p>4:10 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put it upon a bar.</p>
<p>4:11 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and
cover it with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put to the staves
thereof:</p>
<p>4:12 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and
cover them with a covering of badgers’ skins, and shall put them on a
bar:</p>
<p>4:13 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a
purple cloth thereon:</p>
<p>4:14 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the
shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall
spread upon it a covering of badgers’ skins, and put to the staves of
it.</p>
<p>4:15 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set
forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it: but they
shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the
burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>4:16 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily
meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the
tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the
vessels thereof.</p>
<p>4:17 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</p>
<p>4:18 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from
among the Levites:</p>
<p>4:19 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in,
and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden:</p>
<p>4:20 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
covered, lest they die.</p>
<p>4:21 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>4:22 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses
of their fathers, by their families;</p>
<p>4:23 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the
work in the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>4:24 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
serve, and for burdens:</p>
<p>4:25 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the
badgers’ skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation,</p>
<p>4:26 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of
the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round
about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and
all that is made for them: so shall they serve.</p>
<p>4:27 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all
their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their
burdens.</p>
<p>4:28 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in
the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the
hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</p>
<p>4:29 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
families, by the house of their fathers;</p>
<p>4:30 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt
thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the
work of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>4:31 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the
tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets
thereof,</p>
<p>4:32 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and
their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all
their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge
of their burden.</p>
<p>4:33 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation,
under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.</p>
<p>4:34 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of
their fathers,</p>
<p>4:35 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle
of the congregation:</p>
<p>4:36 And those that were numbered of them by their families were two
thousand seven hundred and fifty.</p>
<p>4:37 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to the
commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p>4:38 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout
their families, and by the house of their fathers,</p>
<p>4:39 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle
of the congregation,</p>
<p>4:40 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six
hundred and thirty.</p>
<p>4:41 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to the
commandment of the LORD.</p>
<p>4:42 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers,</p>
<p>4:43 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle
of the congregation,</p>
<p>4:44 Even those that were numbered of them after their families, were
three thousand and two hundred.</p>
<p>4:45 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the LORD
by the hand of Moses.</p>
<p>4:46 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families, and after
the house of their fathers,</p>
<p>4:47 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service
of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation,</p>
<p>4:48 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
five hundred and fourscore.</p>
<p>4:49 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by
the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and according to
his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as the LORD commanded
Moses.</p>
