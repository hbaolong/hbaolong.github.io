– 列王记下(2 8:1 Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had
restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and
sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a
famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years.</h4>
<p>8:2 And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God:
and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the
Philistines seven years.</p>
<p>8:3 And it came to pass at the seven years’ end, that the woman
returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry
unto the king for her house and for her land.</p>
<p>8:4 And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God,
saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath
done.</p>
<p>8:5 And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had
restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had
restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And
Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son,
whom Elisha restored to life.</p>
<p>8:6 And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king
appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers,
and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land,
even until now.</p>
<p>8:7 And Elisha came to Damascus; and Benhadad the king of Syria was
sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither.</p>
<p>8:8 And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and
go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I
recover of this disease?</p>
<p>8:9 So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of
every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood
before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of Syria hath sent me to
thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?</p>
<p>8:10 And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest
certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely
die.</p>
<p>8:11 And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed:
and the man of God wept.</p>
<p>8:12 And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I
know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of Israel: their
strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay
with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women
with child.</p>
<p>8:13 And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should
do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that
thou shalt be king over Syria.</p>
<p>8:14 So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to
him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou
shouldest surely recover.</p>
<p>8:15 And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth,
and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and
Hazael reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>8:16 And in the fifth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel,
Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat
king of Judah began to reign.</p>
<p>8:17 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he
reigned eight years in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>8:18 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the
house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in
the sight of the LORD.</p>
<p>8:19 Yet the LORD would not destroy Judah for David his servant’s
sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his
children.</p>
<p>8:20 In his days Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah, and made
a king over themselves.</p>
<p>8:21 So Joram went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and
he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and
the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents.</p>
<p>8:22 Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day.
Then Libnah revolted at the same time.</p>
<p>8:23 And the rest of the acts of Joram, and all that he did, are they
not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>8:24 And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with his
fathers in the city of David: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his
stead.</p>
<p>8:25 In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Ahab king of Israel did
Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah begin to reign.</p>
<p>8:26 Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and
he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah,
the daughter of Omri king of Israel.</p>
<p>8:27 And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in
the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in
law of the house of Ahab.</p>
<p>8:28 And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael
king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.</p>
<p>8:29 And king Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds
which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael
king of Syria. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to
see Joram the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.</p>
