第 8章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there
was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and
they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and
Samaria, except the apostles.</p>
<p>8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great
lamentation over him.</p>
<p>8:3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every
house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</p>
<p>8:4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where
preaching the word.</p>
<p>8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ
unto them.</p>
<p>8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which
Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</p>
<p>8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many
that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that
were lame, were healed.</p>
<p>8:8 And there was great joy in that city.</p>
<p>8:9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in
the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving
out that himself was some great one:</p>
<p>8:10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest,
saying, This man is the great power of God.</p>
<p>8:11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had
bewitched them with sorceries.</p>
<p>8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning
the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized,
both men and women.</p>
<p>8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he
continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs
which were done.</p>
<p>8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria
had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</p>
<p>8:15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might
receive the Holy Ghost:</p>
<p>8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were
baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</p>
<p>8:17 Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy
Ghost.</p>
<p>8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles’ hands
the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</p>
<p>8:19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands,
he may receive the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because
thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</p>
<p>8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is
not right in the sight of God.</p>
<p>8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if
perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</p>
<p>8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in
the bond of iniquity.</p>
<p>8:24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that
none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</p>
<p>8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the
Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of
the Samaritans.</p>
<p>8:26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and
go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto
Gaza, which is desert.</p>
<p>8:27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch
of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the
charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to
worship,</p>
<p>8:28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the
prophet.</p>
<p>8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
this chariot.</p>
<p>8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</p>
<p>8:31 And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he
desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</p>
<p>8:32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as
a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so
opened he not his mouth:</p>
<p>8:33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall
declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.</p>
<p>8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?</p>
<p>8:35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture,
and preached unto him Jesus.</p>
<p>8:36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:
and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be
baptized?</p>
<p>8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son
of God.</p>
<p>8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down
both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized
him.</p>
<p>8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the
Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on
his way rejoicing.</p>
<p>8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached
in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</p>
