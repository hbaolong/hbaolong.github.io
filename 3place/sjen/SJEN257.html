希伯来书(Hebrews) – 第 9章 ( 本篇共有 13章 )</h4>
<p>9:1 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
service, and a worldly sanctuary.</p>
<p>9:2 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called the
sanctuary.</p>
<p>9:3 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
Holiest of all;</p>
<p>9:4 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid
round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot that had manna, and
Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</p>
<p>9:5 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of
which we cannot now speak particularly.</p>
<p>9:6 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always
into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.</p>
<p>9:7 But into the second went the high priest alone once every year,
not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for the errors of
the people:</p>
<p>9:8 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest of
all was not yet made manifest, while as the first tabernacle was yet
standing:</p>
<p>9:9 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the
service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</p>
<p>9:10 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and
carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</p>
<p>9:11 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come, by
a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to
say, not of this building;</p>
<p>9:12 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood
he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption for us.</p>
<p>9:13 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of the
flesh:</p>
<p>9:14 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal
Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from
dead works to serve the living God?</p>
<p>9:15 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, that
by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions that were
under the first testament, they which are called might receive the
promise of eternal inheritance.</p>
<p>9:16 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
death of the testator.</p>
<p>9:17 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it is
of no strength at all while the testator liveth.</p>
<p>9:18 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
blood.</p>
<p>9:19 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of goats, with
water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book, and
all the people,</p>
<p>9:20 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath
enjoined unto you.</p>
<p>9:21 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all
the vessels of the ministry.</p>
<p>9:22 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
without shedding of blood is no remission.</p>
<p>9:23 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>
<p>9:24 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands,
which are the figures of the true; but into heaven itself, now to appear
in the presence of God for us:</p>
<p>9:25 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;</p>
<p>9:26 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the
world: but now once in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away
sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>
<p>9:27 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the
judgment:</p>
<p>9:28 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto
salvation.</p>
