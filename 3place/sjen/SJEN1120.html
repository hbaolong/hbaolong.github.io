马太福音(Matthew) – 第 2章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
Jerusalem,</p>
<p>2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>
<p>2:3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and
all Jerusalem with him.</p>
<p>2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the
people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</p>
<p>2:5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
written by the prophet,</p>
<p>2:6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among
the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall
rule my people Israel.</p>
<p>2:7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of
them diligently what time the star appeared.</p>
<p>2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently
for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again,
that I may come and worship him also.</p>
<p>2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,
which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood
over where the young child was.</p>
<p>2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
joy.</p>
<p>2:11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child
with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they
had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh.</p>
<p>2:12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</p>
<p>2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young child
and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I bring
thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</p>
<p>2:14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,
and departed into Egypt:</p>
<p>2:15 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of
Egypt have I called my son.</p>
<p>2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was
exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were in
Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and under,
according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wise
men.</p>
<p>2:17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,
saying,</p>
<p>2:18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not be
comforted, because they are not.</p>
<p>2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth
in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</p>
<p>2:20 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go
into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young
child’s life.</p>
<p>2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came
into the land of Israel.</p>
<p>2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room
of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being
warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee:</p>
<p>2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a
Nazarene.</p>
