但以理书(Daniel) – 第 10章 ( 本篇共有 12章 )</h4>
<p>10:1 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true,
but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had
understanding of the vision.</p>
<p>10:2 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</p>
<p>10:3 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my
mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were
fulfilled.</p>
<p>10:4 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was
by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;</p>
<p>10:5 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man
clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</p>
<p>10:6 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance
of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet
like in colour to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the
voice of a multitude.</p>
<p>10:7 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me
saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so that they
fled to hide themselves.</p>
<p>10:8 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there
remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into
corruption, and I retained no strength.</p>
<p>10:9 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice
of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward
the ground.</p>
<p>10:10 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees and
upon the palms of my hands.</p>
<p>10:11 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand upright: for unto
thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood
trembling.</p>
<p>10:12 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten thyself
before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words.</p>
<p>10:13 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help
me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</p>
<p>10:14 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</p>
<p>10:15 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face toward
the ground, and I became dumb.</p>
<p>10:16 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched
my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood
before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I
have retained no strength.</p>
<p>10:17 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord?
for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is
there breath left in me.</p>
<p>10:18 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of
a man, and he strengthened me,</p>
<p>10:19 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee,
be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I was
strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened
me.</p>
<p>10:20 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone
forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.</p>
<p>10:21 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but
Michael your prince.</p>
