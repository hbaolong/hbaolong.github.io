启示录(Revelation) – 第 2章 ( 本篇共有 22章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith
he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the
midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</p>
<p>2:2 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou
canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say
they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</p>
<p>2:3 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name’s sake hast
laboured, and hast not fainted.</p>
<p>2:4 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left
thy first love.</p>
<p>2:5 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and
do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will
remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</p>
<p>2:6 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.</p>
<p>2:7 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life,
which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</p>
<p>2:8 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</p>
<p>2:9 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are
not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</p>
<p>2:10 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye
shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will
give thee a crown of life.</p>
<p>2:11 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</p>
<p>2:12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</p>
<p>2:13 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s
seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith,
even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain
among you, where Satan dwelleth.</p>
<p>2:14 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a
stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed
unto idols, and to commit fornication.</p>
<p>2:15 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.</p>
<p>2:16 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
against them with the sword of my mouth.</p>
<p>2:17 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna,
and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written,
which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</p>
<p>2:18 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things
saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and
his feet are like fine brass;</p>
<p>2:19 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy
patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</p>
<p>2:20 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to
teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things
sacrificed unto idols.</p>
<p>2:21 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
repented not.</p>
<p>2:22 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their
deeds.</p>
<p>2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will
give unto every one of you according to your works.</p>
<p>2:24 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as
they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</p>
<p>2:25 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</p>
<p>2:26 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to
him will I give power over the nations:</p>
<p>2:27 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my
Father.</p>
<p>2:28 And I will give him the morning star.</p>
<p>2:29 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the
churches.</p>
