耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 49章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>49:1 Concerning the Ammonites, thus saith the LORD; Hath Israel no
sons? hath he no heir? why then doth their king inherit Gad, and his
people dwell in his cities?</p>
<p>49:2 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will
cause an alarm of war to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites; and it
shall be a desolate heap, and her daughters shall be burned with fire:
then shall Israel be heir unto them that were his heirs, saith the
LORD.</p>
<p>49:3 Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, ye daughters of Rabbah,
gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for
their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes
together.</p>
<p>49:4 Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys, thy flowing valley, O
backsliding daughter? that trusted in her treasures, saying, Who shall
come unto me?</p>
<p>49:5 Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of
hosts, from all those that be about thee; and ye shall be driven out
every man right forth; and none shall gather up him that wandereth.</p>
<p>49:6 And afterward I will bring again the captivity of the children
of Ammon, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>49:7 Concerning Edom, thus saith the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more
in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom
vanished?</p>
<p>49:8 Flee ye, turn back, dwell deep, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I
will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I will visit
him.</p>
<p>49:9 If grapegatherers come to thee, would they not leave some
gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, they will destroy till they have
enough.</p>
<p>49:10 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,
and he shall not be able to hide himself: his seed is spoiled, and his
brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</p>
<p>49:11 Leave thy fatherless children, I will preserve them alive; and
let thy widows trust in me.</p>
<p>49:12 For thus saith the LORD; Behold, they whose judgment was not to
drink of the cup have assuredly drunken; and art thou he that shall
altogether go unpunished? thou shalt not go unpunished, but thou shalt
surely drink of it.</p>
<p>49:13 For I have sworn by myself, saith the LORD, that Bozrah shall
become a desolation, a reproach, a waste, and a curse; and all the
cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</p>
<p>49:14 I have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador is sent
unto the heathen, saying, Gather ye together, and come against her, and
rise up to the battle.</p>
<p>49:15 For, lo, I will make thee small among the heathen, and despised
among men.</p>
<p>49:16 Thy terribleness hath deceived thee, and the pride of thine
heart, O thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, that holdest the
height of the hill: though thou shouldest make thy nest as high as the
eagle, I will bring thee down from thence, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>49:17 Also Edom shall be a desolation: every one that goeth by it
shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues thereof.</p>
<p>49:18 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour
cities thereof, saith the LORD, no man shall abide there, neither shall
a son of man dwell in it.</p>
<p>49:19 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of
Jordan against the habitation of the strong: but I will suddenly make
him run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over
her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is
that shepherd that will stand before me?</p>
<p>49:20 Therefore hear the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken
against Edom; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the
inhabitants of Teman: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out:
surely he shall make their habitations desolate with them.</p>
<p>49:21 The earth is moved at the noise of their fall, at the cry the
noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.</p>
<p>49:22 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread his
wings over Bozrah: and at that day shall the heart of the mighty men of
Edom be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.</p>
<p>49:23 Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad: for they
have heard evil tidings: they are fainthearted; there is sorrow on the
sea; it cannot be quiet.</p>
<p>49:24 Damascus is waxed feeble, and turneth herself to flee, and fear
hath seized on her: anguish and sorrows have taken her, as a woman in
travail.</p>
<p>49:25 How is the city of praise not left, the city of my joy!</p>
<p>49:26 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the
men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD of hosts.</p>
<p>49:27 And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall
consume the palaces of Benhadad.</p>
<p>49:28 Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which
Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon shall smite, thus saith the LORD; Arise
ye, go up to Kedar, and spoil the men of the east.</p>
<p>49:29 Their tents and their flocks shall they take away: they shall
take to themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their
camels; and they shall cry unto them, Fear is on every side.</p>
<p>49:30 Flee, get you far off, dwell deep, O ye inhabitants of Hazor,
saith the LORD; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath taken counsel
against you, and hath conceived a purpose against you.</p>
<p>49:31 Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation, that dwelleth
without care, saith the LORD, which have neither gates nor bars, which
dwell alone.</p>
<p>49:32 And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their
cattle a spoil: and I will scatter into all winds them that are in the
utmost corners; and I will bring their calamity from all sides thereof,
saith the LORD.</p>
<p>49:33 And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons, and a desolation for
ever: there shall no man abide there, nor any son of man dwell in
it.</p>
<p>49:34 The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah the prophet against
Elam in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah,
saying,</p>
<p>49:35 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will break the bow of
Elam, the chief of their might.</p>
<p>49:36 And upon Elam will I bring the four winds from the four
quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and
there shall be no nation whither the outcasts of Elam shall not
come.</p>
<p>49:37 For I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies, and
before them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, even
my fierce anger, saith the LORD; and I will send the sword after them,
till I have consumed them:</p>
<p>49:38 And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from thence
the king and the princes, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>49:39 But it shall come to pass in the latter days, that I will bring
again the captivity of Elam, saith the LORD.</p>
