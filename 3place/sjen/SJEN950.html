耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 16章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>16:1 The word of the LORD came also unto me, saying,</p>
<p>16:2 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or
daughters in this place.</p>
<p>16:3 For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the
daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that
bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this
land;</p>
<p>16:4 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented;
neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of
the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and
their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts
of the earth.</p>
<p>16:5 For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning,
neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace
from this people, saith the LORD, even lovingkindness and mercies.</p>
<p>16:6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall
not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves,
nor make themselves bald for them:</p>
<p>16:7 Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to
comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of
consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.</p>
<p>16:8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with
them to eat and to drink.</p>
<p>16:9 For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I
will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days,
the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the
bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</p>
<p>16:10 And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all
these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the LORD
pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or
what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?</p>
<p>16:11 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have
forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have
served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have
not kept my law;</p>
<p>16:12 And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk
every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not
hearken unto me:</p>
<p>16:13 Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye
know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other
gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.</p>
<p>16:14 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall
no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel
out of the land of Egypt;</p>
<p>16:15 But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel
from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven
them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their
fathers.</p>
<p>16:16 Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they
shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall
hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes
of the rocks.</p>
<p>16:17 For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my
face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.</p>
<p>16:18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin
double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine
inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable
things.</p>
<p>16:19 O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day
of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the
earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity,
and things wherein there is no profit.</p>
<p>16:20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?</p>
<p>16:21 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will
cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my
name is The LORD.</p>
