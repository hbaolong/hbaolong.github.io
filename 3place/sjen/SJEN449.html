– 撒母耳记上(1 24:1 And it came to pass, when Saul was returned from
following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David
is in the wilderness of Engedi.</h4>
<p>24:2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and
went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.</p>
<p>24:3 And he came to the sheepcotes by the way, where was a cave; and
Saul went in to cover his feet: and David and his men remained in the
sides of the cave.</p>
<p>24:4 And the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the
LORD said unto thee, Behold, I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand,
that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee. Then David
arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul’s robe privily.</p>
<p>24:5 And it came to pass afterward, that David’s heart smote him,
because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.</p>
<p>24:6 And he said unto his men, The LORD forbid that I should do this
thing unto my master, the LORD’s anointed, to stretch forth mine hand
against him, seeing he is the anointed of the LORD.</p>
<p>24:7 So David stayed his servants with these words, and suffered them
not to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave, and went on
his way.</p>
<p>24:8 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave, and cried
after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him,
David stooped with his face to the earth, and bowed himself.</p>
<p>24:9 And David said to Saul, Wherefore hearest thou men’s words,
saying, Behold, David seeketh thy hurt?</p>
<p>24:10 Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the LORD had
delivered thee to day into mine hand in the cave: and some bade me kill
thee: but mine eye spared thee; and I said, I will not put forth mine
hand against my lord; for he is the LORD’s anointed.</p>
<p>24:11 Moreover, my father, see, yea, see the skirt of thy robe in my
hand: for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe, and killed thee not,
know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in mine
hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou huntest my soul to
take it.</p>
<p>24:12 The LORD judge between me and thee, and the LORD avenge me of
thee: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
<p>24:13 As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceedeth
from the wicked: but mine hand shall not be upon thee.</p>
<p>24:14 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom dost thou
pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.</p>
<p>24:15 The LORD therefore be judge, and judge between me and thee, and
see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of thine hand.</p>
<p>24:16 And it came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking
these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David?
And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>
<p>24:17 And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I: for thou
hast rewarded me good, whereas I have rewarded thee evil.</p>
<p>24:18 And thou hast shewed this day how that thou hast dealt well
with me: forasmuch as when the LORD had delivered me into thine hand,
thou killedst me not.</p>
<p>24:19 For if a man find his enemy, will he let him go well away?
wherefore the LORD reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this
day.</p>
<p>24:20 And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king,
and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thine hand.</p>
<p>24:21 Swear now therefore unto me by the LORD, that thou wilt not cut
off my seed after me, and that thou wilt not destroy my name out of my
father’s house.</p>
<p>24:22 And David sware unto Saul. And Saul went home; but David and
his men gat them up unto the hold.</p>
