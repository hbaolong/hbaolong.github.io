第 12章 ( 本篇共有 16章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man
planted a vineyard, and set an hedge about it, and digged a place for
the winefat, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went
into a far country.</p>
<p>12:2 And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a servant, that he
might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.</p>
<p>12:3 And they caught him, and beat him, and sent him away empty.</p>
<p>12:4 And again he sent unto them another servant; and at him they
cast stones, and wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully
handled.</p>
<p>12:5 And again he sent another; and him they killed, and many others;
beating some, and killing some.</p>
<p>12:6 Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also
last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.</p>
<p>12:7 But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir;
come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be our’s.</p>
<p>12:8 And they took him, and killed him, and cast him out of the
vineyard.</p>
<p>12:9 What shall therefore the lord of the vineyard do? he will come
and destroy the husbandmen, and will give the vineyard unto others.</p>
<p>12:10 And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the
builders rejected is become the head of the corner:</p>
<p>12:11 This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our
eyes?</p>
<p>12:12 And they sought to lay hold on him, but feared the people: for
they knew that he had spoken the parable against them: and they left
him, and went their way.</p>
<p>12:13 And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the
Herodians, to catch him in his words.</p>
<p>12:14 And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know
that thou art true, and carest for no man: for thou regardest not the
person of men, but teachest the way of God in truth: Is it lawful to
give tribute to Caesar, or not?</p>
<p>12:15 Shall we give, or shall we not give? But he, knowing their
hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? bring me a penny, that I may
see it.</p>
<p>12:16 And they brought it. And he saith unto them, Whose is this
image and superscription? And they said unto him, Caesar’s.</p>
<p>12:17 And Jesus answering said unto them, Render to Caesar the things
that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s. And they
marvelled at him.</p>
<p>12:18 Then come unto him the Sadducees, which say there is no
resurrection; and they asked him, saying,</p>
<p>12:19 Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother die, and leave
his wife behind him, and leave no children, that his brother should take
his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</p>
<p>12:20 Now there were seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and
dying left no seed.</p>
<p>12:21 And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed:
and the third likewise.</p>
<p>12:22 And the seven had her, and left no seed: last of all the woman
died also.</p>
<p>12:23 In the resurrection therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife
shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.</p>
<p>12:24 And Jesus answering said unto them, Do ye not therefore err,
because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?</p>
<p>12:25 For when they shall rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor
are given in marriage; but are as the angels which are in heaven.</p>
<p>12:26 And as touching the dead, that they rise: have ye not read in
the book of Moses, how in the bush God spake unto him, saying, I am the
God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?</p>
<p>12:27 He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living: ye
therefore do greatly err.</p>
<p>12:28 And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him,
Which is the first commandment of all?</p>
<p>12:29 And Jesus answered him, The first of all the commandments is,
Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is one Lord:</p>
<p>12:30 And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and
with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength:
this is the first commandment.</p>
<p>12:31 And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy
neighbour as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than
these.</p>
<p>12:32 And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the
truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he:</p>
<p>12:33 And to love him with all the heart, and with all the
understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to
love his neighbour as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings
and sacrifices.</p>
<p>12:34 And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto
him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that
durst ask him any question.</p>
<p>12:35 And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How
say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?</p>
<p>12:36 For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The LORD said to my
Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy
footstool.</p>
<p>12:37 David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then
his son? And the common people heard him gladly.</p>
<p>12:38 And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes,
which love to go in long clothing, and love salutations in the
marketplaces,</p>
<p>12:39 And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms
at feasts:</p>
<p>12:40 Which devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long
prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.</p>
<p>12:41 And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the
people cast money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in
much.</p>
<p>12:42 And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two
mites, which make a farthing.</p>
<p>12:43 And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them,
Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all
they which have cast into the treasury:</p>
<p>12:44 For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her
want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.</p>
