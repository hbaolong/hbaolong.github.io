第 23章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>23:1 And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto
Pilate.</p>
<p>23:2 And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow
perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying
that he himself is Christ a King.</p>
<p>23:3 And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And
he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</p>
<p>23:4 Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find
no fault in this man.</p>
<p>23:5 And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the
people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this
place.</p>
<p>23:6 When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a
Galilaean.</p>
<p>23:7 And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s
jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at
that time.</p>
<p>23:8 And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was
desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things
of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.</p>
<p>23:9 Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him
nothing.</p>
<p>23:10 And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused
him.</p>
<p>23:11 And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked
him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to
Pilate.</p>
<p>23:12 And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together:
for before they were at enmity between themselves.</p>
<p>23:13 And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and
the rulers and the people,</p>
<p>23:14 Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that
perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you,
have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse
him:</p>
<p>23:15 No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing
worthy of death is done unto him.</p>
<p>23:16 I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</p>
<p>23:17 (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the
feast.)</p>
<p>23:18 And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and
release unto us Barabbas:</p>
<p>23:19 (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder,
was cast into prison.)</p>
<p>23:20 Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to
them.</p>
<p>23:21 But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</p>
<p>23:22 And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he
done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise
him, and let him go.</p>
<p>23:23 And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might
be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests
prevailed.</p>
<p>23:24 And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they
required.</p>
<p>23:25 And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was
cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their
will.</p>
<p>23:26 And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a
Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross,
that he might bear it after Jesus.</p>
<p>23:27 And there followed him a great company of people, and of women,
which also bewailed and lamented him.</p>
<p>23:28 But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep
not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</p>
<p>23:29 For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say,
Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps
which never gave suck.</p>
<p>23:30 Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and
to the hills, Cover us.</p>
<p>23:31 For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done
in the dry?</p>
<p>23:32 And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be
put to death.</p>
<p>23:33 And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary,
there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand,
and the other on the left.</p>
<p>23:34 Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what
they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</p>
<p>23:35 And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them
derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be
Christ, the chosen of God.</p>
<p>23:36 And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering
him vinegar,</p>
<p>23:37 And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.</p>
<p>23:38 And a superscription also was written over him in letters of
Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
<p>23:39 And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him,
saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.</p>
<p>23:40 But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear
God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</p>
<p>23:41 And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our
deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</p>
<p>23:42 And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into
thy kingdom.</p>
<p>23:43 And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt
thou be with me in paradise.</p>
<p>23:44 And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over
all the earth until the ninth hour.</p>
<p>23:45 And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent
in the midst.</p>
<p>23:46 And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the
ghost.</p>
<p>23:47 Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God,
saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</p>
<p>23:48 And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding
the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</p>
<p>23:49 And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from
Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</p>
<p>23:50 And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he
was a good man, and a just:</p>
<p>23:51 (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;)
he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for
the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>23:52 This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</p>
<p>23:53 And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a
sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.</p>
<p>23:54 And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</p>
<p>23:55 And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed
after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</p>
<p>23:56 And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and
rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.</p>
