– 历代记上(1 21:1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David
to number Israel.</h4>
<p>21:2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them
to me, that I may know it.</p>
<p>21:3 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so
many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s
servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a
cause of trespass to Israel?</p>
<p>21:4 Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>21:5 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand
men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten
thousand men that drew sword.</p>
<p>21:6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king’s
word was abominable to Joab.</p>
<p>21:7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
Israel.</p>
<p>21:8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy
servant; for I have done very foolishly.</p>
<p>21:9 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p>
<p>21:10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee
three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</p>
<p>21:11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
Choose thee</p>
<p>21:12 Either three years’ famine; or three months to be destroyed
before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee;
or else three days the sword of the LORD, even the pestilence, in the
land, and the angel of the LORD destroying throughout all the coasts of
Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to
him that sent me.</p>
<p>21:13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies: but let
me not fall into the hand of man.</p>
<p>21:14 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
Israel seventy thousand men.</p>
<p>21:15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and
said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And
the angel of the LORD stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the
Jebusite.</p>
<p>21:16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand
stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders of Israel, who
were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</p>
<p>21:17 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but
as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O
LORD my God, be on me, and on my father’s house; but not on thy people,
that they should be plagued.</p>
<p>21:18 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the
threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</p>
<p>21:19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
name of the LORD.</p>
<p>21:20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</p>
<p>21:21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with his face
to the ground.</p>
<p>21:22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the LORD: thou
shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from
the people.</p>
<p>21:23 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the
king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee the oxen also
for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the
wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</p>
<p>21:24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for
the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for the LORD,
nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</p>
<p>21:25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
gold by weight.</p>
<p>21:26 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered burnt
offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD; and he answered
him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</p>
<p>21:27 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again
into the sheath thereof.</p>
<p>21:28 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</p>
<p>21:29 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that season in
the high place at Gibeon.</p>
<p>21:30 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.</p>
<p>21:31 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is
the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</p>
