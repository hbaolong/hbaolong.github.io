耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 36章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>36:1 And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of
Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the LORD,
saying,</p>
<p>36:2 Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that
I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against
all the nations, from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of
Josiah, even unto this day.</p>
<p>36:3 It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I
purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil
way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</p>
<p>36:4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote
from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had
spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.</p>
<p>36:5 And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go
into the house of the LORD:</p>
<p>36:6 Therefore go thou, and read in the roll, which thou hast written
from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the
LORD’s house upon the fasting day: and also thou shalt read them in the
ears of all Judah that come out of their cities.</p>
<p>36:7 It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD,
and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and
the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people.</p>
<p>36:8 And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah
the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in
the LORD’s house.</p>
<p>36:9 And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of
Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast
before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people
that came from the cities of Judah unto Jerusalem.</p>
<p>36:10 Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house
of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe,
in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD’s house,
in the ears of all the people.</p>
<p>36:11 When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had
heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,</p>
<p>36:12 Then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s
chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe,
and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and
Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all
the princes.</p>
<p>36:13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had
heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</p>
<p>36:14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the
son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine
hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and
come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came
unto them.</p>
<p>36:15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears.
So Baruch read it in their ears.</p>
<p>36:16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they
were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely
tell the king of all these words.</p>
<p>36:17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou
write all these words at his mouth?</p>
<p>36:18 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto
me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.</p>
<p>36:19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and
Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.</p>
<p>36:20 And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up
the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words
in the ears of the king.</p>
<p>36:21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out
of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the
king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the
king.</p>
<p>36:22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and
there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.</p>
<p>36:23 And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four
leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was
on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on
the hearth.</p>
<p>36:24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the
king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</p>
<p>36:25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made
intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would
not hear them.</p>
<p>36:26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and
Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take
Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them.</p>
<p>36:27 Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king
had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of
Jeremiah, saying,</p>
<p>36:28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former
words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah
hath burned.</p>
<p>36:29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the
LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein,
saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land,
and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</p>
<p>36:30 Therefore thus saith the LORD of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He
shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall
be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</p>
<p>36:31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their
iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of
Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have
pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</p>
<p>36:32 Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the
scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah
all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in
the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.</p>
