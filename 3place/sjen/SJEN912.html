以赛亚书(Isaiah) – 第 44章 ( 本篇共有 66章 )</h4>
<p>44:1 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
chosen:</p>
<p>44:2 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou,
Jesurun, whom I have chosen.</p>
<p>44:3 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon
the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing
upon thine offspring:</p>
<p>44:4 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the
water courses.</p>
<p>44:5 One shall say, I am the LORD’s; and another shall call himself
by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the
LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.</p>
<p>44:6 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is
no God.</p>
<p>44:7 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that
are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.</p>
<p>44:8 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God
beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.</p>
<p>44:9 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their
delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses;
they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.</p>
<p>44:10 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
profitable for nothing?</p>
<p>44:11 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they
are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet
they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.</p>
<p>44:12 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his
arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water,
and is faint.</p>
<p>44:13 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a
line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass,
and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a
man; that it may remain in the house.</p>
<p>44:14 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he
planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.</p>
<p>44:15 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh
a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down
thereto.</p>
<p>44:16 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he
eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth
himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:</p>
<p>44:17 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image:
he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and
saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.</p>
<p>44:18 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their
eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot
understand.</p>
<p>44:19 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea,
also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh,
and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall
I fall down to the stock of a tree?</p>
<p>44:20 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside,
that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right
hand?</p>
<p>44:21 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I
have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be
forgotten of me.</p>
<p>44:22 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.</p>
<p>44:23 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest,
and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified
himself in Israel.</p>
<p>44:24 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from
the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth
the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;</p>
<p>44:25 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge
foolish;</p>
<p>44:26 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be
inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will
raise up the decayed places thereof:</p>
<p>44:27 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy
rivers:</p>
<p>44:28 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the
temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.</p>
