第 12章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.</p>
<p>12:2 There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was
one of them that sat at the table with him.</p>
<p>12:3 Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and
the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.</p>
<p>12:4 Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son,
which should betray him,</p>
<p>12:5 Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and
given to the poor?</p>
<p>12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was
a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</p>
<p>12:7 Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
hath she kept this.</p>
<p>12:8 For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not
always.</p>
<p>12:9 Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus
also, whom he had raised from the dead.</p>
<p>12:10 But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus
also to death;</p>
<p>12:11 Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and
believed on Jesus.</p>
<p>12:12 On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</p>
<p>12:13 Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and
cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of
the Lord.</p>
<p>12:14 And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is
written,</p>
<p>12:15 Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on
an ass’s colt.</p>
<p>12:16 These things understood not his disciples at the first: but
when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were
written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</p>
<p>12:17 The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.</p>
<p>12:18 For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard
that he had done this miracle.</p>
<p>12:19 The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.</p>
<p>12:20 And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to
worship at the feast:</p>
<p>12:21 The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of
Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</p>
<p>12:22 Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip
tell Jesus.</p>
<p>12:23 And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son
of man should be glorified.</p>
<p>12:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall
into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth
forth much fruit.</p>
<p>12:25 He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his
life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.</p>
<p>12:26 If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there
shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father
honour.</p>
<p>12:27 Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me
from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</p>
<p>12:28 Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven,
saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.</p>
<p>12:29 The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it
thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.</p>
<p>12:30 Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but
for your sakes.</p>
<p>12:31 Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this
world be cast out.</p>
<p>12:32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto
me.</p>
<p>12:33 This he said, signifying what death he should die.</p>
<p>12:34 The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that
Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be
lifted up? who is this Son of man?</p>
<p>12:35 Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with
you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he
that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</p>
<p>12:36 While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the
children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide
himself from them.</p>
<p>12:37 But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they
believed not on him:</p>
<p>12:38 That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which
he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm
of the Lord been revealed?</p>
<p>12:39 Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said
again,</p>
<p>12:40 He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they
should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be
converted, and I should heal them.</p>
<p>12:41 These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of
him.</p>
<p>12:42 Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him;
but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should
be put out of the synagogue:</p>
<p>12:43 For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of
God.</p>
<p>12:44 Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on
me, but on him that sent me.</p>
<p>12:45 And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.</p>
<p>12:46 I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on
me should not abide in darkness.</p>
<p>12:47 And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not:
for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</p>
<p>12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that
judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in
the last day.</p>
<p>12:49 For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me,
he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should
speak.</p>
<p>12:50 And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever
I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.</p>
