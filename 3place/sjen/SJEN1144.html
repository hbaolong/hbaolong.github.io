马太福音(Matthew) – 第 26章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>26:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,
he said unto his disciples,</p>
<p>26:2 Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and
the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</p>
<p>26:3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and
the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was
called Caiaphas,</p>
<p>26:4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill
him.</p>
<p>26:5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar
among the people.</p>
<p>26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
leper,</p>
<p>26:7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very
precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</p>
<p>26:8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To
what purpose is this waste?</p>
<p>26:9 For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to
the poor.</p>
<p>26:10 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the
woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</p>
<p>26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
always.</p>
<p>26:12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did
it for my burial.</p>
<p>26:13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be
preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath
done, be told for a memorial of her.</p>
<p>26:14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the
chief priests,</p>
<p>26:15 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver
him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of
silver.</p>
<p>26:16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</p>
<p>26:17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the
disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we
prepare for thee to eat the passover?</p>
<p>26:18 And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him,
The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy
house with my disciples.</p>
<p>26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they
made ready the passover.</p>
<p>26:20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</p>
<p>26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one
of you shall betray me.</p>
<p>26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them
to say unto him, Lord, is it I?</p>
<p>26:23 And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in
the dish, the same shall betray me.</p>
<p>26:24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that
man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if
he had not been born.</p>
<p>26:25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is
it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.</p>
<p>26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and
brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my
body.</p>
<p>26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,
saying, Drink ye all of it;</p>
<p>26:28 For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for
many for the remission of sins.</p>
<p>26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit
of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s
kingdom.</p>
<p>26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of
Olives.</p>
<p>26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of
me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the
sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</p>
<p>26:32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into
Galilee.</p>
<p>26:33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be
offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</p>
<p>26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,
before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</p>
<p>26:35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I
not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</p>
<p>26:36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and
saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</p>
<p>26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and
began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</p>
<p>26:38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even
unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</p>
<p>26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,
saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</p>
<p>26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and
saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</p>
<p>26:41 Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit
indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</p>
<p>26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my
Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy
will be done.</p>
<p>26:43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were
heavy.</p>
<p>26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third
time, saying the same words.</p>
<p>26:45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on
now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man
is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</p>
<p>26:46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray
me.</p>
<p>26:47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and
with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief
priests and elders of the people.</p>
<p>26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I
shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</p>
<p>26:49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and
kissed him.</p>
<p>26:50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then
came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.</p>
<p>26:51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out
his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s,
and smote off his ear.</p>
<p>26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his
place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</p>
<p>26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall
presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?</p>
<p>26:54 But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it
must be?</p>
<p>26:55 In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out
as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily
with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</p>
<p>26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</p>
<p>26:57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas
the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</p>
<p>26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace,
and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</p>
<p>26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought
false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;</p>
<p>26:60 But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet
found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,</p>
<p>26:61 And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of
God, and to build it in three days.</p>
<p>26:62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou
nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?</p>
<p>26:63 But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said
unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether
thou be the Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p>26:64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto
you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of
power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</p>
<p>26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken
blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have
heard his blasphemy.</p>
<p>26:66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of
death.</p>
<p>26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others
smote him with the palms of their hands,</p>
<p>26:68 Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
thee?</p>
<p>26:69 Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto
him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>
<p>26:70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou
sayest.</p>
<p>26:71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,
and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of
Nazareth.</p>
<p>26:72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</p>
<p>26:73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to
Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth
thee.</p>
<p>26:74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the
man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>
<p>26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,
Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and
wept bitterly.</p>
