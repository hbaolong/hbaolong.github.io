以赛亚书(Isaiah) – 第 66章 ( 本篇共有 66章 )</h4>
<p>66:1 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is
my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the
place of my rest?</p>
<p>66:2 For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things
have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that
is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word.</p>
<p>66:3 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that
sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offereth an
oblation, as if he offered swine’s blood; he that burneth incense, as if
he blessed an idol. Yea, they have chosen their own ways, and their soul
delighteth in their abominations.</p>
<p>66:4 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears
upon them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spake, they
did not hear: but they did evil before mine eyes, and chose that in
which I delighted not.</p>
<p>66:5 Hear the word of the LORD, ye that tremble at his word; Your
brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name’s sake, said, Let
the LORD be glorified: but he shall appear to your joy, and they shall
be ashamed.</p>
<p>66:6 A voice of noise from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice
of the LORD that rendereth recompence to his enemies.</p>
<p>66:7 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,
she was delivered of a man child.</p>
<p>66:8 Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Shall
the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or shall a nation be born
at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her
children.</p>
<p>66:9 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? saith
the LORD: shall I cause to bring forth, and shut the womb? saith thy
God.</p>
<p>66:10 Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that
love her: rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:</p>
<p>66:11 That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her
consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance
of her glory.</p>
<p>66:12 For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her
like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing stream: then
shall ye suck, ye shall be borne upon her sides, and be dandled upon her
knees.</p>
<p>66:13 As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you; and
ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>66:14 And when ye see this, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones
shall flourish like an herb: and the hand of the LORD shall be known
toward his servants, and his indignation toward his enemies.</p>
<p>66:15 For, behold, the LORD will come with fire, and with his
chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke
with flames of fire.</p>
<p>66:16 For by fire and by his sword will the LORD plead with all
flesh: and the slain of the LORD shall be many.</p>
<p>66:17 They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in the
gardens behind one tree in the midst, eating swine’s flesh, and the
abomination, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the
LORD.</p>
<p>66:18 For I know their works and their thoughts: it shall come, that
I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my
glory.</p>
<p>66:19 And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that
escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw
the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have not heard
my fame, neither have seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory
among the Gentiles.</p>
<p>66:20 And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the
LORD out of all nations upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters,
and upon mules, and upon swift beasts, to my holy mountain Jerusalem,
saith the LORD, as the children of Israel bring an offering in a clean
vessel into the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>66:21 And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith
the LORD.</p>
<p>66:22 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,
shall remain before me, saith the LORD, so shall your seed and your name
remain.</p>
<p>66:23 And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another,
and from one sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship before
me, saith the LORD.</p>
<p>66:24 And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the men
that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither
shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all
flesh.</p>
