申命记(Deuteronomy) – 第 2章 ( 本篇共有 34章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the
way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount
Seir many days.</p>
<p>2:2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
<p>2:3 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
northward.</p>
<p>2:4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the
coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and
they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves
therefore:</p>
<p>2:5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no,
not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau
for a possession.</p>
<p>2:6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</p>
<p>2:7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty
years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked
nothing.</p>
<p>2:8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from
Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of
Moab.</p>
<p>2:9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for
a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a
possession.</p>
<p>2:10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,
and tall, as the Anakims;</p>
<p>2:11 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
Moabites call them Emims.</p>
<p>2:12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and
dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession,
which the LORD gave unto them.</p>
<p>2:13 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
went over the brook Zered.</p>
<p>2:14 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we were
come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the
generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the
LORD sware unto them.</p>
<p>2:15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy
them from among the host, until they were consumed.</p>
<p>2:16 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
dead from among the people,</p>
<p>2:17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</p>
<p>2:18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this
day:</p>
<p>2:19 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the
land of the children of Ammon any possession; because I have given it
unto the children of Lot for a possession.</p>
<p>2:20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein
in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</p>
<p>2:21 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD
destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their
stead:</p>
<p>2:22 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he
destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and
dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</p>
<p>2:23 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt
in their stead.)</p>
<p>2:24 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon,
and his land: begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</p>
<p>2:25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear
report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of
thee.</p>
<p>2:26 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p>
<p>2:27 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I
will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</p>
<p>2:28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my
feet;</p>
<p>2:29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the
land which the LORD our God giveth us.</p>
<p>2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the
LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he
might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.</p>
<p>2:31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his
land.</p>
<p>2:32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight
at Jahaz.</p>
<p>2:33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him,
and his sons, and all his people.</p>
<p>2:34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none
to remain:</p>
<p>2:35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil
of the cities which we took.</p>
<p>2:36 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one
city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</p>
<p>2:37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor
unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the
mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</p>
