以赛亚书(Isaiah) – 第 63章 ( 本篇共有 66章 )</h4>
<p>63:1 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the
greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to
save.</p>
<p>63:2 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
him that treadeth in the winefat?</p>
<p>63:3 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there was
none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in
my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will
stain all my raiment.</p>
<p>63:4 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
redeemed is come.</p>
<p>63:5 And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought salvation unto
me; and my fury, it upheld me.</p>
<p>63:6 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the earth.</p>
<p>63:7 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the praises
of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath bestowed on us, and the
great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath bestowed on
them according to his mercies, and according to the multitude of his
lovingkindnesses.</p>
<p>63:8 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not
lie: so he was their Saviour.</p>
<p>63:9 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them; and
he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.</p>
<p>63:10 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was
turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.</p>
<p>63:11 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the
shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy Spirit within
him?</p>
<p>63:12 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm,
dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?</p>
<p>63:13 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,
that they should not stumble?</p>
<p>63:14 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD
caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a
glorious name.</p>
<p>63:15 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength, the
sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they
restrained?</p>
<p>63:16 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of
us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our father, our
redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.</p>
<p>63:17 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and
hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants’ sake, the
tribes of thine inheritance.</p>
<p>63:18 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little
while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</p>
<p>63:19 We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
called by thy name.</p>
