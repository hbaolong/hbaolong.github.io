– 哥林多前书(1 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would
not have you ignorant.</h4>
<p>12:2 Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb
idols, even as ye were led.</p>
<p>12:3 Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the
Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus
is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>12:4 Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</p>
<p>12:5 And there are differences of administrations, but the same
Lord.</p>
<p>12:6 And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God
which worketh all in all.</p>
<p>12:7 But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to
profit withal.</p>
<p>12:8 For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another
the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</p>
<p>12:9 To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of
healing by the same Spirit;</p>
<p>12:10 To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to
another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to
another the interpretation of tongues:</p>
<p>12:11 But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit,
dividing to every man severally as he will.</p>
<p>12:12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the
members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is
Christ.</p>
<p>12:13 For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we
be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made
to drink into one Spirit.</p>
<p>12:14 For the body is not one member, but many.</p>
<p>12:15 If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>
<p>12:16 And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of
the body; is it therefore not of the body?</p>
<p>12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the
whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</p>
<p>12:18 But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body,
as it hath pleased him.</p>
<p>12:19 And if they were all one member, where were the body?</p>
<p>12:20 But now are they many members, yet but one body.</p>
<p>12:21 And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee:
nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</p>
<p>12:22 Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more
feeble, are necessary:</p>
<p>12:23 And those members of the body, which we think to be less
honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely
parts have more abundant comeliness.</p>
<p>12:24 For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the
body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which
lacked:</p>
<p>12:25 That there should be no schism in the body; but that the
members should have the same care one for another.</p>
<p>12:26 And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it;
or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</p>
<p>12:27 Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</p>
<p>12:28 And God hath set some in the church, first apostles,
secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts
of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</p>
<p>12:29 Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all
workers of miracles?</p>
<p>12:30 Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do
all interpret?</p>
<p>12:31 But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a
more excellent way.</p>
