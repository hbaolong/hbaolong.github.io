– 列王记下(2 11:1 And when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her
son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal.</h4>
<p>11:2 But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah,
took Joash the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons
which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the
bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.</p>
<p>11:3 And he was with her hid in the house of the LORD six years. And
Athaliah did reign over the land.</p>
<p>11:4 And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over
hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into
the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath
of them in the house of the LORD, and shewed them the king’s son.</p>
<p>11:5 And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall
do; A third part of you that enter in on the sabbath shall even be
keepers of the watch of the king’s house;</p>
<p>11:6 And a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; and a third part
at the gate behind the guard: so shall ye keep the watch of the house,
that it be not broken down.</p>
<p>11:7 And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they
shall keep the watch of the house of the LORD about the king.</p>
<p>11:8 And ye shall compass the king round about, every man with his
weapons in his hand: and he that cometh within the ranges, let him be
slain: and be ye with the king as he goeth out and as he cometh in.</p>
<p>11:9 And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things
that Jehoiada the priest commanded: and they took every man his men that
were to come in on the sabbath, with them that should go out on the
sabbath, and came to Jehoiada the priest.</p>
<p>11:10 And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king
David’s spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:11 And the guard stood, every man with his weapons in his hand,
round about the king, from the right corner of the temple to the left
corner of the temple, along by the altar and the temple.</p>
<p>11:12 And he brought forth the king’s son, and put the crown upon
him, and gave him the testimony; and they made him king, and anointed
him; and they clapped their hands, and said, God save the king.</p>
<p>11:13 And when Athaliah heard the noise of the guard and of the
people, she came to the people into the temple of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:14 And when she looked, behold, the king stood by a pillar, as the
manner was, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the
people of the land rejoiced, and blew with trumpets: and Athaliah rent
her clothes, and cried, Treason, Treason.</p>
<p>11:15 But Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains of the hundreds,
the officers of the host, and said unto them, Have her forth without the
ranges: and him that followeth her kill with the sword. For the priest
had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:16 And they laid hands on her; and she went by the way by the
which the horses came into the king’s house: and there was she
slain.</p>
<p>11:17 And Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and
the people, that they should be the LORD’s people; between the king also
and the people.</p>
<p>11:18 And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal, and
brake it down; his altars and his images brake they in pieces
thoroughly, and slew Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars. And
the priest appointed officers over the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>11:19 And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the
guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king
from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard
to the king’s house. And he sat on the throne of the kings.</p>
<p>11:20 And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was in
quiet: and they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king’s
house.</p>
<p>11:21 Seven years old was Jehoash when he began to reign.</p>
