– 列王记下(2 9:1 And Elisha the prophet called one of the children of
the prophets, and said unto him, Gird up thy loins, and take this box of
oil in thine hand, and go to Ramothgilead:</h4>
<p>9:2 And when thou comest thither, look out there Jehu the son of
Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from
among his brethren, and carry him to an inner chamber;</p>
<p>9:3 Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus
saith the LORD, I have anointed thee king over Israel. Then open the
door, and flee, and tarry not.</p>
<p>9:4 So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to
Ramothgilead.</p>
<p>9:5 And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting;
and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto
which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.</p>
<p>9:6 And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on
his head, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I have
anointed thee king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</p>
<p>9:7 And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab thy master, that I may
avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the
servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</p>
<p>9:8 For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from
Ahab him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left
in Israel:</p>
<p>9:9 And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the
son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</p>
<p>9:10 And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and
there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</p>
<p>9:11 Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said
unto him, Is all well? wherefore came this mad fellow to thee? And he
said unto them, Ye know the man, and his communication.</p>
<p>9:12 And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and
thus spake he to me, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I have anointed thee
king over Israel.</p>
<p>9:13 Then they hasted, and took every man his garment, and put it
under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu
is king.</p>
<p>9:14 So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired
against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel,
because of Hazael king of Syria.</p>
<p>9:15 But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the
wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king
of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth
nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</p>
<p>9:16 So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay
there. And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</p>
<p>9:17 And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied
the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram
said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it
peace?</p>
<p>9:18 So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus saith
the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace?
turn thee behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came
to them, but he cometh not again.</p>
<p>9:19 Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and
said, Thus saith the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What hast
thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me.</p>
<p>9:20 And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and
cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of
Nimshi; for he driveth furiously.</p>
<p>9:21 And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And
Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his
chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of
Naboth the Jezreelite.</p>
<p>9:22 And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it
peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the whoredoms of
thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</p>
<p>9:23 And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There
is treachery, O Ahaziah.</p>
<p>9:24 And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram
between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down
in his chariot.</p>
<p>9:25 Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in
the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how
that, when I and thou rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid
this burden upon him;</p>
<p>9:26 Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood
of his sons, saith the LORD; and I will requite thee in this plat, saith
the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground,
according to the word of the LORD.</p>
<p>9:27 But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way
of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him
also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by
Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</p>
<p>9:28 And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and
buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.</p>
<p>9:29 And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah
to reign over Judah.</p>
<p>9:30 And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she
painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</p>
<p>9:31 And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace,
who slew his master?</p>
<p>9:32 And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my
side? who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</p>
<p>9:33 And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of
her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he trode her
under foot.</p>
<p>9:34 And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see
now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king’s daughter.</p>
<p>9:35 And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than
the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</p>
<p>9:36 Wherefore they came again, and told him. And he said, This is
the word of the LORD, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite,
saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of
Jezebel:</p>
<p>9:37 And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the
field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is
Jezebel.</p>
