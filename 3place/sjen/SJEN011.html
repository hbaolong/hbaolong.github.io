第11章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>11:1 And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</p>
<p>11:2 And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they
found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.</p>
<p>11:3 And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn
them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for
morter.</p>
<p>11:4 And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose
top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be
scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
<p>11:5 And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the
children of men builded.</p>
<p>11:6 And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all
one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be
restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>
<p>11:7 Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that
they may not understand one another’s speech.</p>
<p>11:8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of
all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>
<p>11:9 Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did
there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the
LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.</p>
<p>11:10 These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years
old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</p>
<p>11:11 And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and
begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:12 And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</p>
<p>11:13 And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three
years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:14 And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>
<p>11:15 And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three
years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:16 And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>
<p>11:17 And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty
years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:18 And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>
<p>11:19 And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,
and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:20 And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>
<p>11:21 And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years,
and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:22 And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>
<p>11:23 And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and
begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:24 And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>
<p>11:25 And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen
years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>
<p>11:26 And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and
Haran.</p>
<p>11:27 Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,
Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</p>
<p>11:28 And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his
nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>
<p>11:29 And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram’s wife
was Sarai; and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran,
the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>
<p>11:30 But Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>
<p>11:31 And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his
son’s son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram’s wife; and they
went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of
Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.</p>
<p>11:32 And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and
Terah died in Haran.</p>
