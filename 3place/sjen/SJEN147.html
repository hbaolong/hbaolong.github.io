第 24章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>24:1 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the
elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the
governor against Paul.</p>
<p>24:2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,
saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very
worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</p>
<p>24:3 We accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with
all thankfulness.</p>
<p>24:4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray
thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</p>
<p>24:5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of
sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of
the sect of the Nazarenes:</p>
<p>24:6 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple: whom we took,
and would have judged according to our law.</p>
<p>24:7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great
violence took him away out of our hands,</p>
<p>24:8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom
thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse
him.</p>
<p>24:9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were
so.</p>
<p>24:10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to
speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a
judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</p>
<p>24:11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but
twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</p>
<p>24:12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,
neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the
city:</p>
<p>24:13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse
me.</p>
<p>24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they
call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things
which are written in the law and in the prophets:</p>
<p>24:15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow,
that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and
unjust.</p>
<p>24:16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience
void of offence toward God, and toward men.</p>
<p>24:17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and
offerings.</p>
<p>24:18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the
temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</p>
<p>24:19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they
had ought against me.</p>
<p>24:20 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil
doing in me, while I stood before the council,</p>
<p>24:21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among
them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by
you this day.</p>
<p>24:22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect
knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief
captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</p>
<p>24:23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have
liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister
or come unto him.</p>
<p>24:24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,
which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith
in Christ.</p>
<p>24:25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment
to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I
have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</p>
<p>24:26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,
that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and
communed with him.</p>
<p>24:27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix’ room: and
Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</p>
