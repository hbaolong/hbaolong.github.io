– 哥林多后书(2 7:1 Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let
us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,
perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</h4>
<p>7:2 Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we
have defrauded no man.</p>
<p>7:3 I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye
are in our hearts to die and live with you.</p>
<p>7:4 Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying
of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our
tribulation.</p>
<p>7:5 For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but
we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were
fears.</p>
<p>7:6 Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down,
comforted us by the coming of Titus;</p>
<p>7:7 And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he
was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your
mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more.</p>
<p>7:8 For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent,
though I did repent: for I perceive that the same epistle hath made you
sorry, though it were but for a season.</p>
<p>7:9 Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed
to repentance: for ye were made sorry after a godly manner, that ye
might receive damage by us in nothing.</p>
<p>7:10 For godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be
repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</p>
<p>7:11 For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly
sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of
yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement
desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have
approved yourselves to be clear in this matter.</p>
<p>7:12 Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause
that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that
our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.</p>
<p>7:13 Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and
exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit
was refreshed by you all.</p>
<p>7:14 For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed;
but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which
I made before Titus, is found a truth.</p>
<p>7:15 And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he
remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye
received him.</p>
<p>7:16 I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all
things.</p>
