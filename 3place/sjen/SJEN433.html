– 撒母耳记上(1 8:1 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he
made his sons judges over Israel.</h4>
<p>8:2 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.</p>
<p>8:3 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.</p>
<p>8:4 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and
came to Samuel unto Ramah,</p>
<p>8:5 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in
thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the nations.</p>
<p>8:6 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king
to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.</p>
<p>8:7 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee,
but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them.</p>
<p>8:8 According to all the works which they have done since the day
that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, wherewith they
have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do they also unto thee.</p>
<p>8:9 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that shall
reign over them.</p>
<p>8:10 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
asked of him a king.</p>
<p>8:11 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for himself,
for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some shall run before his
chariots.</p>
<p>8:12 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap his
harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and instruments of his
chariots.</p>
<p>8:13 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to be
cooks, and to be bakers.</p>
<p>8:14 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his servants.</p>
<p>8:15 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,
and give to his officers, and to his servants.</p>
<p>8:16 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his work.</p>
<p>8:17 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
servants.</p>
<p>8:18 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that day.</p>
<p>8:19 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel; and
they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;</p>
<p>8:20 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king may
judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.</p>
<p>8:21 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
them in the ears of the LORD.</p>
<p>8:22 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make
them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go ye every man
unto his city.</p>
