利未记(Leviticus) – 第 7章 ( 本篇共有 27章 )</h4>
<p>7:1 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
holy.</p>
<p>7:2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill
the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round
about upon the altar.</p>
<p>7:3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the
fat that covereth the inwards,</p>
<p>7:4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the
flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall
he take away:</p>
<p>7:5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering
made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.</p>
<p>7:6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten
in the holy place: it is most holy.</p>
<p>7:7 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one
law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have
it.</p>
<p>7:8 And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, even the
priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he
hath offered.</p>
<p>7:9 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that
is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that
offereth it.</p>
<p>7:10 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.</p>
<p>7:11 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
he shall offer unto the LORD.</p>
<p>7:12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the
sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and
unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine
flour, fried.</p>
<p>7:13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened
bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.</p>
<p>7:14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest’s that
sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.</p>
<p>7:15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall
not leave any of it until the morning.</p>
<p>7:16 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice:
and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:</p>
<p>7:17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day
shall be burnt with fire.</p>
<p>7:18 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings
be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither
shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an
abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.</p>
<p>7:19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be
eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be
clean shall eat thereof.</p>
<p>7:20 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him,
even that soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p>7:21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean
thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his
people.</p>
<p>7:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>7:23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.</p>
<p>7:24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye
shall in no wise eat of it.</p>
<p>7:25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an
offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall
be cut off from his people.</p>
<p>7:26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl
or of beast, in any of your dwellings.</p>
<p>7:27 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that
soul shall be cut off from his people.</p>
<p>7:28 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>7:29 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the
sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation
unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.</p>
<p>7:30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by
fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be
waved for a wave offering before the LORD.</p>
<p>7:31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast
shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.</p>
<p>7:32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an
heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.</p>
<p>7:33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace
offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part.</p>
<p>7:34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and
have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for
ever from among the children of Israel.</p>
<p>7:35 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in
the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s
office;</p>
<p>7:36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever
throughout their generations.</p>
<p>7:37 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and
of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the
consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;</p>
<p>7:38 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that
he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the
LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.</p>
