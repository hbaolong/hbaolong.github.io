– 历代记下(2 16:1 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa
Baasha king of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the
intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of
Judah.</h4>
<p>16:2 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of the
house of the LORD and of the king’s house, and sent to Benhadad king of
Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,</p>
<p>16:3 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my
father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go,
break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he may depart from
me.</p>
<p>16:4 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon, and Dan,
and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.</p>
<p>16:5 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
building of Ramah, and let his work cease.</p>
<p>16:6 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was building;
and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.</p>
<p>16:7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah, and
said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not
relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the host of the king of Syria
escaped out of thine hand.</p>
<p>16:8 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on the LORD, he
delivered them into thine hand.</p>
<p>16:9 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is
perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly: therefore from
henceforth thou shalt have wars.</p>
<p>16:10 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa
oppressed some of the people the same time.</p>
<p>16:11 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p>
<p>16:12 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his disease
he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.</p>
<p>16:13 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
fortieth year of his reign.</p>
<p>16:14 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was
filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices prepared by the
apothecaries’ art: and they made a very great burning for him.</p>
