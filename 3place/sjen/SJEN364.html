申命记(Deuteronomy) – 第 22章 ( 本篇共有 34章 )</h4>
<p>22:1 Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray, and
hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy
brother.</p>
<p>22:2 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with
thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou shalt restore it to him
again.</p>
<p>22:3 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou do
with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother’s, which he
hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise: thou mayest not
hide thyself.</p>
<p>22:4 Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fall down by the
way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help him to lift them
up again.</p>
<p>22:5 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment: for all that do so are
abomination unto the LORD thy God.</p>
<p>22:6 If a bird’s nest chance to be before thee in the way in any
tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs, and the dam
sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam
with the young:</p>
<p>22:7 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young to
thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy
days.</p>
<p>22:8 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a
battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine house, if
any man fall from thence.</p>
<p>22:9 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the
fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard,
be defiled.</p>
<p>22:10 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.</p>
<p>22:11 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen
and linen together.</p>
<p>22:12 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.</p>
<p>22:13 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,</p>
<p>22:14 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil
name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I
found her not a maid:</p>
<p>22:15 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and
bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the
city in the gate:</p>
<p>22:16 And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;</p>
<p>22:17 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her, saying,
I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the tokens of my
daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders
of the city.</p>
<p>22:18 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
him;</p>
<p>22:19 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and
give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath brought up an
evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not
put her away all his days.</p>
<p>22:20 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not
found for the damsel:</p>
<p>22:21 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her
father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that
she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore in
her father’s house: so shalt thou put evil away from among you.</p>
<p>22:22 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband,
then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman,
and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.</p>
<p>22:23 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and
a man find her in the city, and lie with her;</p>
<p>22:24 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city,
and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel, because
she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because he hath humbled
his neighbour’s wife: so thou shalt put away evil from among you.</p>
<p>22:25 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man
force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall
die:</p>
<p>22:26 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the
damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth against his
neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this matter:</p>
<p>22:27 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried,
and there was none to save her.</p>
<p>22:28 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not
betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be found;</p>
<p>22:29 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s
father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he
hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.</p>
<p>22:30 A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor discover his
father’s skirt.</p>
