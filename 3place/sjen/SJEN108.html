第 10章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>10:1 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door
into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief
and a robber.</p>
<p>10:2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the
sheep.</p>
<p>10:3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he
calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>
<p>10:4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them,
and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.</p>
<p>10:5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for
they know not the voice of strangers.</p>
<p>10:6 This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what
things they were which he spake unto them.</p>
<p>10:7 Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
I am the door of the sheep.</p>
<p>10:8 All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
sheep did not hear them.</p>
<p>10:9 I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
shall go in and out, and find pasture.</p>
<p>10:10 The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have
it more abundantly.</p>
<p>10:11 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep.</p>
<p>10:12 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the
sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth:
and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</p>
<p>10:13 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
for the sheep.</p>
<p>10:14 I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
mine.</p>
<p>10:15 As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
down my life for the sheep.</p>
<p>10:16 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I
must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold,
and one shepherd.</p>
<p>10:17 Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
that I might take it again.</p>
<p>10:18 No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This
commandment have I received of my Father.</p>
<p>10:19 There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
sayings.</p>
<p>10:20 And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye
him?</p>
<p>10:21 Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil.
Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?</p>
<p>10:22 And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was
winter.</p>
<p>10:23 And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.</p>
<p>10:24 Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long
dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.</p>
<p>10:25 Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works
that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.</p>
<p>10:26 But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
unto you.</p>
<p>10:27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow
me:</p>
<p>10:28 And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish,
neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.</p>
<p>10:29 My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man
is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.</p>
<p>10:30 I and my Father are one.</p>
<p>10:31 Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.</p>
<p>10:32 Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?</p>
<p>10:33 The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest
thyself God.</p>
<p>10:34 Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
are gods?</p>
<p>10:35 If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the
scripture cannot be broken;</p>
<p>10:36 Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into
the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?</p>
<p>10:37 If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</p>
<p>10:38 But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that
ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</p>
<p>10:39 Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of
their hand,</p>
<p>10:40 And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at
first baptized; and there he abode.</p>
<p>10:41 And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
all things that John spake of this man were true.</p>
<p>10:42 And many believed on him there.</p>
