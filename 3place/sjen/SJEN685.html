18章 ( 本篇共有 150章 )</h4>
<p>18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.</p>
<p>18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,
my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my
salvation, and my high tower.</p>
<p>18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall
I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p>18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men
made me afraid.</p>
<p>18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
prevented me.</p>
<p>18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he
heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into
his ears.</p>
<p>18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</p>
<p>18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</p>
<p>18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under
his feet.</p>
<p>18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
the wings of the wind.</p>
<p>18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</p>
<p>18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p>18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</p>
<p>18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
out lightnings, and discomfited them.</p>
<p>18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the
breath of thy nostrils.</p>
<p>18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many
waters.</p>
<p>18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated
me: for they were too strong for me.</p>
<p>18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
my stay.</p>
<p>18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
because he delighted in me.</p>
<p>18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</p>
<p>18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
departed from my God.</p>
<p>18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
his statutes from me.</p>
<p>18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
iniquity.</p>
<p>18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his
eyesight.</p>
<p>18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</p>
<p>18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward
thou wilt shew thyself froward.</p>
<p>18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
high looks.</p>
<p>18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten
my darkness.</p>
<p>18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
leaped over a wall.</p>
<p>18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</p>
<p>18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our
God?</p>
<p>18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
perfect.</p>
<p>18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds’ feet, and setteth me upon my high
places.</p>
<p>18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken
by mine arms.</p>
<p>18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</p>
<p>18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
slip.</p>
<p>18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
turn again till they were consumed.</p>
<p>18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
fallen under my feet.</p>
<p>18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</p>
<p>18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might
destroy them that hate me.</p>
<p>18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
LORD, but he answered them not.</p>
<p>18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</p>
<p>18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not
known shall serve me.</p>
<p>18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
shall submit themselves unto me.</p>
<p>18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close
places.</p>
<p>18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
salvation be exalted.</p>
<p>18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under
me.</p>
<p>18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the
violent man.</p>
<p>18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</p>
<p>18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</p>
