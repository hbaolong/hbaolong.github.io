第50章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>50:1 And Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept upon him, and
kissed him.</p>
<p>50:2 And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his
father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</p>
<p>50:3 And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the
days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him
threescore and ten days.</p>
<p>50:4 And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto
the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes,
speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</p>
<p>50:5 My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I
have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now
therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come
again.</p>
<p>50:6 And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he
made thee swear.</p>
<p>50:7 And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all
the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of
the land of Egypt,</p>
<p>50:8 And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father’s
house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they
left in the land of Goshen.</p>
<p>50:9 And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it
was a very great company.</p>
<p>50:10 And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond
Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation:
and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>
<p>50:11 And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the
mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to
the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is
beyond Jordan.</p>
<p>50:12 And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>
<p>50:13 For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried
him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the
field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before
Mamre.</p>
<p>50:14 And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all
that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his
father.</p>
<p>50:15 And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they
said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us
all the evil which we did unto him.</p>
<p>50:16 And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did
command before he died, saying,</p>
<p>50:17 So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the
trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil:
and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God
of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.</p>
<p>50:18 And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and
they said, Behold, we be thy servants.</p>
<p>50:19 And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of
God?</p>
<p>50:20 But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it
unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people
alive.</p>
<p>50:21 Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little
ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>
<p>50:22 And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and
Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</p>
<p>50:23 And Joseph saw Ephraim’s children of the third generation: the
children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon
Joseph’s knees.</p>
<p>50:24 And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely
visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware
to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>
<p>50:25 And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God
will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.</p>
<p>50:26 So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they
embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
