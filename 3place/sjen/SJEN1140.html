马太福音(Matthew) – 第 22章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>22:1 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
said,</p>
<p>22:2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a
marriage for his son,</p>
<p>22:3 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the
wedding: and they would not come.</p>
<p>22:4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are
bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are
killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</p>
<p>22:5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,
another to his merchandise:</p>
<p>22:6 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them
spitefully, and slew them.</p>
<p>22:7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth
his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</p>
<p>22:8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
which were bidden were not worthy.</p>
<p>22:9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,
bid to the marriage.</p>
<p>22:10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding
was furnished with guests.</p>
<p>22:11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man
which had not on a wedding garment:</p>
<p>22:12 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</p>
<p>22:13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and
take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping
and gnashing of teeth.</p>
<p>22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.</p>
<p>22:15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
entangle him in his talk.</p>
<p>22:16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of God
in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the
person of men.</p>
<p>22:17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
tribute unto Caesar, or not?</p>
<p>22:18 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye
me, ye hypocrites?</p>
<p>22:19 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a
penny.</p>
<p>22:20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
superscription?</p>
<p>22:21 They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render
therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the
things that are God’s.</p>
<p>22:22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
and went their way.</p>
<p>22:23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is
no resurrection, and asked him,</p>
<p>22:24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,
his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
brother.</p>
<p>22:25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto
his brother:</p>
<p>22:26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.</p>
<p>22:27 And last of all the woman died also.</p>
<p>22:28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
seven? for they all had her.</p>
<p>22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
scriptures, nor the power of God.</p>
<p>22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</p>
<p>22:31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,</p>
<p>22:32 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</p>
<p>22:33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
doctrine.</p>
<p>22:34 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
to silence, they were gathered together.</p>
<p>22:35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
tempting him, and saying,</p>
<p>22:36 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?</p>
<p>22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</p>
<p>22:38 This is the first and great commandment.</p>
<p>22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
as thyself.</p>
<p>22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.</p>
<p>22:41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked
them,</p>
<p>22:42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto
him, The son of David.</p>
<p>22:43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
Lord, saying,</p>
<p>22:44 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
make thine enemies thy footstool?</p>
<p>22:45 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?</p>
<p>22:46 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man
from that day forth ask him any more questions.</p>
