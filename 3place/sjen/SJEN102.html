<h4 id="新约-约翰福音john-第-4章-本篇共有-21章">新约 – 约翰福音(John) –
第 4章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>4:1 When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,</p>
<p>4:2 (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)</p>
<p>4:3 He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</p>
<p>4:4 And he must needs go through Samaria.</p>
<p>4:5 Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near
to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</p>
<p>4:6 Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with
his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.</p>
<p>4:7 There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto
her, Give me to drink.</p>
<p>4:8 (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)</p>
<p>4:9 Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the
Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.</p>
<p>4:10 Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest
have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</p>
<p>4:11 The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?</p>
<p>4:12 Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well,
and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?</p>
<p>4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
water shall thirst again:</p>
<p>4:14 But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall
never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well
of water springing up into everlasting life.</p>
<p>4:15 The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst
not, neither come hither to draw.</p>
<p>4:16 Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</p>
<p>4:17 The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto
her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:</p>
<p>4:18 For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is
not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</p>
<p>4:19 The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
prophet.</p>
<p>4:20 Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</p>
<p>4:21 Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when
ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the
Father.</p>
<p>4:22 Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
salvation is of the Jews.</p>
<p>4:23 But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall
worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such
to worship him.</p>
<p>4:24 God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.</p>
<p>4:25 The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.</p>
<p>4:26 Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.</p>
<p>4:27 And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou
with her?</p>
<p>4:28 The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the
city, and saith to the men,</p>
<p>4:29 Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is
not this the Christ?</p>
<p>4:30 Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.</p>
<p>4:31 In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,
eat.</p>
<p>4:32 But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not
of.</p>
<p>4:33 Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man
brought him ought to eat?</p>
<p>4:34 Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that
sent me, and to finish his work.</p>
<p>4:35 Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest?
behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for
they are white already to harvest.</p>
<p>4:36 And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice
together.</p>
<p>4:37 And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another
reapeth.</p>
<p>4:38 I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men
laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.</p>
<p>4:39 And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the
saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I
did.</p>
<p>4:40 So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him
that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.</p>
<p>4:41 And many more believed because of his own word;</p>
<p>4:42 And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy
saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed
the Christ, the Saviour of the world.</p>
<p>4:43 Now after two days he departed thence, and went into
Galilee.</p>
<p>4:44 For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in
his own country.</p>
<p>4:45 Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him,
having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for
they also went unto the feast.</p>
<p>4:46 So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the
water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at
Capernaum.</p>
<p>4:47 When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he
went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his
son: for he was at the point of death.</p>
<p>4:48 Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
will not believe.</p>
<p>4:49 The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child
die.</p>
<p>4:50 Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his
way.</p>
<p>4:51 And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
him, saying, Thy son liveth.</p>
<p>4:52 Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left
him.</p>
<p>4:53 So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole
house.</p>
<p>4:54 This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was
come out of Judaea into Galilee.</p>
