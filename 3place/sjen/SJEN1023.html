以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 32章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>32:1 And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,
in the first day of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me,
saying,</p>
<p>32:2 Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and
say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as
a whale in the seas: and thou camest forth with thy rivers, and
troubledst the waters with thy feet, and fouledst their rivers.</p>
<p>32:3 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will therefore spread out my net over
thee with a company of many people; and they shall bring thee up in my
net.</p>
<p>32:4 Then will I leave thee upon the land, I will cast thee forth
upon the open field, and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to
remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with
thee.</p>
<p>32:5 And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and fill the
valleys with thy height.</p>
<p>32:6 I will also water with thy blood the land wherein thou swimmest,
even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.</p>
<p>32:7 And when I shall put thee out, I will cover the heaven, and make
the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon
shall not give her light.</p>
<p>32:8 All the bright lights of heaven will I make dark over thee, and
set darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>32:9 I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring
thy destruction among the nations, into the countries which thou hast
not known.</p>
<p>32:10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their kings
shall be horribly afraid for thee, when I shall brandish my sword before
them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own
life, in the day of thy fall.</p>
<p>32:11 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The sword of the king of Babylon
shall come upon thee.</p>
<p>32:12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall,
the terrible of the nations, all of them: and they shall spoil the pomp
of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be destroyed.</p>
<p>32:13 I will destroy also all the beasts thereof from beside the
great waters; neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more, nor
the hoofs of beasts trouble them.</p>
<p>32:14 Then will I make their waters deep, and cause their rivers to
run like oil, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>32:15 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate, and the country
shall be destitute of that whereof it was full, when I shall smite all
them that dwell therein, then shall they know that I am the LORD.</p>
<p>32:16 This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the
daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her,
even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>32:17 It came to pass also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day
of the month, that the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>32:18 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them
down, even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, unto the nether
parts of the earth, with them that go down into the pit.</p>
<p>32:19 Whom dost thou pass in beauty? go down, and be thou laid with
the uncircumcised.</p>
<p>32:20 They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain by the
sword: she is delivered to the sword: draw her and all her
multitudes.</p>
<p>32:21 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst
of hell with them that help him: they are gone down, they lie
uncircumcised, slain by the sword.</p>
<p>32:22 Asshur is there and all her company: his graves are about him:
all of them slain, fallen by the sword:</p>
<p>32:23 Whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and her company
is round about her grave: all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which
caused terror in the land of the living.</p>
<p>32:24 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave, all
of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised
into the nether parts of the earth, which caused their terror in the
land of the living; yet have they borne their shame with them that go
down to the pit.</p>
<p>32:25 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain with all her
multitude: her graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised,
slain by the sword: though their terror was caused in the land of the
living, yet have they borne their shame with them that go down to the
pit: he is put in the midst of them that be slain.</p>
<p>32:26 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all her multitude: her graves are
round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword, though
they caused their terror in the land of the living.</p>
<p>32:27 And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the
uncircumcised, which are gone down to hell with their weapons of war:
and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their iniquities
shall be upon their bones, though they were the terror of the mighty in
the land of the living.</p>
<p>32:28 Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,
and shalt lie with them that are slain with the sword.</p>
<p>32:29 There is Edom, her kings, and all her princes, which with their
might are laid by them that were slain by the sword: they shall lie with
the uncircumcised, and with them that go down to the pit.</p>
<p>32:30 There be the princes of the north, all of them, and all the
Zidonians, which are gone down with the slain; with their terror they
are ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with them that be
slain by the sword, and bear their shame with them that go down to the
pit.</p>
<p>32:31 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all his
multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, saith the
Lord GOD.</p>
<p>32:32 For I have caused my terror in the land of the living: and he
shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain
with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, saith the Lord
GOD.</p>
