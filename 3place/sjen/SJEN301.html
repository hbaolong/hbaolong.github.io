启示录(Revelation) – 第 16章 ( 本篇共有 22章 )</h4>
<p>16:1 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven
angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon
the earth.</p>
<p>16:2 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth; and
there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark
of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image.</p>
<p>16:3 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the
sea.</p>
<p>16:4 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
fountains of waters; and they became blood.</p>
<p>16:5 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged
thus.</p>
<p>16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.</p>
<p>16:7 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.</p>
<p>16:8 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power
was given unto him to scorch men with fire.</p>
<p>16:9 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name
of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to
give him glory.</p>
<p>16:10 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their
tongues for pain,</p>
<p>16:11 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and
their sores, and repented not of their deeds.</p>
<p>16:12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings
of the east might be prepared.</p>
<p>16:13 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the
mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the
mouth of the false prophet.</p>
<p>16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them
to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</p>
<p>16:15 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.</p>
<p>16:16 And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew
tongue Armageddon.</p>
<p>16:17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne,
saying, It is done.</p>
<p>16:18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth,
so mighty an earthquake, and so great.</p>
<p>16:19 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities
of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God,
to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.</p>
<p>16:20 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not
found.</p>
<p>16:21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone
about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the
plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.</p>
