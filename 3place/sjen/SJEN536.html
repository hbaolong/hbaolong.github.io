– 历代记上(1 9:1 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and,
behold, they were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah,
who were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.</h4>
<p>9:2 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in
their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the
Nethinims.</p>
<p>9:3 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the
children of Benjamin, and of the children of Ephraim, and Manasseh;</p>
<p>9:4 Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the
son of Bani, of the children of Pharez the son of Judah.</p>
<p>9:5 And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons.</p>
<p>9:6 And of the sons of Zerah; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred
and ninety.</p>
<p>9:7 And of the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son
of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah,</p>
<p>9:8 And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and Elah the son of Uzzi, the son
of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son of Reuel, the
son of Ibnijah;</p>
<p>9:9 And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred
and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house
of their fathers.</p>
<p>9:10 And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,</p>
<p>9:11 And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of
God;</p>
<p>9:12 And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of
Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of
Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer;</p>
<p>9:13 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a
thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of
the service of the house of God.</p>
<p>9:14 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of
Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;</p>
<p>9:15 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of
Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;</p>
<p>9:16 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah, that dwelt
in the villages of the Netophathites.</p>
<p>9:17 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and
Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;</p>
<p>9:18 Who hitherto waited in the king’s gate eastward: they were
porters in the companies of the children of Levi.</p>
<p>9:19 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were
over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle:
and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the
entry.</p>
<p>9:20 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in time
past, and the LORD was with him.</p>
<p>9:21 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of
the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>9:22 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two
hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their
villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain in their set
office.</p>
<p>9:23 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the
house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards.</p>
<p>9:24 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north,
and south.</p>
<p>9:25 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come
after seven days from time to time with them.</p>
<p>9:26 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set
office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of
God.</p>
<p>9:27 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge
was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to
them.</p>
<p>9:28 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,
that they should bring them in and out by tale.</p>
<p>9:29 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all
the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and
the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.</p>
<p>9:30 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
spices.</p>
<p>9:31 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of
Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made
in the pans.</p>
<p>9:32 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were
over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.</p>
<p>9:33 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites,
who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that
work day and night.</p>
<p>9:34 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.</p>
<p>9:35 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife’s
name was Maachah,</p>
<p>9:36 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
Ner, and Nadab,</p>
<p>9:37 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.</p>
<p>9:38 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their
brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.</p>
<p>9:39 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat
Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.</p>
<p>9:40 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat
Micah.</p>
<p>9:41 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and
Ahaz.</p>
<p>9:42 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and
Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;</p>
<p>9:43 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,
Azel his son.</p>
<p>9:44 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru,
and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons
of Azel.</p>
