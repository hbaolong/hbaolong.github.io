出埃及记(Exodus) – 第 2章 ( 本篇共有 40章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a
daughter of Levi.</p>
<p>2:2 And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him
that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</p>
<p>2:3 And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark
of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child
therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink.</p>
<p>2:4 And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to
him.</p>
<p>2:5 And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the
river; and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she
saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it.</p>
<p>2:6 And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the
babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the
Hebrews’ children.</p>
<p>2:7 Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call
to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for
thee?</p>
<p>2:8 And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and
called the child’s mother.</p>
<p>2:9 And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away, and
nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the
child, and nursed it.</p>
<p>2:10 And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter,
and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said,
Because I drew him out of the water.</p>
<p>2:11 And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he
went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an
Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p>
<p>2:12 And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there
was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</p>
<p>2:13 And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the
Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong,
Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow?</p>
<p>2:14 And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses
feared, and said, Surely this thing is known.</p>
<p>2:15 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But
Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian:
and he sat down by a well.</p>
<p>2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and
drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock.</p>
<p>2:17 And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up
and helped them, and watered their flock.</p>
<p>2:18 And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it
that ye are come so soon to day?</p>
<p>2:19 And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the
shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock.</p>
<p>2:20 And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why is it that
ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread.</p>
<p>2:21 And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses
Zipporah his daughter.</p>
<p>2:22 And she bare him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he
said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.</p>
<p>2:23 And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt
died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and
they cried, and their cry came up unto God by reason of the bondage.</p>
<p>2:24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant
with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</p>
<p>2:25 And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect
unto them.</p>
