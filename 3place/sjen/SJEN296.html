启示录(Revelation) – 第 12章 ( 本篇共有 22章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed
with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of
twelve stars:</p>
<p>12:2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained
to be delivered.</p>
<p>12:3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great
red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his
heads.</p>
<p>12:4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did
cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was
ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was
born.</p>
<p>12:5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his
throne.</p>
<p>12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred
and threescore days.</p>
<p>12:7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,</p>
<p>12:8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
heaven.</p>
<p>12:9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the
Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into
the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</p>
<p>12:10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of
his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused
them before our God day and night.</p>
<p>12:11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word
of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.</p>
<p>12:12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe
to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come
down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a
short time.</p>
<p>12:13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.</p>
<p>12:14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that
she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is
nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the
serpent.</p>
<p>12:15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after
the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.</p>
<p>12:16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth,
and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.</p>
<p>12:17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and
have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>
