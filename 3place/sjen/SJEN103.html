第 5章 ( 本篇共有 21章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.</p>
<p>5:2 Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.</p>
<p>5:3 In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt,
withered, waiting for the moving of the water.</p>
<p>5:4 For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the
water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.</p>
<p>5:5 And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
eight years.</p>
<p>5:6 When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time
in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?</p>
<p>5:7 The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water
is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another
steppeth down before me.</p>
<p>5:8 Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p>5:9 And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and
walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.</p>
<p>5:10 The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</p>
<p>5:11 He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me,
Take up thy bed, and walk.</p>
<p>5:12 Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take
up thy bed, and walk?</p>
<p>5:13 And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had
conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.</p>
<p>5:14 Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto
thee.</p>
<p>5:15 The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had
made him whole.</p>
<p>5:16 And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.</p>
<p>5:17 But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
work.</p>
<p>5:18 Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father,
making himself equal with God.</p>
<p>5:19 Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the
Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son
likewise.</p>
<p>5:20 For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye
may marvel.</p>
<p>5:21 For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even
so the Son quickeneth whom he will.</p>
<p>5:22 For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son:</p>
<p>5:23 That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which
hath sent him.</p>
<p>5:24 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and
believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come
into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.</p>
<p>5:25 Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is,
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear
shall live.</p>
<p>5:26 For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the
Son to have life in himself;</p>
<p>5:27 And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because
he is the Son of man.</p>
<p>5:28 Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all
that are in the graves shall hear his voice,</p>
<p>5:29 And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation.</p>
<p>5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my
judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the
Father which hath sent me.</p>
<p>5:31 If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</p>
<p>5:32 There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the
witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</p>
<p>5:33 Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.</p>
<p>5:34 But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say,
that ye might be saved.</p>
<p>5:35 He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a
season to rejoice in his light.</p>
<p>5:36 But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works
which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear
witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</p>
<p>5:37 And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness
of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his
shape.</p>
<p>5:38 And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent,
him ye believe not.</p>
<p>5:39 Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal
life: and they are they which testify of me.</p>
<p>5:40 And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.</p>
<p>5:41 I receive not honour from men.</p>
<p>5:42 But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.</p>
<p>5:43 I am come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not: if another
shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.</p>
<p>5:44 How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and
seek not the honour that cometh from God only?</p>
<p>5:45 Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one
that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.</p>
<p>5:46 For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he
wrote of me.</p>
<p>5:47 But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my
words?</p>
