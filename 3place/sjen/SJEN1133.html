马太福音(Matthew) – 第 15章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>15:1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
Jerusalem, saying,</p>
<p>15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? for
they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</p>
<p>15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
the commandment of God by your tradition?</p>
<p>15:4 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He
that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</p>
<p>15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It
is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</p>
<p>15:6 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus
have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your
tradition.</p>
<p>15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</p>
<p>15:8 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth
me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</p>
<p>15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
commandments of men.</p>
<p>15:10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
understand:</p>
<p>15:11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</p>
<p>15:12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</p>
<p>15:13 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father
hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</p>
<p>15:14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</p>
<p>15:15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
parable.</p>
<p>15:16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</p>
<p>15:17 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</p>
<p>15:18 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from
the heart; and they defile the man.</p>
<p>15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</p>
<p>15:20 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with
unwashen hands defileth not a man.</p>
<p>15:21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre
and Sidon.</p>
<p>15:22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and
cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David; my
daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</p>
<p>15:23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</p>
<p>15:24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep
of the house of Israel.</p>
<p>15:25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</p>
<p>15:26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s
bread, and to cast it to dogs.</p>
<p>15:27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which
fall from their masters’ table.</p>
<p>15:28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made
whole from that very hour.</p>
<p>15:29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</p>
<p>15:30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that
were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at
Jesus’ feet; and he healed them:</p>
<p>15:31 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to
speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see:
and they glorified the God of Israel.</p>
<p>15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three
days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting,
lest they faint in the way.</p>
<p>15:33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</p>
<p>15:34 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they
said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</p>
<p>15:35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</p>
<p>15:36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the
multitude.</p>
<p>15:37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</p>
<p>15:38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
children.</p>
<p>15:39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into
the coasts of Magdala.</p>
