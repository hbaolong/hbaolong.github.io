约书亚记(Joshua) – 第 24章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>24:1 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their
judges, and for their officers; and they presented themselves before
God.</p>
<p>24:2 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God of
Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time,
even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they
served other gods.</p>
<p>24:3 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood,
and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed,
and gave him Isaac.</p>
<p>24:4 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau mount
Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went down into
Egypt.</p>
<p>24:5 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.</p>
<p>24:6 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and
horsemen unto the Red sea.</p>
<p>24:7 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and
your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and ye dwelt in the
wilderness a long season.</p>
<p>24:8 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt on
the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave them into
your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I destroyed them from
before you.</p>
<p>24:9 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse
you:</p>
<p>24:10 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you
still: so I delivered you out of his hand.</p>
<p>24:11 And ye went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men of
Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the
Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the
Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hand.</p>
<p>24:12 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with thy sword,
nor with thy bow.</p>
<p>24:13 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the vineyards and
oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.</p>
<p>24:14 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side
of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.</p>
<p>24:15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this
day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that
were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in
whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the
LORD.</p>
<p>24:16 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</p>
<p>24:17 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which
did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way
wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:</p>
<p>24:18 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve the LORD;
for he is our God.</p>
<p>24:19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your
transgressions nor your sins.</p>
<p>24:20 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you
good.</p>
<p>24:21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
LORD.</p>
<p>24:22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And they
said, We are witnesses.</p>
<p>24:23 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.</p>
<p>24:24 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
serve, and his voice will we obey.</p>
<p>24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</p>
<p>24:26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and
took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that was by the
sanctuary of the LORD.</p>
<p>24:27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the LORD which
he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny
your God.</p>
<p>24:28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
inheritance.</p>
<p>24:29 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten years
old.</p>
<p>24:30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill
of Gaash.</p>
<p>24:31 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the
works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.</p>
<p>24:32 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which
Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred
pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of
Joseph.</p>
<p>24:33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount
Ephraim.</p>
