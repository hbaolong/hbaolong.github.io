– 历代记下(2 4:1 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the
length thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits
the height thereof.</h4>
<p>4:2 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, round
in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a line of thirty
cubits did compass it round about.</p>
<p>4:3 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two rows of
oxen were cast, when it was cast.</p>
<p>4:4 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, and
three looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them, and
all their hinder parts were inward.</p>
<p>4:5 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies; and it
received and held three thousand baths.</p>
<p>4:6 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and five
on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered for the burnt
offering they washed in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash
in.</p>
<p>4:7 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form, and
set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the
left.</p>
<p>4:8 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on
the right side, and five on the left. And he made an hundred basons of
gold.</p>
<p>4:9 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them with
brass.</p>
<p>4:10 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
against the south.</p>
<p>4:11 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon for the
house of God;</p>
<p>4:12 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters
which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover
the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the
pillars;</p>
<p>4:13 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters
which were upon the pillars.</p>
<p>4:14 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;</p>
<p>4:15 One sea, and twelve oxen under it.</p>
<p>4:16 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all
their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon for the
house of the LORD of bright brass.</p>
<p>4:17 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.</p>
<p>4:18 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for the
weight of the brass could not be found out.</p>
<p>4:19 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God,
the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the shewbread was set;</p>
<p>4:20 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;</p>
<p>4:21 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of gold,
and that perfect gold;</p>
<p>4:22 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner doors
thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the house of the
temple, were of gold.</p>
