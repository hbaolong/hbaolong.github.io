– 历代记上(1 28:1 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the
princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered
to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands, and captains
over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the substance and
possession of the king, and of his sons, with the officers, and with the
mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.</h4>
<p>28:2 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me,
my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to build an
house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and for the
footstool of our God, and had made ready for the building:</p>
<p>28:3 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my name,
because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed blood.</p>
<p>28:4 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house of
my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath chosen Judah to
be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the house of my father; and
among the sons of my father he liked me to make me king over all
Israel:</p>
<p>28:5 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he
hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the
LORD over Israel.</p>
<p>28:6 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house
and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his
father.</p>
<p>28:7 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be
constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this day.</p>
<p>28:8 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the
LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for all the
commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess this good land,
and leave it for an inheritance for your children after you for
ever.</p>
<p>28:9 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the LORD
searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the
thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou
forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</p>
<p>28:10 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.</p>
<p>28:11 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,
and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and of the
upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours thereof, and of the
place of the mercy seat,</p>
<p>28:12 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the courts
of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round about, of the
treasuries of the house of God, and of the treasuries of the dedicated
things:</p>
<p>28:13 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for
all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for all the
vessels of service in the house of the LORD.</p>
<p>28:14 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all instruments of
silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</p>
<p>28:15 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the lamps
thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight, both for the
candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof, according to the use of
every candlestick.</p>
<p>28:16 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:</p>
<p>28:17 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the cups:
and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for every bason; and
likewise silver by weight for every bason of silver:</p>
<p>28:18 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold
for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread out their
wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</p>
<p>28:19 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing by
his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.</p>
<p>28:20 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD God, even my
God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee, until
thou hast finished all the work for the service of the house of the
LORD.</p>
<p>28:21 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of God: and
there shall be with thee for all manner of workmanship every willing
skilful man, for any manner of service: also the princes and all the
people will be wholly at thy commandment.</p>
