出埃及记(Exodus) – 第 38章 ( 本篇共有 40章 )</h4>
<p>38:1 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth thereof; it
was foursquare; and three cubits the height thereof.</p>
<p>38:2 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.</p>
<p>38:3 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans: all the
vessels thereof made he of brass.</p>
<p>38:4 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.</p>
<p>38:5 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass,
to be places for the staves.</p>
<p>38:6 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
brass.</p>
<p>38:7 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar,
to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with boards.</p>
<p>38:8 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass, of
the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled at the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation.</p>
<p>38:9 And he made the court: on the south side southward the hangings
of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred cubits:</p>
<p>38:10 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty; the
hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.</p>
<p>38:11 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty; the hooks
of the pillars and their fillets of silver.</p>
<p>38:12 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their
pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars and their
fillets of silver.</p>
<p>38:13 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.</p>
<p>38:14 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
their pillars three, and their sockets three.</p>
<p>38:15 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that
hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars three, and their
sockets three.</p>
<p>38:16 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
linen.</p>
<p>38:17 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of the
pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of their
chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court were filleted with
silver.</p>
<p>38:18 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and twenty cubits
was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits,
answerable to the hangings of the court.</p>
<p>38:19 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters and their
fillets of silver.</p>
<p>38:20 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
about, were of brass.</p>
<p>38:21 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for
the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the
priest.</p>
<p>38:22 And Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.</p>
<p>38:23 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in blue, and
in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.</p>
<p>38:24 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and nine
talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the shekel of the
sanctuary.</p>
<p>38:25 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and threescore and
fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:</p>
<p>38:26 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel
of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty
years old and upward, for six hundred thousand and three thousand and
five hundred and fifty men.</p>
<p>38:27 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets of the
hundred talents, a talent for a socket.</p>
<p>38:28 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and filleted
them.</p>
<p>38:29 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
thousand and four hundred shekels.</p>
<p>38:30 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle
of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the brasen grate for it,
and all the vessels of the altar,</p>
<p>38:31 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all the pins of
the court round about.</p>
