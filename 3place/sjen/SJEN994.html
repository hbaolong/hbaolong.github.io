以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 3章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>3:1 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat
this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</p>
<p>3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</p>
<p>3:3 And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill
thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it
was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>
<p>3:4 And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of
Israel, and speak with my words unto them.</p>
<p>3:5 For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an
hard language, but to the house of Israel;</p>
<p>3:6 Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language,
whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them,
they would have hearkened unto thee.</p>
<p>3:7 But the house of Israel will not hearken unto thee; for they will
not hearken unto me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and
hardhearted.</p>
<p>3:8 Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy
forehead strong against their foreheads.</p>
<p>3:9 As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear
them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a
rebellious house.</p>
<p>3:10 Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall
speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.</p>
<p>3:11 And go, get thee to them of the captivity, unto the children of
thy people, and speak unto them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</p>
<p>3:12 Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a
great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his
place.</p>
<p>3:13 I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that
touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and
a noise of a great rushing.</p>
<p>3:14 So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in
bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was
strong upon me.</p>
<p>3:15 Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by
the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there
astonished among them seven days.</p>
<p>3:16 And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of
the LORD came unto me, saying,</p>
<p>3:17 Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the house of
Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from
me.</p>
<p>3:18 When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou
givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked
way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity;
but his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
<p>3:19 Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his
wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but
thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
<p>3:20 Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness,
and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall
die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin,
and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but
his blood will I require at thine hand.</p>
<p>3:21 Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous
sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is
warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</p>
<p>3:22 And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said unto me,
Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</p>
<p>3:23 Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the
glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of
Chebar: and I fell on my face.</p>
<p>3:24 Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and
spake with me, and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine
house.</p>
<p>3:25 But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee,
and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</p>
<p>3:26 And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that
thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a
rebellious house.</p>
<p>3:27 But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou
shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him
hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious
house.</p>
