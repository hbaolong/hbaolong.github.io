第 19章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul
having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding
certain disciples,</p>
<p>19:2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye
believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether
there be any Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>19:3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they
said, Unto John’s baptism.</p>
<p>19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of
repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him
which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>19:5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord
Jesus.</p>
<p>19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came
on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</p>
<p>19:7 And all the men were about twelve.</p>
<p>19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space
of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the
kingdom of God.</p>
<p>19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil
of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated
the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</p>
<p>19:10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they
which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and
Greeks.</p>
<p>19:11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul:</p>
<p>19:12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs
or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits
went out of them.</p>
<p>19:13 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to
call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus,
saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</p>
<p>19:14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the
priests, which did so.</p>
<p>19:15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I
know; but who are ye?</p>
<p>19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and
overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that
house naked and wounded.</p>
<p>19:17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was
magnified.</p>
<p>19:18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their
deeds.</p>
<p>19:19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books
together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of
them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</p>
<p>19:20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</p>
<p>19:21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit,
when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,
saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</p>
<p>19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,
Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</p>
<p>19:23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</p>
<p>19:24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made
silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</p>
<p>19:25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation,
and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</p>
<p>19:26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost
throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much
people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:</p>
<p>19:27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at
nought; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be
despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and
the world worshippeth.</p>
<p>19:28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and
cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
<p>19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught
Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel,
they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</p>
<p>19:30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the
disciples suffered him not.</p>
<p>19:31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent
unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the
theatre.</p>
<p>19:32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the
assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were
come together.</p>
<p>19:33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting
him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made
his defence unto the people.</p>
<p>19:34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about
the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</p>
<p>19:35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men
of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the
Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image
which fell down from Jupiter?</p>
<p>19:36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye
ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</p>
<p>19:37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers
of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</p>
<p>19:38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,
have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies:
let them implead one another.</p>
<p>19:39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall
be determined in a lawful assembly.</p>
<p>19:40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s
uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this
concourse.</p>
<p>19:41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</p>
