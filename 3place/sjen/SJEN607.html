尼希米记(Nehemiah) – 第 5章 ( 本篇共有 13章 )</h4>
<p>5:1 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
against their brethren the Jews.</p>
<p>5:2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.</p>
<p>5:3 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
dearth.</p>
<p>5:4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s
tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</p>
<p>5:5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children
as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our
daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto
bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other
men have our lands and vineyards.</p>
<p>5:6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</p>
<p>5:7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the
rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.
And I set a great assembly against them.</p>
<p>5:8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even
sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their
peace, and found nothing to answer.</p>
<p>5:9 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in
the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our
enemies?</p>
<p>5:10 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</p>
<p>5:11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their
vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part
of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of
them.</p>
<p>5:12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and
took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</p>
<p>5:13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even
thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen,
and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this promise.</p>
<p>5:14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor
in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and
thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my
brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</p>
<p>5:15 But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable
unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty
shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people:
but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</p>
<p>5:16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the
work.</p>
<p>5:17 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews
and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that
are about us.</p>
<p>5:18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days
store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread of
the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</p>
<p>5:19 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
done for this people.</p>
