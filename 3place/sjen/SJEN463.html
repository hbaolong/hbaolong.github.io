– 撒母耳记下(2 7:1 And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house,
and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</h4>
<p>7:2 That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in
an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</p>
<p>7:3 And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart;
for the LORD is with thee.</p>
<p>7:4 And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came
unto Nathan, saying,</p>
<p>7:5 Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou
build me an house for me to dwell in?</p>
<p>7:6 Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I
brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but
have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</p>
<p>7:7 In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of
Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded
to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of
cedar?</p>
<p>7:8 Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith
the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the
sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</p>
<p>7:9 And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off
all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name,
like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.</p>
<p>7:10 Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will
plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no
more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as
beforetime,</p>
<p>7:11 And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also
the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</p>
<p>7:12 And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy
fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of
thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</p>
<p>7:13 He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the
throne of his kingdom for ever.</p>
<p>7:14 I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commit
iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes
of the children of men:</p>
<p>7:15 But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from
Saul, whom I put away before thee.</p>
<p>7:16 And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever
before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</p>
<p>7:17 According to all these words, and according to all this vision,
so did Nathan speak unto David.</p>
<p>7:18 Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said,
Who am I, O Lord GOD? and what is my house, that thou hast brought me
hitherto?</p>
<p>7:19 And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but
thou hast spoken also of thy servant’s house for a great while to come.
And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</p>
<p>7:20 And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord GOD,
knowest thy servant.</p>
<p>7:21 For thy word’s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou
done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</p>
<p>7:22 Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like
thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we
have heard with our ears.</p>
<p>7:23 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like
Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him
a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land,
before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the
nations and their gods?</p>
<p>7:24 For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a
people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</p>
<p>7:25 And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning
thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as
thou hast said.</p>
<p>7:26 And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of
hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be
established before thee.</p>
<p>7:27 For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy
servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant
found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</p>
<p>7:28 And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true,
and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</p>
<p>7:29 Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy
servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord
GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant
be blessed for ever.</p>
