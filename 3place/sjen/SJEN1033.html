以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 42章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>42:1 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward
the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the
separate place, and which was before the building toward the north.</p>
<p>42:2 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
the breadth was fifty cubits.</p>
<p>42:3 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
and over against the pavement which was for the utter court, was gallery
against gallery in three stories.</p>
<p>42:4 And before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward,
a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.</p>
<p>42:5 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of the
building.</p>
<p>42:6 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened more than
the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.</p>
<p>42:7 And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward
the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the length thereof was
fifty cubits.</p>
<p>42:8 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court was
fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred cubits.</p>
<p>42:9 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side, as
one goeth into them from the utter court.</p>
<p>42:10 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
toward the east, over against the separate place, and over against the
building.</p>
<p>42:11 And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers
which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they: and
all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and
according to their doors.</p>
<p>42:12 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the
south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly before
the wall toward the east, as one entereth into them.</p>
<p>42:13 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south
chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers,
where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall eat the most holy
things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat
offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place
is holy.</p>
<p>42:14 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of
the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their
garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on
other garments, and shall approach to those things which are for the
people.</p>
<p>42:15 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the east, and
measured it round about.</p>
<p>42:16 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred
reeds, with the measuring reed round about.</p>
<p>42:17 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
measuring reed round about.</p>
<p>42:18 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
measuring reed.</p>
<p>42:19 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
reeds with the measuring reed.</p>
<p>42:20 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation
between the sanctuary and the profane place.</p>
