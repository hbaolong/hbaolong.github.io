number of the workmen according to their service was:</h4>
<p>25:2 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied
according to the order of the king.</p>
<p>25:3 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and
Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their
father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to
praise the LORD.</p>
<p>25:4 Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel,
Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and
Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth:</p>
<p>25:5 All these were the sons of Heman the king’s seer in the words of
God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three
daughters.</p>
<p>25:6 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the
house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service
of the house of God, according to the king’s order to Asaph, Jeduthun,
and Heman.</p>
<p>25:7 So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed
in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred
fourscore and eight.</p>
<p>25:8 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the
great, the teacher as the scholar.</p>
<p>25:9 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second to
Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:</p>

twelve:</p>
<p>25:15 The eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
twelve:</p>

twelve:</p>

twelve:</p>
<p>25:18 The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
twelve:</p>
<p>25:19 The twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
twelve:</p>
<p>25:20 The thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
twelve:</p>
<p>25:21 The fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
were twelve:</p>
<p>25:22 The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
twelve:</p>
<p>25:23 The sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
twelve:</p>
<p>25:24 The seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his
brethren, were twelve:</p>
<p>25:25 The eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
twelve:</p>
<p>25:26 The nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren,
were twelve:</p>
