第25章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>25:1 Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</p>
<p>25:2 And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and
Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>
<p>25:3 And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were
Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</p>
<p>25:4 And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and
Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>
<p>25:5 And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</p>
<p>25:6 But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham
gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,
eastward, unto the east country.</p>
<p>25:7 And these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he
lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</p>
<p>25:8 Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an
old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</p>
<p>25:9 And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of
Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is
before Mamre;</p>
<p>25:10 The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there
was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>
<p>25:11 And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God
blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</p>
<p>25:12 Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom
Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</p>
<p>25:13 And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,
according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and
Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>
<p>25:14 And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>
<p>25:15 Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>
<p>25:16 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by
their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their
nations.</p>
<p>25:17 And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and
thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was
gathered unto his people.</p>
<p>25:18 And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as
thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his
brethren.</p>
<p>25:19 And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham
begat Isaac:</p>
<p>25:20 And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the
daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the
Syrian.</p>
<p>25:21 And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was
barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife
conceived.</p>
<p>25:22 And the children struggled together within her; and she said,
If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.</p>
<p>25:23 And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and
two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one
people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall
serve the younger.</p>
<p>25:24 And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there
were twins in her womb.</p>
<p>25:25 And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and
they called his name Esau.</p>
<p>25:26 And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on
Esau’s heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore
years old when she bare them.</p>
<p>25:27 And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the
field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>
<p>25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but
Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>
<p>25:29 And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was
faint:</p>
<p>25:30 And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same
red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.</p>
<p>25:31 And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>
<p>25:32 And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what
profit shall this birthright do to me?</p>
<p>25:33 And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:
and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>
<p>25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did
eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his
birthright.</p>
