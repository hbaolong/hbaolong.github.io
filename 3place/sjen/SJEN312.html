– 第 6章 ( 本篇共有 36章 )</h4>
<p>6:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>6:2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When either
man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to
separate themselves unto the LORD:</p>
<p>6:3 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and shall
drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he
drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes, or dried.</p>
<p>6:4 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is made
of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.</p>
<p>6:5 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he
separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the
locks of the hair of his head grow.</p>
<p>6:6 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall
come at no dead body.</p>
<p>6:7 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the
consecration of his God is upon his head.</p>
<p>6:8 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.</p>
<p>6:9 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled the
head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in the day of his
cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave it.</p>
<p>6:10 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
congregation:</p>
<p>6:11 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for that he
sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that same day.</p>
<p>6:12 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his
separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a trespass
offering: but the days that were before shall be lost, because his
separation was defiled.</p>
<p>6:13 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of the
tabernacle of the congregation:</p>
<p>6:14 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of
the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of
the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without
blemish for peace offerings,</p>
<p>6:15 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled
with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil, and their
meat offering, and their drink offerings.</p>
<p>6:16 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall offer
his sin offering, and his burnt offering:</p>
<p>6:17 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest shall
offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.</p>
<p>6:18 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the hair of
the head of his separation, and put it in the fire which is under the
sacrifice of the peace offerings.</p>
<p>6:19 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and
one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer, and
shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite, after the hair of his
separation is shaven:</p>
<p>6:20 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the
LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and heave
shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.</p>
<p>6:21 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that his hand
shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he must do after the
law of his separation.</p>
<p>6:22 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</p>
<p>6:23 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye
shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,</p>
<p>6:24 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:</p>
<p>6:25 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
thee:</p>
<p>6:26 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
peace.</p>
<p>6:27 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel; and I
will bless them.</p>
