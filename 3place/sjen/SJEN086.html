出埃及记(Exodus) – 第 36章 ( 本篇共有 40章 )</h4>
<p>36:1 Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted man,
in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding to know how to work all
manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that
the LORD had commanded.</p>
<p>36:2 And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise hearted
man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart
stirred him up to come unto the work to do it:</p>
<p>36:3 And they received of Moses all the offering, which the children
of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to
make it withal. And they brought yet unto him free offerings every
morning.</p>
<p>36:4 And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the
sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made;</p>
<p>36:5 And they spake unto Moses, saying, The people bring much more
than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to
make.</p>
<p>36:6 And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed
throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more
work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained
from bringing.</p>
<p>36:7 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make
it, and too much.</p>
<p>36:8 And every wise hearted man among them that wrought the work of
the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and
purple, and scarlet: with cherubims of cunning work made he them.</p>
<p>36:9 The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the
breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one
size.</p>
<p>36:10 And he coupled the five curtains one unto another: and the
other five curtains he coupled one unto another.</p>
<p>36:11 And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the
selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the uttermost side of
another curtain, in the coupling of the second.</p>
<p>36:12 Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in
the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the
loops held one curtain to another.</p>
<p>36:13 And he made fifty taches of gold, and coupled the curtains one
unto another with the taches: so it became one tabernacle.</p>
<p>36:14 And he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the
tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them.</p>
<p>36:15 The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits
was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one
size.</p>
<p>36:16 And he coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by
themselves.</p>
<p>36:17 And he made fifty loops upon the uttermost edge of the curtain
in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain
which coupleth the second.</p>
<p>36:18 And he made fifty taches of brass to couple the tent together,
that it might be one.</p>
<p>36:19 And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red,
and a covering of badgers’ skins above that.</p>
<p>36:20 And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing
up.</p>
<p>36:21 The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a
board one cubit and a half.</p>
<p>36:22 One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another:
thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle.</p>
<p>36:23 And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the
south side southward:</p>
<p>36:24 And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards;
two sockets under one board for his two tenons, and two sockets under
another board for his two tenons.</p>
<p>36:25 And for the other side of the tabernacle, which is toward the
north corner, he made twenty boards,</p>
<p>36:26 And their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board,
and two sockets under another board.</p>
<p>36:27 And for the sides of the tabernacle westward he made six
boards.</p>
<p>36:28 And two boards made he for the corners of the tabernacle in the
two sides.</p>
<p>36:29 And they were coupled beneath, and coupled together at the head
thereof, to one ring: thus he did to both of them in both the
corners.</p>
<p>36:30 And there were eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen
sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.</p>
<p>36:31 And he made bars of shittim wood; five for the boards of the
one side of the tabernacle,</p>
<p>36:32 And five bars for the boards of the other side of the
tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the sides
westward.</p>
<p>36:33 And he made the middle bar to shoot through the boards from the
one end to the other.</p>
<p>36:34 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.</p>
<p>36:35 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.</p>
<p>36:36 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and
overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast for them
four sockets of silver.</p>
<p>36:37 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;</p>
<p>36:38 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five sockets were
of brass.</p>
