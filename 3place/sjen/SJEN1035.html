以西结书(Ezekiel) – 第 44章 ( 本篇共有 48章 )</h4>
<p>44:1 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.</p>
<p>44:2 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall
not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the LORD, the
God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it shall be shut.</p>
<p>44:3 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat
bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that
gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.</p>
<p>44:4 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house of the
LORD: and I fell upon my face.</p>
<p>44:5 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold
with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto thee
concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD, and all the laws
thereof; and mark well the entering in of the house, with every going
forth of the sanctuary.</p>
<p>44:6 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it suffice
you of all your abominations,</p>
<p>44:7 In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers,
uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my
sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat
and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your
abominations.</p>
<p>44:8 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye have
set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.</p>
<p>44:9 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,
nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of any
stranger that is among the children of Israel.</p>
<p>44:10 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel
went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they
shall even bear their iniquity.</p>
<p>44:11 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they shall slay
the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall
stand before them to minister unto them.</p>
<p>44:12 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and
caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore have I
lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD, and they shall
bear their iniquity.</p>
<p>44:13 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in the most
holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and their abominations
which they have committed.</p>
<p>44:14 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for
all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done therein.</p>
<p>44:15 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray from me,
they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand
before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, saith the Lord
GOD:</p>
<p>44:16 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to
my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.</p>
<p>44:17 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates
of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no
wool shall come upon them, whiles they minister in the gates of the
inner court, and within.</p>
<p>44:18 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have
linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any
thing that causeth sweat.</p>
<p>44:19 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the
utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments wherein
they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers, and they shall put
on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their
garments.</p>
<p>44:20 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to
grow long; they shall only poll their heads.</p>
<p>44:21 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the
inner court.</p>
<p>44:22 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that
is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the house of
Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.</p>
<p>44:23 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and the
clean.</p>
<p>44:24 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they shall
judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep my laws and my
statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.</p>
<p>44:25 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves: but
for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or
for sister that hath had no husband, they may defile themselves.</p>
<p>44:26 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven
days.</p>
<p>44:27 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the inner
court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,
saith the Lord GOD.</p>
<p>44:28 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their
possession.</p>
<p>44:29 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel shall be
theirs.</p>
<p>44:30 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the priest’s:
ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may
cause the blessing to rest in thine house.</p>
<p>44:31 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.</p>
