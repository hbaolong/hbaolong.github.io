2章 ( 本篇共有 3章 )</h4>
<p>2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of
the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;</p>
<p>2:2 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick
darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a great people and a
strong; there hath not been ever the like, neither shall be any more
after it, even to the years of many generations.</p>
<p>2:3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth:
the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a
desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</p>
<p>2:4 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
horsemen, so shall they run.</p>
<p>2:5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as a
strong people set in battle array.</p>
<p>2:6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces
shall gather blackness.</p>
<p>2:7 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like
men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall
not break their ranks:</p>
<p>2:8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in
his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be
wounded.</p>
<p>2:9 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the
windows like a thief.</p>
<p>2:10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble:
the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their
shining:</p>
<p>2:11 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his camp
is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for the day of
the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</p>
<p>2:12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all
your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</p>
<p>2:13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of
great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</p>
<p>2:14 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD your
God?</p>
<p>2:15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
assembly:</p>
<p>2:16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts: let the
bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out of her closet.</p>
<p>2:17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the
porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and
give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over
them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their
God?</p>
<p>2:18 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his
people.</p>
<p>2:19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I
will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied
therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen:</p>
<p>2:20 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will
drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east
sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come
up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great
things.</p>
<p>2:21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do
great things.</p>
<p>2:22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and
the vine do yield their strength.</p>
<p>2:23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your
God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause
to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in
the first month.</p>
<p>2:24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall
overflow with wine and oil.</p>
<p>2:25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten,
the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army
which I sent among you.</p>
<p>2:26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the
name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my
people shall never be ashamed.</p>
<p>2:27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I
am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be
ashamed.</p>
<p>2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:</p>
<p>2:29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days
will I pour out my spirit.</p>
<p>2:30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood,
and fire, and pillars of smoke.</p>
<p>2:31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,
before the great and the terrible day of the LORD come.</p>
<p>2:32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name
of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall
be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom the LORD
shall call.</p>
