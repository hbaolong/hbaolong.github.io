耶利米哀歌(Lamentations) – 第 3章 ( 本篇共有 5章 )</h4>
<p>3:1 I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his
wrath.</p>
<p>3:2 He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into
light.</p>
<p>3:3 Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me
all the day.</p>
<p>3:4 My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my
bones.</p>
<p>3:5 He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and
travail.</p>
<p>3:6 He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.</p>
<p>3:7 He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my
chain heavy.</p>
<p>3:8 Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.</p>
<p>3:9 He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths
crooked.</p>
<p>3:10 He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret
places.</p>
<p>3:11 He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath
made me desolate.</p>
<p>3:12 He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</p>
<p>3:13 He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my
reins.</p>
<p>3:14 I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the
day.</p>
<p>3:15 He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with
wormwood.</p>
<p>3:16 He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered
me with ashes.</p>
<p>3:17 And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat
prosperity.</p>
<p>3:18 And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the
LORD:</p>
<p>3:19 Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the
gall.</p>
<p>3:20 My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in
me.</p>
<p>3:21 This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.</p>
<p>3:22 It is of the LORD’s mercies that we are not consumed, because
his compassions fail not.</p>
<p>3:23 They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.</p>
<p>3:24 The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in
him.</p>
<p>3:25 The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that
seeketh him.</p>
<p>3:26 It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the
salvation of the LORD.</p>
<p>3:27 It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.</p>
<p>3:28 He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it
upon him.</p>
<p>3:29 He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be
hope.</p>
<p>3:30 He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full
with reproach.</p>
<p>3:31 For the LORD will not cast off for ever:</p>
<p>3:32 But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according
to the multitude of his mercies.</p>
<p>3:33 For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of
men.</p>
<p>3:34 To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,</p>
<p>3:35 To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most
High,</p>
<p>3:36 To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not.</p>
<p>3:37 Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord
commandeth it not?</p>
<p>3:38 Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and
good?</p>
<p>3:39 Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment
of his sins?</p>
<p>3:40 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.</p>
<p>3:41 Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the
heavens.</p>
<p>3:42 We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not
pardoned.</p>
<p>3:43 Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast
slain, thou hast not pitied.</p>
<p>3:44 Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should
not pass through.</p>
<p>3:45 Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of
the people.</p>
<p>3:46 All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.</p>
<p>3:47 Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and
destruction.</p>
<p>3:48 Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction
of the daughter of my people.</p>
<p>3:49 Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any
intermission,</p>
<p>3:50 Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.</p>
<p>3:51 Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my
city.</p>
<p>3:52 Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.</p>
<p>3:53 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon
me.</p>
<p>3:54 Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.</p>
<p>3:55 I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.</p>
<p>3:56 Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at
my cry.</p>
<p>3:57 Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou
saidst, Fear not.</p>
<p>3:58 O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast
redeemed my life.</p>
<p>3:59 O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.</p>
<p>3:60 Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations
against me.</p>
<p>3:61 Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their
imaginations against me;</p>
<p>3:62 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device
against me all the day.</p>
<p>3:63 Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their
musick.</p>
<p>3:64 Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of
their hands.</p>
<p>3:65 Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.</p>
<p>3:66 Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of
the LORD.</p>
