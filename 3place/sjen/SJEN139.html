第 17章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>17:1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they
came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:</p>
<p>17:2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three
sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,</p>
<p>17:3 Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and
risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you,
is Christ.</p>
<p>17:4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas;
and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a
few.</p>
<p>17:5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them
certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set
all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought
to bring them out to the people.</p>
<p>17:6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain
brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the
world upside down are come hither also;</p>
<p>17:7 Whom Jason hath received: and these all do contrary to the
decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</p>
<p>17:8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when
they heard these things.</p>
<p>17:9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other,
they let them go.</p>
<p>17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night
unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</p>
<p>17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they
received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the
scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</p>
<p>17:12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which
were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</p>
<p>17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word
of God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and
stirred up the people.</p>
<p>17:14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it
were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</p>
<p>17:15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and
receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with
all speed, they departed.</p>
<p>17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was
stirred in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</p>
<p>17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with
the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with
him.</p>
<p>17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the
Stoicks, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say?
other some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he
preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</p>
<p>17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May
we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?</p>
<p>17:20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would
know therefore what these things mean.</p>
<p>17:21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent
their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new
thing.)</p>
<p>17:22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, Ye men of
Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.</p>
<p>17:23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar
with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly
worship, him declare I unto you.</p>
<p>17:24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he
is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with
hands;</p>
<p>17:25 Neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any
thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;</p>
<p>17:26 And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on
all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before
appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;</p>
<p>17:27 That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after
him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us:</p>
<p>17:28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain
also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.</p>
<p>17:29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to
think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by
art and man’s device.</p>
<p>17:30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now
commandeth all men every where to repent:</p>
<p>17:31 Because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the
world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he
hath given assurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the
dead.</p>
<p>17:32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some
mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</p>
<p>17:33 So Paul departed from among them.</p>
<p>17:34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the
which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and
others with them.</p>
