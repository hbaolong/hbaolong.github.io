第 26章 ( 本篇共有 28章 )</h4>
<p>26:1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for
thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for
himself:</p>
<p>26:2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for
myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused
of the Jews:</p>
<p>26:3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and
questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me
patiently.</p>
<p>26:4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;</p>
<p>26:5 Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that
after the most straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</p>
<p>26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made
of God unto our fathers:</p>
<p>26:7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day
and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews.</p>
<p>26:8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
should raise the dead?</p>
<p>26:9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things
contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</p>
<p>26:10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did
I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;
and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</p>
<p>26:11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them
to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them
even unto strange cities.</p>
<p>26:12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission
from the chief priests,</p>
<p>26:13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above
the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which
journeyed with me.</p>
<p>26:14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice
speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why
persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</p>
<p>26:15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom
thou persecutest.</p>
<p>26:16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto
thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of
these things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I
will appear unto thee;</p>
<p>26:17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto
whom now I send thee,</p>
<p>26:18 To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness
of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith that
is in me.</p>
<p>26:19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
heavenly vision:</p>
<p>26:20 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and
throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they
should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.</p>
<p>26:21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
about to kill me.</p>
<p>26:22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this
day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than
those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</p>
<p>26:23 That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that
should rise from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to
the Gentiles.</p>
<p>26:24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee
mad.</p>
<p>26:25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth
the words of truth and soberness.</p>
<p>26:26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak
freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</p>
<p>26:27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou
believest.</p>
<p>26:28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a
Christian.</p>
<p>26:29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all
that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am,
except these bonds.</p>
<p>26:30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the
governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them:</p>
<p>26:31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves,
saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</p>
<p>26:32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at
liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</p>
