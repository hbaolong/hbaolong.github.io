耶利米书(Jeremiah) – 第 40章 ( 本篇共有 52章 )</h4>
<p>40:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that
Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he
had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away
captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto
Babylon.</p>
<p>40:2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him,
The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.</p>
<p>40:3 Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath
said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his
voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.</p>
<p>40:4 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which
were upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into
Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto
thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is
before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go,
thither go.</p>
<p>40:5 Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon
hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among
the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So
the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him
go.</p>
<p>40:6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah;
and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</p>
<p>40:7 Now when all the captains of the forces which were in the
fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made
Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto
him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them
that were not carried away captive to Babylon;</p>
<p>40:8 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the
son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah
the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</p>
<p>40:9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto
them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in
the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with
you.</p>
<p>40:10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the
Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer
fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities
that ye have taken.</p>
<p>40:11 Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the
Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that
the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set
over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;</p>
<p>40:12 Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were
driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and
gathered wine and summer fruits very much.</p>
<p>40:13 Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the
forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah,</p>
<p>40:14 And said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the
king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay
thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not.</p>
<p>40:15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah
secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the
son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: wherefore should he slay
thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be
scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?</p>
<p>40:16 But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of
Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of
Ishmael.</p>
