第 12章 ( 本篇共有 24章 )</h4>
<p>12:1 In the mean time, when there were gathered together an
innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon
another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of
the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</p>
<p>12:2 For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed;
neither hid, that shall not be known.</p>
<p>12:3 Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard
in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall
be proclaimed upon the housetops.</p>
<p>12:4 And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of them that kill
the body, and after that have no more that they can do.</p>
<p>12:5 But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, which
after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you,
Fear him.</p>
<p>12:6 Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of
them is forgotten before God?</p>
<p>12:7 But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not
therefore: ye are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<p>12:8 Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him
shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God:</p>
<p>12:9 But he that denieth me before men shall be denied before the
angels of God.</p>
<p>12:10 And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it
shall be forgiven him: but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy
Ghost it shall not be forgiven.</p>
<p>12:11 And when they bring you unto the synagogues, and unto
magistrates, and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall
answer, or what ye shall say:</p>
<p>12:12 For the Holy Ghost shall teach you in the same hour what ye
ought to say.</p>
<p>12:13 And one of the company said unto him, Master, speak to my
brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.</p>
<p>12:14 And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider
over you?</p>
<p>12:15 And he said unto them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness:
for a man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he
possesseth.</p>
<p>12:16 And he spake a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a
certain rich man brought forth plentifully:</p>
<p>12:17 And he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do, because
I have no room where to bestow my fruits?</p>
<p>12:18 And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and
build greater; and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.</p>
<p>12:19 And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up
for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.</p>
<p>12:20 But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be
required of thee: then whose shall those things be, which thou hast
provided?</p>
<p>12:21 So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich
toward God.</p>
<p>12:22 And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take
no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what
ye shall put on.</p>
<p>12:23 The life is more than meat, and the body is more than
raiment.</p>
<p>12:24 Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which
neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feedeth them: how much more
are ye better than the fowls?</p>
<p>12:25 And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one
cubit?</p>
<p>12:26 If ye then be not able to do that thing which is least, why
take ye thought for the rest?</p>
<p>12:27 Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin
not; and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his glory was not
arrayed like one of these.</p>
<p>12:28 If then God so clothe the grass, which is to day in the field,
and to morrow is cast into the oven; how much more will he clothe you, O
ye of little faith?</p>
<p>12:29 And seek not ye what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,
neither be ye of doubtful mind.</p>
<p>12:30 For all these things do the nations of the world seek after:
and your Father knoweth that ye have need of these things.</p>
<p>12:31 But rather seek ye the kingdom of God; and all these things
shall be added unto you.</p>
<p>12:32 Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father’s good pleasure
to give you the kingdom.</p>
<p>12:33 Sell that ye have, and give alms; provide yourselves bags which
wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief
approacheth, neither moth corrupteth.</p>
<p>12:34 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</p>
<p>12:35 Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;</p>
<p>12:36 And ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when
he will return from the wedding; that when he cometh and knocketh, they
may open unto him immediately.</p>
<p>12:37 Blessed are those servants, whom the lord when he cometh shall
find watching: verily I say unto you, that he shall gird himself, and
make them to sit down to meat, and will come forth and serve them.</p>
<p>12:38 And if he shall come in the second watch, or come in the third
watch, and find them so, blessed are those servants.</p>
<p>12:39 And this know, that if the goodman of the house had known what
hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered
his house to be broken through.</p>
<p>12:40 Be ye therefore ready also: for the Son of man cometh at an
hour when ye think not.</p>
<p>12:41 Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto
us, or even to all?</p>
<p>12:42 And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward,
whom his lord shall make ruler over his household, to give them their
portion of meat in due season?</p>
<p>12:43 Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall
find so doing.</p>
<p>12:44 Of a truth I say unto you, that he will make him ruler over all
that he hath.</p>
<p>12:45 But and if that servant say in his heart, My lord delayeth his
coming; and shall begin to beat the menservants and maidens, and to eat
and drink, and to be drunken;</p>
<p>12:46 The lord of that servant will come in a day when he looketh not
for him, and at an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in
sunder, and will appoint him his portion with the unbelievers.</p>
<p>12:47 And that servant, which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not
himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many
stripes.</p>
<p>12:48 But he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes,
shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of
him shall be much required: and to whom men have committed much, of him
they will ask the more.</p>
<p>12:49 I am come to send fire on the earth; and what will I, if it be
already kindled?</p>
<p>12:50 But I have a baptism to be baptized with; and how am I
straitened till it be accomplished!</p>
<p>12:51 Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you,
Nay; but rather division:</p>
<p>12:52 For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided,
three against two, and two against three.</p>
<p>12:53 The father shall be divided against the son, and the son
against the father; the mother against the daughter, and the daughter
against the mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and
the daughter in law against her mother in law.</p>
<p>12:54 And he said also to the people, When ye see a cloud rise out of
the west, straightway ye say, There cometh a shower; and so it is.</p>
<p>12:55 And when ye see the south wind blow, ye say, There will be
heat; and it cometh to pass.</p>
<p>12:56 Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the
earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?</p>
<p>12:57 Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?</p>
<p>12:58 When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou
art in the way, give diligence that thou mayest be delivered from him;
lest he hale thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the
officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.</p>
<p>12:59 I tell thee, thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid
the very last mite.</p>
