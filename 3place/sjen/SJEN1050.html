但以理书(Daniel) – 第 11章 ( 本篇共有 12章 )</h4>
<p>11:1 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
confirm and to strengthen him.</p>
<p>11:2 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up
yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they
all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against
the realm of Grecia.</p>
<p>11:3 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
dominion, and do according to his will.</p>
<p>11:4 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his
posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom
shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</p>
<p>11:5 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his
dominion shall be a great dominion.</p>
<p>11:6 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for
the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to
make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm;
neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they
that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in
these times.</p>
<p>11:7 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress
of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall
prevail:</p>
<p>11:8 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their
princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he
shall continue more years than the king of the north.</p>
<p>11:9 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall
return into his own land.</p>
<p>11:10 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a
multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow,
and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his
fortress.</p>
<p>11:11 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall
come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north: and he
shall set forth a great multitude; but the multitude shall be given into
his hand.</p>
<p>11:12 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not
be strengthened by it.</p>
<p>11:13 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after
certain years with a great army and with much riches.</p>
<p>11:14 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king
of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt themselves to
establish the vision; but they shall fall.</p>
<p>11:15 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall not
withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any
strength to withstand.</p>
<p>11:16 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the
glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</p>
<p>11:17 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall
give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand
on his side, neither be for him.</p>
<p>11:18 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall
take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach
offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to
turn upon him.</p>
<p>11:19 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.</p>
<p>11:20 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the
glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be destroyed, neither
in anger, nor in battle.</p>
<p>11:21 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in
peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.</p>
<p>11:22 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the
covenant.</p>
<p>11:23 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small people.</p>
<p>11:24 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his
fathers’ fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and
riches: yea, and he shall forecast his devices against the strong holds,
even for a time.</p>
<p>11:25 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king
of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be
stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not
stand: for they shall forecast devices against him.</p>
<p>11:26 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down slain.</p>
<p>11:27 And both these kings’ hearts shall be to do mischief, and they
shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper: for yet the end
shall be at the time appointed.</p>
<p>11:28 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and
return to his own land.</p>
<p>11:29 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.</p>
<p>11:30 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the holy
covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have intelligence
with them that forsake the holy covenant.</p>
<p>11:31 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they
shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.</p>
<p>11:32 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt
by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be strong,
and do exploits.</p>
<p>11:33 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity, and by
spoil, many days.</p>
<p>11:34 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.</p>
<p>11:35 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end: because
it is yet for a time appointed.</p>
<p>11:36 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt
himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous
things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation
be accomplished: for that that is determined shall be done.</p>
<p>11:37 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself above
all.</p>
<p>11:38 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and silver, and
with precious stones, and pleasant things.</p>
<p>11:39 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he shall cause
them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.</p>
<p>11:40 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind,
with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many ships; and he shall
enter into the countries, and shall overflow and pass over.</p>
<p>11:41 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom,
and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.</p>
<p>11:42 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and
the land of Egypt shall not escape.</p>
<p>11:43 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the Libyans and
the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.</p>
<p>11:44 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy, and utterly
to make away many.</p>
<p>11:45 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and
none shall help him.</p>
