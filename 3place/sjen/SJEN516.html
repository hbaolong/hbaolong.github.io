– 列王记下(2 14:1 In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of
Israel reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah.</h4>
<p>14:2 He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and
reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was
Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>14:3 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet
not like David his father: he did according to all things as Joash his
father did.</p>
<p>14:4 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people
did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places.</p>
<p>14:5 And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his
hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father.</p>
<p>14:6 But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto
that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD
commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the
children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every
man shall be put to death for his own sin.</p>
<p>14:7 He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took
Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.</p>
<p>14:8 Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son
of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look one another in the
face.</p>
<p>14:9 And Jehoash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in
Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed
by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle.</p>
<p>14:10 Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thine heart hath lifted thee
up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to
thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?</p>
<p>14:11 But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of Israel
went up; and he and Amaziah king of Judah looked one another in the face
at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.</p>
<p>14:12 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel; and they fled
every man to their tents.</p>
<p>14:13 And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son
of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem,
and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the
corner gate, four hundred cubits.</p>
<p>14:14 And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that
were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king’s
house, and hostages, and returned to Samaria.</p>
<p>14:15 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his
might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of Judah, are they not
written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>14:16 And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria
with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead.</p>
<p>14:17 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.</p>
<p>14:18 And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in
the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</p>
<p>14:19 Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem: and he
fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him
there.</p>
<p>14:20 And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at Jerusalem
with his fathers in the city of David.</p>
<p>14:21 And all the people of Judah took Azariah, which was sixteen
years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.</p>
<p>14:22 He built Elath, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
slept with his fathers.</p>
<p>14:23 In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah
Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel began to reign in Samaria, and
reigned forty and one years.</p>
<p>14:24 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he
departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made
Israel to sin.</p>
<p>14:25 He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath
unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of
Israel, which he spake by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of
Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.</p>
<p>14:26 For the LORD saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very
bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for
Israel.</p>
<p>14:27 And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of Israel
from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of
Joash.</p>
<p>14:28 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and
his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath,
which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of
the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</p>
<p>14:29 And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of
Israel; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.</p>
