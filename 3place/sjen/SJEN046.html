第46章( 本篇共有50章)</h4>
<p>46:1 And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to
Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.</p>
<p>46:2 And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and said,
Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.</p>
<p>46:3 And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go
down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:</p>
<p>46:4 I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely
bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.</p>
<p>46:5 And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel carried
Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their wives, in the
wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</p>
<p>46:6 And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had
gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and all his
seed with him:</p>
<p>46:7 His sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his
sons’ daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into Egypt.</p>
<p>46:8 And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came
into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.</p>
<p>46:9 And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and
Carmi.</p>
<p>46:10 And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and
Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.</p>
<p>46:11 And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>
<p>46:12 And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,
and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of
Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.</p>
<p>46:13 And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and
Shimron.</p>
<p>46:14 And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.</p>
<p>46:15 These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in
Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons and his
daughters were thirty and three.</p>
<p>46:16 And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon, Eri,
and Arodi, and Areli.</p>
<p>46:17 And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and
Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber, and
Malchiel.</p>
<p>46:18 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his
daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.</p>
<p>46:19 The sons of Rachel Jacob’s wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.</p>
<p>46:20 And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and
Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On bare unto
him.</p>
<p>46:21 And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,
Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.</p>
<p>46:22 These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all the
souls were fourteen.</p>
<p>46:23 And the sons of Dan; Hushim.</p>
<p>46:24 And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and
Shillem.</p>
<p>46:25 These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his
daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were seven.</p>
<p>46:26 All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out
of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were threescore
and six;</p>
<p>46:27 And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two
souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were
threescore and ten.</p>
<p>46:28 And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face
unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</p>
<p>46:29 And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel
his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he fell on
his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</p>
<p>46:30 And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen
thy face, because thou art yet alive.</p>
<p>46:31 And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father’s house,
I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My brethren, and my
father’s house, which were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;</p>
<p>46:32 And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed
cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds, and all
that they have.</p>
<p>46:33 And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and
shall say, What is your occupation?</p>
<p>46:34 That ye shall say, Thy servants’ trade hath been about cattle
from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers: that ye
may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is an abomination
unto the Egyptians.</p>
