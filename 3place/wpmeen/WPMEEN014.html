<p>TEASER PREVIEW</p>
<p>What verb means to:</p>
<p>• belittle?</p>
<p>• be purposely confusing?</p>
<p>• tickle someone’s fancy?</p>
<p>• flatter fulsomely?</p>
<p>• prohibit some food or activity?</p>

<p>• give implicit forgiveness for a misdeed?</p>
<p>• change hostility to friendliness?</p>
<hr />
<p>SESSION 19</p>
<p>Verbs are incalculably useful to you.</p>
<p>Every sentence you think, say, read, or write contains an implied or
expressed verb, for it is the verb that carries the action, the
movement, the force of your ideas.</p>
<p>As a young child, you used verbs fairly early.</p>
<p>Your first words, of course, were probably nouns, as you identified
the things or people around you.</p>
<p>Mama, Dada, doll, baby, bottle, etc. perhaps were the first standard
syllables you uttered, for naming concrete things or real persons is the
initial step in the development of language.</p>
<p>Soon there came the ability to express intangible ideas, and then you
began to use simple verbs—go, stop, stay, want, eat, sleep, etc.</p>
<p>As you gained maturity, your verbs expressed ideas of greater and
greater complexity; as an adult you can describe the most involved
actions in a few simple syllables—if you have a good store of useful
verbs at your command.</p>
<p>The richer and more extensive your vocabulary of verbs, the more
accurately and expressively you can communicate your understanding of
actions, reactions, attitudes, and emotions.</p>
<p>Let’s be specific.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>playing it down</li>
</ol>
<p>Ready to go back thirty or more years? Consider some post-World War
II American political history:</p>
<p>Harry Truman couldn’t win the 1948 election. The pollsters said so,
the Republicans heartily agreed, even the Democrats, some in high
places, believed it. Mr. Truman himself was perhaps the only voter in
the country who was not entirely convinced.</p>
<p>Came the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November—well, if
you were one of those who stayed up most of the night listening to the
returns, and then kept your ear to the radio most of the next day, you
recall how you reacted to the unique Truman triumph.</p>
<p>It was no mean accomplishment, thought many people. Pure accident,
said others. If one out of twelve voters in a few key states had changed
his ballot, Harry could have gone back to selling ties, one Republican
apologist pointed out. It wasn’t anything Truman did, said another; it
was what Dewey didn’t do. No credit to Truman, said a third; it was the
farmers—or labor—or the Republicans who hadn’t bothered to vote—or the
ingenious miscounting of ballots. No credit to Truman, insisted a
fourth; it was Wallace’s candidacy—it was the Democrats—it was
Republican overconfidence—it was sunspots—it was the Communists—it was
the civil service workers who didn’t want to lose their cushy jobs—it
was really Roosevelt who won the election.</p>
<p>Anyway Harry didn’t accomplish a thing—he was just a victim of good
fortune.</p>
<p>What were the apologists for Dewey’s failure doing?</p>
<p>They were disparaging Truman’s achievement.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>playing it safe</li>
</ol>
<p>Willing to look at some more history of the late 1940s?</p>
<p>Of course, Dewey did campaign, in his own way, for the presidency. As
the Republican aspirant, he had to take a stand on the controversial
Taft-Hartley Act.</p>
<p>Was he for it? He was for that part of it which was good. Naturally,
he was against any of the provisions which were bad. Was he for it? The
answer was yes—and also no. Take whichever answer you wanted most to
hear.</p>
<p>What was Dewey doing?</p>
<p>He was equivocating.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>enjoying the little things</li>
</ol>
<p>Have you ever gone through a book that was so good you kept hugging
yourself mentally as you read? Have you ever seen a play or motion
picture that was so charming that you felt sheer delight as you watched?
Or perhaps you have had a portion of pumpkin-chiffon pie, light and airy
and mildly flavored, and with a flaky, delicious crust, that was the
last word in gustatory enjoyment?</p>
<p>Now notice the examples I have used. I have not spoken of books that
grip you emotionally, of plays and movies that keep you on the edge of
your seat in suspense, or of food that satisfies a ravenous hunger.
These would offer quite a different, perhaps more lasting and memorable,
type of enjoyment. I have detailed, rather, mental or physical stimuli
that excite enjoyably but not too sharply—a delightful novel, a charming
play, a delicious dessert.</p>
<p>How do such things affect you?</p>
<p>They titillate you.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>playing it way up</li>
</ol>
<p>You know how the teen-agers of an earlier generation adored,
idolized, and overwhelmed Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, the Beatles?</p>
<p>And of course you know how certain people fall all over visiting
celebrities—best-selling authors, much publicized artists, or famous
entertainers. They show them ingratiating, almost servile attention,
worship and flatter them fulsomely.1</p>
<p>How do we say it in a single word?</p>
<p>They adulate such celebrities.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>accentuating the negative</li>
</ol>
<p>What does the doctor say to you if you have low blood sugar? “No
candy, no pastries, no chocolate marshmallow cookies, no ice cream!”,
your morale dropping lower and lower as each favorite goody is placed on
the forbidden list.</p>
<p>What, in one word, is the doctor doing?</p>
<p>The doctor is proscribing harmful items in your diet.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>accentuating the affirmative</li>
</ol>
<p>You are warm, friendly, enthusiastic, outgoing, easy to please; you
are quick to show appreciation, yet accept, without judgment or
criticism, the human weaknesses of others.</p>
<p>You are a fascinating talker, an even better listener.</p>
<p>You believe in, and practice, honest self-disclosure; you feel
comfortable with yourself and therefore with everyone else; and you have
a passionate interest in experiencing, in living, in relating to
people.</p>
<p>Need you have any fears about making friends? Obviously not.</p>
<p>Your characteristics and temperament obviate such fears.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>playing it wrong</li>
</ol>
<p>Theodor Reik, in his penetrating book on psychoanalysis Listening
with the Third Ear, talks about neurotic people who unconsciously wish
to fail. In business interviews they say exactly the wrong words, they
do exactly the wrong things, they seem intent (as, unconsciously, they
actually are) on insuring failure in every possible way, though
consciously they are doing their best to court success.</p>
<p>What effect does such a neurotic tendency have?</p>
<p>It militates against success.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>playing it dirty</li>
</ol>
<p>“Harry?” He’s a closet alcoholic. Maud? She’s sleeping around—and her
stupid husband doesn’t suspect a thing. Bill? He’s embezzling from his
own company. Paul? He’s a child molester. Sally? You don’t know that
she’s a notorious husband-beater?”</p>
<p>What is this character doing?</p>
<p>He’s maligning everyone.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>giving the benefit of any doubt</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you think it’s all right to cheat on your income taxes? At least
just a little? It’s wrong, of course, but doesn’t everybody do it?</p>
<p>How do you feel about marital infidelity? Are you inclined to
overlook the occasional philandering of the male partner, since, after
all, to invent a cliché, men are essentially polygamous by nature?</p>
<p>If your answers are in the affirmative, how are you reacting to such
legal or ethical transgressions?</p>
<p>You condone them.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>changing hostility</li>
</ol>
<p>Unwittingly you have done something that has aroused anger and
resentment in your best friend. You had no desire to hurt him, yet he
makes it obvious that he feels pretty bitter about the whole situation.
(Perhaps you failed to invite him to a gathering he wanted to come to;
or you neglected to consult him before making a decision on a matter in
which he felt he should have some say.) His friendship is valuable to
you and you wish to restore yourself in his good graces. What do you
do?</p>
<p>You try to placate him.</p>

<p>Can you use the words?</p>
<p>In this exercise you gain the value of actually writing a new word as
a meaningful solution to a problem. To think about a word, to say it, to
write it, to use it—that is the road to word mastery. Write the verb
that best fits each situation.</p>

<p>(End of Session 19)</p>
<p>SESSION 20</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>equality</li>
</ol>
<p>If you play golf, you know that each course or hole has a certain
par, the number of strokes allowed according to the results achieved by
expert players. Your own accomplishment on the course will be at par,
above par, or below par.</p>
<p>Similarly, some days you may feel up to par, other days below
par.</p>
<p>Par is from a Latin word meaning equal. You may try, when you play
golf, to equal the expert score; and some days you may, or may not, feel
equal to your usual self.</p>
<p>When we speak of parity payments to farmers, we refer to payments
that show an equality to earnings for some agreed-upon year.</p>
<p>So when you disparage, you lower someone’s par, or feeling of
equality, (dis- as you know, may be a negative prefix). The noun is
disparagement (dis-PAIR′-Əj-mƏnt), the adjective disparaging
(dis-PAIR′-Əj-ing), as in “Why do you always make disparaging remarks
about me?”</p>
<p>Parity (PAIR′-Ə-tee) as a noun means equality; disparity
(dis-PAIR′-Ə-tee) means a lack of equality, or a difference. We may
speak, for example, of the disparity between someone’s promise and
performance; or of the disparity between the rate of vocabulary growth
of a child and of an adult. The adjective disparate (DIS′-pƏ-rƏt)
indicates essential or complete difference or inequality, as in “Our
philosophies are so disparate that we can never come to any agreement on
action.”</p>
<p>The word compare and all its forms (comparable, comparative, etc.)
derive from par, equal. Two things are compared when they have certain
equal or similar qualities, (con-, com-, together, with).</p>
<p>Pair and peer are also from par. Things (shoes, socks, gloves, etc.)
in pairs are equal or similar; your peers are those equal to you, as in
age, position, rank, or ability. Hence the expression “to be judged by a
jury of one’s peers.”</p>
<p>(British peers, however, such is the contradiction of language, were
nobles.)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>how to say yes and no</li>
</ol>
<p>Equivocate is built on another Latin word meaning equal—aequus (the
spelling in English is always equ-)—plus vox, vocis, voice.</p>
<p>When you equivocate (Ə-KWIV′-Ə-kayt′), you seem to be saying both yes
and no with equal voice. An equivocal (Ə-KWIV′-Ə-kƏl) answer, therefore,
is by design vague, indefinite, and susceptible of contradictory
interpretations, quite the opposite of an unequivocal
(un′-Ə-KWIV′-Ə-kƏl) response, which says Yes! or No!, and no kidding.
Professional politicians are masters of equivocation
(Ə-kwiv′-Ə-KAY′-shƏn)—they are, on most vital issues, mugwumps; they sit
on a fence with their mugs on one side and their wumps on the other. You
will often hear candidates for office say, publicly, that they
unequivocally promise, if elected, to…; and then they start equivocating
for all they are worth, like people who say, “Let me be perfectly frank
with you”—and then promptly and glibly lie through their teeth.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>statements of various kinds</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not confuse equivocal with ambiguous (am′-BIG′-y-Əs). An equivocal
statement is purposely, deliberately (and with malice aforethought)
couched in language that will be deceptive; an ambiguous statement is
accidentally couched in such language. Equivocal is, in short, purposely
ambiguous.</p>
<p>You will recall that ambi-, which we last met in ambivert and
ambidextrous, is a root meaning both; anything ambiguous may have both
one meaning and another meaning. If you say, “That sentence is the
height of ambiguity,” you mean that you find it vague because it admits
of both affirmative and negative interpretations, or because it may mean
two different things. Ambiguity is pronounced am′-bƏ-GY-Ə-tee.</p>
<p>Another type of statement or word contains the possibility of two
interpretations—one of them suggestive, risqué, or sexy. Such a
statement or word is a double entendre. This is from the French and
translates literally as double meaning. Give the word as close a french
pronunciation as you can—DB′-lƏhn-TAHN′-drƏ. (The n’s are nasalized, the
r somewhat throaty, and the final syllable is barely audible.)</p>

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>more on equality</li>
</ol>
<p>The root aequus, spelled equ- in English words, is a building block
of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>equity (EK′-wƏ-tee)—justice, fairness; i.e., equal treatment. (By
extension, stocks in the financial markets are equities, and the value
of your home or other property over and above the amount of the mortgage
you owe is your equity in it.) The adjective is equitable
(EK′-wƏ-tƏ-bƏl).</p></li>
<li><p>inequity (in-EK′-wƏ-tee)—injustice, unfairness (equity plus the
negative prefix in-). Adjective: inequitable
(in-EK′-wƏ-tƏ-bƏl).</p></li>
<li><p>iniquity (in-IK′-wƏ-tee)—by one of those delightful surprises and
caprices characteristic of language, the change of a single letter (e to
i), extends the meaning of a word far beyond its derivation and original
denotation. Injustice and unfairness are sinful and wicked, especially
if you naïvely believe that life is fair. So a “den of iniquity” is a
place where vice flourishes; an iniquity is a sin or vice, or an
egregiously immoral act; and iniquity is wickedness, sinfulness.
Adjective: iniquitous (in-IK′-wƏ-tƏs).</p></li>
<li><p>equinox (EE′-kwƏ-noks′)—etymologically, “equal night,” a
combination of aequus and nox, noctis, night. The equinox, when day and
night are of equal length, occurs twice a year: about March 21, and
again about September 21 or 22. (The adjective is
equinoctial—ee′-kwƏ-NOK′-shƏl.) Nocturnal (nok-TURN′-Əl), derived from
nox, noctis, describes people, animals, or plants that are active or
flourish at night rather than during daylight hours. Cats and owls are
nocturnal, as is the moonflower, whose blossoms open at night; not to
mention “night people,” whose biorhythms are such that they function
better after the sun goes down, and who like to stay up late and sleep
well into midmorning. A nocturne (NOK′-turn) is a musical composition of
dreamy character (i.e., night music), or a painting of a night
scene.</p></li>
<li><p>equanimity (ee′-kwƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee or
ek′-wƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee)—etymologically aequus plus animus, mind, hence “equal
mind.” Maintain your equanimity, your evenness of temper, your
composure, your coolness or calmness, when everyone around you is
getting excited or hysterical, and you will probably be considered an
admirable person, though one might wonder what price you pay for such
emotional control. (Other words built on animus, mind, will be discussed
in Chapter 12.)</p></li>
<li><p>Equability (ee′-kwƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee or ek′-wƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee)—a close
synonym of equanimity. A person of equable (EE′-kwƏ-bƏl or EK′-wƏ-bƏl)
temperament is characteristically calm, serene, unflappable,
even-tempered.</p></li>
<li><p>equilibrium (ee′-kwƏ-LIB′-ree-Əm)—by derivation aequus plus
libra, balance, weight, pound, hence “equal balance.” Libra (LĪ′-brƏ) is
the seventh sign of the zodiac, represented by a pair of scales. Now you
know, in case the question has been bothering you, why the abbreviation
for the word pound is lb. and why the symbol for the British pound, the
monetary unit, is £. Equilibrium is a state of physical balance,
especially between opposing forces. When you are very drunk you may have
difficulty keeping your equilibrium—the force of gravity is stronger
than your ability to stay upright. An equilibrist (Ə-KWIL′-Ə-brist), as
you might guess, is a professional tightrope walker—a performer
successfully defying the law of gravity (when sober) by balancing on a
thin overhead wire.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The equator divides the earth into equal halves, and words like
equation, equivalent, equidistant, equiangular, and equilateral (from
Latin latus, lateris, side) are self-explanatory.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>not to be confused with horses</li>
</ol>
<p>Equestrian (Ə-KWES′-tree-Ən) is someone on a horse (as pedestrian is
someone on foot); an equestrienne (Ə-kwes′-tree-EN′) is a woman on a
horse (if you must make the distinction); and equine (EE′-kwīn) is like
a horse, as in appearance or characteristics, or descriptive of
horses.</p>
<p>Equestrian is also an adjective referring to horseback riding, as an
equestrian statue; and equine is also a noun, i.e., a horse.</p>
<p>So the equ- in these words, from Latin equus, horse, is not to be
confused with the equ- in the words of the previous section—that equ- is
from aequus, equal. (Remember, also, not to confuse the ped- in
pedestrian, from Latin pedis, foot, with the ped- in pediatrician, from
Greek paidos, child.)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>hear voices?</li>
</ol>
<p>Equivocal, you will recall, combines aequus with vox, vocis, voice;
and vox, vocis combines with fero, to bear or carry, to form vociferous
(vō-SIF′-Ər-Əs), etymologically “carrying (much) voice,” hence loud,
noisy, clamorous, as vociferous demands (not at all quiet or subtle), or
the vociferous play of young children (“Please! Try to be quiet so Dad
can get his work done!”), though unfortunately TV addiction has
abnormally eliminated child noises, at least during the program breaks
between commercials. (Vociferous will be discussed at greater length in
Chapter 10.)</p>
<p>If you are vocal (VŌ′-kƏl), you express yourself readily and freely
by voice; vocal sounds are voiced; vocal music is sung; and you know
what your vocal cords are for.</p>
<p>To vocalize (VŌ′-kƏ-līz′) is to give voice to (“Vocalize your anger,
don’t hold it in!”), or to sing the vocals (or voice parts) of music.
(Can you write the noun form of the verb vocalize? __________________.)
A vocalist (VŌ′-kƏ-list) is a singer. And Magnavox (vox plus magnus,
large) is the trade name for a brand of radios and TV sets.</p>

<p>Titillate comes from a Latin verb meaning to tickle, and may be used
both literally and figuratively. That is (literally), you can titillate
by gentle touches in strategic places; you are then causing an actual
(and always very pleasant) physical sensation. Or you can (figuratively)
titillate people, or their minds, fancies, palates (and this is the more
common use of the word), by charm, brilliance, wit, promises, or in any
other way your imagination can conceive.</p>
<p>Titillation (tit′-Ə-LAY′-shƏn) has the added meaning of light sexual
stimulation. (Note that both noun and verb are spelled with a double I,

<li>how to flatter</li>
</ol>
<p>A compliment is a pleasant and courteous expression of praise;
flattery is stronger than a compliment and often considered insincere.
Adulation (aj′-Ə-LAY′-shƏn) is flattery and worship carried to an
excessive, ridiculous degree. There are often public figures
(entertainers, musicians, government officials, etc.) who receive
widespread adulation, but those not in the public eye can also be
adulated, as a teacher by students, a wife by husband (and vice versa),
a doctor by patients, and so on. (The derivation is from a Latin verb
meaning to fawn upon.)</p>
<p>The adjective adulatory (aj′-Ə-lƏ-TAWR′-ee) ends in -ory, a suffix we
are meeting for the first time in these pages. (Other adjective
suffixes: -al, -ic, -ical, -ous.)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>ways of writing</li>
</ol>
<p>Proscribe, to forbid, is commonly used for medical, religious, or
legal prohibitions.</p>
<p>A doctor proscribes a food, drug, or activity that might prove
harmful to the patient. The church proscribes, or announces a
proscription (prō-SKRIP′-shƏn) against, such activities as may harm its
parishioners. The law proscribes behavior detrimental to the public
welfare.</p>
<p>Generally, one might concede, proscribed activities are the most
pleasant ones—as Alexander Woolcott once remarked, if something is
pleasurable, it’s sure to be either immoral, illegal, or fattening.</p>
<p>The derivation is the prefix pro-, before, plus scribo, scriptus, to
write. In ancient Roman times, a man’s name was written on a public
bulletin board if he had committed some crime for which his property or
life was to be forfeited; Roman citizens in good standing would thereby
know to avoid him. In a similar sense, the doctor writes down those
foods or activities that are likely to commit crimes against the
patient’s health—in that way the patient knows to avoid them.</p>
<p>Scribo, scriptus is the building block of scores of common English
words: scribe, scribble, prescribe, describe, subscribe, script, the
Scriptures, manuscript, typescript, etc. Describe uses the prefix de-,
down—to describe is, etymologically, “to write down” about. Manuscript,
combining manus, hand (as in manual labor), with scriptus, is something
handwritten—the word was coined before the invention of the typewriter.
The Scriptures are holy writings. To subscribe (as to a magazine) is to
write one’s name under an order or contract (sub-, under, as in subway,
subsurface, etc.); to subscribe to a philosophy or a principle is
figuratively to write one’s name under the statement of such philosophy
or principle.</p>
<p>To inscribe is to write in or into (a book, for example, or metal or
stone). A postscript is something written after (Latin post, after) the
main part is finished.</p>
<p>Note how -scribe verbs change to nouns and adjectives:</p>
<p>VERB NOUN ADJECTIVE</p>

<p>subscribe subscription subscriptive</p>

<li>it’s obvious</li>
</ol>
<p>You are familiar with the word via, by way of, which is from the
Latin word for road. (The Via Appia was one of the famous highways of
ancient Roman times.) When something is obvious, etymologically it is
right there in the middle of the road where no one can fail to see
it—hence, easily seen, not hidden, conspicuous. And if you meet an
obstacle in the road and dispose of it forthwith, you are doing what
obviate says. Thus, if you review your work daily in some college
subject, frenzied “cramming” at the end of the semester will be
obviated. A large and steady income obviates fears of financial
insecurity; leaving for work early will obviate worry about being late.
To obviate, then, is to make unnecessary, to do away with, to prevent by
taking effective measures or steps against (an occurrence, a feeling, a
requirement, etc.). The noun is obviation (ob′-vee-AY′-shƏn).</p>
<p>Surprisingly, via, road, is the root in the English word trivial
(tri-, three). Where three roads intersect, you are likely to find busy
traffic, lots of people, in short a fairly public place, so you are not
going to talk of important or confidential matters, lest you be
overheard. You will, instead, talk of trivial (TRIV′-ee-Əl)
things—whatever is unimportant, without great significance; you will
confine your conversation to trivialities (triv′-ee-AL′-Ə-teez) or to
trivia (also a plural noun, pronounced TRIV′-ee-Ə), insignificant
trifles.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>war</li>
</ol>
<p>Militate derives from militis, one of the forms of the Latin noun
meaning soldier or fighting man. If something militates against you, it
fights against you, i.e., works to your disadvantage. Thus, your
timidity may militate against your keeping your friends. (Militate is
always followed by the preposition against and, like obviate, never
takes a personal subject—you don’t militate against anyone, but some
habit, action, tendency, etc. militates against someone or
something.)</p>
<p>The adjective militant (MIL′-Ə-tƏnt) comes from the same root. A
militant reformer is one who fights for reforms; a militant campaign is
one waged aggressively and with determination. The noun is militancy
(MIL′-Ə-tƏn-see), and militant is also a noun for the person—“Sally is a
militant in the Women’s Liberation movement.”</p>
<p>Military and militia also have their origin in militis.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>first the bad news</li>
</ol>
<p>Built on Latin malus, bad, evil, to malign is to speak evil about, to
defame, to slander. Malign is also an adjective meaning bad, harmful,
evil, hateful, as in “the malign influence of his unconscious will to
fail.” Another adjective form is malignant (mƏ-LIG′-nƏnt), as in “a
malignant glance,” i.e., one showing deep hatred, or “a malignant
growth,” i.e., one that is cancerous (bad).</p>
<p>The noun of malignant is malignancy (mƏ-LIG′-nƏn-see), which,
medically, is a cancerous growth, or, generally, the condition, state,
or attitude of harmfulness, hatefulness, evil intent, etc. The noun form
of the adjective malign is malignity (mƏ-LIG′-nƏ-tee).</p>
<p>Observe how we can construct English words by combining malus with
other Latin roots.</p>
<p>Add the root dico, dictus, to say or tell, to form malediction
(mal′-Ə-DIK′-shƏn), a curse, i.e., an evil saying. Adjective:
maledictory (mal′-Ə-DIK′-tƏ-ree).</p>
<p>Add the root volo, to wish, to will, or to be willing, and we can
construct the adjective malevolent (mƏ-LEV′-Ə-lent), wishing evil or
harm—a malevolent glance, attitude, feeling, etc. The noun is
malevolence (mƏ-LEV′-Ə-lƏns).</p>
<p>Add the root facio, factus, to do or make (also spelled, in English
words, fec-, fic-, factus, or, as a verb ending, -fy), to form the
adjective maleficent (mƏ-LEF′-Ə-sƏnt), doing harm or evil, or causing
hurt—maleficent acts, deeds, behavior.</p>
<p>Can you figure out, and pronounce, the noun form of maleficent?
__________________.</p>
<p>A malefactor (MAL′-Ə-fak′-tƏr) is a wrongdoer, an evildoer, a
criminal—a malefactor commits a malefaction (mal′-Ə-FAK′-shƏn), a crime,
an evil deed.</p>
<p>French is a “Romance” language, that is, a language based on Roman or
Latin (as are, also, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, and Romanian), and so
Latin malus became French mal, bad, the source of maladroit
(mal′-Ə-DROYT′), clumsy, bungling, awkward, unskillful, etymologically,
having a “bad right hand.” (See adroit, Chapter 3.) The noun is
maladroitness. Also from French mal: malaise (mƏ-LAYZ′), an indefinite
feeling of bodily discomfort, as in a mild illness, or as a symptom
preceding an illness; etymologically, “bad ease,” just as disease
(dis-ease) is “lack of ease.”</p>
<p>Other common words that you are familiar with also spring from Latin
malus: malicious, malice, malady; and the same malus functions as a
prefix in words like maladjusted, malcontent, malpractice, malnutrition,
etc., all with the connotation of badness.</p>

<p>SESSION 23</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>so now what’s the good news?</li>
</ol>
<p>Malus is bad; bonus is good. The adverb from the Latin adjective
bonus is bene, and bene is the root found in words that contrast with
the mal- terms we studied in the previous session.</p>
<p>So benign (bƏ-NĪN′) and benignant (bƏ-NIG′-nƏnt) are kindly,
good-natured, not harmful, as in benign neglect, a benign judge, a
benign tumor (not cancerous), a benignant attitude to malefactors and
scoundrels. The corresponding nouns are benignity (bƏ-NIG′-nƏ-tee) and
benignancy (bƏ-NIG′-nƏn-see).</p>
<p>A malediction is a curse; a benediction (ben′-Ə-DIK′-shƏn) is a
blessing, a “saying good.” The adjective is benedictory
(ben′-Ə-DIK′-tƏ-ree).</p>
<p>In contrast to maleficent is beneficent (bƏ-NEF′-Ə-sƏnt), doing good.
The noun? __________________.</p>
<p>In contrast to malefactor is benefactor (BEN′-Ə-fak′-tƏr), one who
does good things for another, as by giving help, providing financial
gifts or aid, or coming to the rescue when someone is in need. If you
insist on making sexual distinctions, a woman who so operates is a
benefactress (BEN′-Ə-fak′-trƏs). And, of course, the person receiving
the benefaction (ben-Ə-FAK′-shƏn), the recipient of money, help, etc.,
is a beneficiary (ben′-Ə-FISH′-Ər-ee or ben-Ə-FISH′-ee-air-ee). Benefit
and beneficial are other common words built on the combination of bene
and a form of facio, to do or make.</p>
<p>So let others be malevolent toward you—confuse them by being
benevolent (bƏ-NEV′-Ə-lƏnt)—wish them well. (Turn the other cheek? Why
not?) The noun? __________________</p>
<p>The adjective bonus, good, is found in English bonus, extra payment,
theoretically—but not necessarily—for some good act; in bonbon, a candy
(a “good-good,” using the French version of the Latin adjective); and in
bona fide (BŌ′-nƏ-FĪD′ or BŌ′-nƏ-FĪ′-dee), etymologically, “in good
faith,” hence valid, without pretense, deception, or fraudulent
intent—as a bona fide offer, a bona fide effort to negotiate
differences, etc. Fides is Latin for faith or trust, as in fidelity
(fƏ-DEL′-Ə-tee), faithfulness; Fido, a stereotypical name for a dog,
one’s faithful friend; infidel (IN′-fƏ-dƏl), one who does not have the
right faith or religion (depending on who is using the term), or one who
has no religion (Latin in-, not); and infidelity (in′-fƏ-DEL′-Ə-tee),
unfaithfulness, especially to the marriage vows.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>say, do, and wish</li>
</ol>
<p>Benediction and malediction derive from dico, dictus, to say, tell.
Dictate, dictator, dictation, dictatorial (dik′-tƏ-TAWR′-ee-Əl)—words
that signify telling others what to do (“Do as I say!”)—are built on
dico, as is predict, to tell beforehand, i.e., to say that something
will occur before it actually does (pre-, before, as in prescient).</p>
<p>The brand name Dictaphone combines dico with phone, sound;
contradict, to say against, or to make an opposite statement (“Don’t
contradict me!”; “That contradicts what I know”) combines dico with
contra-, against, opposite; and addiction, etymologically “a saying to
or toward,” or the compulsion to say “yes” to a habit, combines dico
with ad-, to, toward.</p>
<p>Facio, factus, to do or make (as in malefactor, benefactor), has, as
noted, variant spellings in English words: fec-, fic-, or, as a verb
ending, -fy.</p>
<p>Thus factory is a place where things are made (-ory, place where); a
fact is something done (i.e., something that occurs, or exists, or is,
therefore, true); fiction, something made up or invented; manufacture,
to make by hand (manus, hand, as in manuscript, manual), a word coined
before the invention of machinery; artificial, made by human art rather
than occurring in nature, as artificial flowers, etc.; and clarify,
simplify, liquefy, magnify (to make clear, simple, liquid, larger) among
hundreds of other -fy verbs.</p>
<p>Volo, to wish, to will, to be willing (as in malevolent, benevolent),
occurs in voluntary, involuntary, volunteer, words too familiar to need
definition, and each quite obviously expressing wish or willingness.
Less common, and from the same root, is volition (vō-LISH′-Ən), the act
or power of willing or wishing, as in “of her own volition,” i.e.,
voluntarily, or “against her volition.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>if you please!</li>
</ol>
<p>Placate is built on the root plac- which derives from two related
Latin verbs meaning, 1) to please, and 2) to appease, soothe, or
pacify.</p>
<p>If you succeed in placating an angry colleague, you turn that
person’s hostile attitude into one that is friendly or favorable. The
noun is placation (play-KAY′-shƏn), the adjective either placative
(PLAK′-Ə-tiv or PLAY′-kƏ-tiv) or placatory (PLAK′-Ə-taw-ree or
PLAY′-kƏ-taw-ree). A more placatory attitude to those you have offended
may help you regain their friendship; when husband and wife, or lovers,
quarrel, one of them finally makes a placative gesture if the war no
longer fulfills his or her neurotic needs—one of them eventually will
wake up some bright morning in a placatory mood.</p>
<p>But then, such is life, the other one may at that point be implacable
(im-PLAK′-Ə-bƏl or im-PLAY′-kƏ-bƏl)—im- is a respelling of in-, not,
before the letter p. One who can be soothed, whose hostility can be
changed to friendliness, is placable (PLAK′-Ə-bƏl or PLAY′-kƏ-bƏl).</p>
<p>Implacable has taken on the added meaning of unyielding to entreaty
or pity; hence, harsh, relentless, as “The governor was implacable in
his refusal to grant clemency.”</p>
<p>The noun form of implacable is implacability (im-plak′-Ə-BIL′-Ə-tee
or im-play′-kƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee). Can you write (and pronounce) the noun
derived from placable? __________________.</p>
<p>If you are placid (PLAS′-id), you are calm, easygoing, serene,
undisturbed—etymologically, you are pleased with things as they are.
Waters of a lake or sea, or the emotional atmosphere of a place, can
also be placid. The noun is placidity (plƏ-SID′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>If you are complacent (kƏm-PLAY-sƏnt), you are pleased with yourself
(com-, from con-, with, together); you may, in fact, such is one common
connotation of the word, be smug, too pleased with your position or
narrow accomplishments, too easily self-satisfied, and the hour of
reckoning may be closer than you realize. (Humans, as you know, are
delighted to be critical of the contentment of others.)</p>
<p>The noun is complacence (kƏm-PLAY′-sƏns) or complacency
(kƏm-PLAY′-sƏn-see).</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>how to give—and forgive</li>
</ol>
<p>To condone is to forgive, overlook, pardon, or be uncritical of (an
offense, or of an antisocial or illegal act). You yourself might or
might not indulge in such behavior or commit such an offense, but you
feel no urge to protest, or to demand censure or punishment for someone
else who does. You may condone cheating on one’s income tax, shoplifting
from a big, impersonal supermarket, or exceeding the speed limit, though
you personally observe the law with scrupulousness. (Not everyone,
however, is so charitable or forgiving.) The noun is condonation
(kon′-dō-NAY′-shƏn).</p>
<p>Condone is built on Latin dono, to give, the root found in donor, one
who gives; donate, to give; and donation, a gift.</p>

<p>TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Keeping in mind the roots animus in equanimity and magnus in
Magnavox or magnify, can you combine these two roots to form a noun
meaning, etymologically, largeness of mind? __________________. Can you
figure out the adjective form, ending in -ous, of the noun you have
constucted? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>If equilateral means equal-sided, can you construct an adjective
meaning two-sided? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Trans- is a prefix meaning across. Build a verb meaning to write
across (from one form or language to another): __________________. What
is the noun derived from this verb? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>What disease was so named on the erroneous assumption that it was
caused by “bad air?” __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Facio may appear in English words as fec-. Using the prefix con-,
together, can you form a noun sometimes used as a synonym for candy,
cake, or ice cream (etymologically, “something made together”)?

<p>THE THRILL OF RECOGNITION</p>
<p>You have been adding, over the past twenty-three sessions, hundreds
of words to your vocabulary; you have been learning hundreds of
prefixes, roots, and suffixes that make it possible for you to figure
out the meaning of many unfamiliar words you may come across in your
reading.</p>
<p>As time goes on and you notice more and more of the words you have
studied whenever you read, or whenever you listen to lectures, the
radio, or TV, the thrill of recognition plus the immediate comprehension
of complex ideas will provide a dividend of incalculable value.</p>
<p>You will hear these words in conversation, and you will begin to use
them yourself, unself-consciously, whenever something you want to say is
best expressed by one of the words that exactly verbalizes your
thinking. Another priceless dividend!</p>
<p>So keep on! You are involved in a dividend-paying activity that will
eventually make you intellectually rich.</p>

<p>1 Fulsome (FL′-sƏm) does not mean, despite its appearance, fully or
completely, but rather, offensive because of excessiveness or
insincerity, often in reference to compliments, praise, admiration, or
flattery.</p>
<p>Brief Intermission Five</p>
<p>HOW TO SPEAK NATURALLY</p>
<p>Consider this statement by Louis Bromfield, a noted author: “If I, as
a novelist, wrote dialogue for my characters which was meticulously
grammatical, the result would be the creation of a speech which rendered
the characters pompous and unreal.”</p>
<p>And this one by Jacques Barzun, former literary critic for Harper’s:
“Speech, after all, is in some measure an expression of character, and
flexibility in its use is a good way to tell your friends from the
robots.”</p>
<p>Consider also this puckish remark by the late Clarence Darrow: “Even
if you do learn to speak correct English, who are you going to speak it
to?”</p>
<p>These are typical reactions of professional people to the old
restrictions of formal English grammar. Do the actual teachers of
English feel the same way? Again, some typical statements:</p>
<p>“Experts and authorities do not make decisions and rules, by logic or
otherwise, about correctness,” said E. A. Cross, then Professor of
English at the Greeley, Colorado, College of Education. “All they can do
is observe the customs of cultivated and educated people and report
their findings.”</p>
<p>“Grammar is only an analysis after the facts, a post-mortem on
usage,” said Stephen Leacock in How To Write. “Usage comes first and
usage must rule.”</p>
<p>One way to discover current trends in usage is to poll a cross
section of people who use the language professionally, inquiring as to
their opinion of the acceptability, in everyday speech, of certain
specific and controversial expressions. A questionnaire I prepared
recently was answered by eighty-two such people—thirty-one authors,
seven book reviewers, thirty-three editors, and eleven professors of
English. The results, some of which will be detailed below, may possibly
prove startling to you if you have been conditioned to believe, as most
of us have, that correct English is rigid, unchangeable, and exclusively
dependent on grammatical rules.</p>

<p>RIGHT. There is a distinction, says formal grammar, between healthy
and healthful. A person can be healthy—I am still quoting the rule—if he
possesses good health. But climate must be healthful, since it is
conducive to health. This distinction is sometimes observed in writing
but rarely in everyday speech, as you have probably noticed. Even the
dictionaries have stopped splitting hairs—they permit you to say healthy
no matter which of the two meanings you intend.</p>
<p>“Healthy climate” was accepted as current educated usage by
twenty-six of the thirty-three editors who answered the questionnaire,
six of the seven book reviewers, nine of the eleven professors of
English, and twenty of the thirty-one authors. The earlier distinction,
in short, is rapidly becoming obsolete.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Her new novel is not as good as her first one.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. If you have studied formal grammar, you will recall that after
a negative verb the “proper” word is so, not as. Is this rule observed
by educated speakers? Hardly ever.</p>
<p>In reference to the sentence under discussion, author Thomas W.
Duncan remarked: “I always say—and write—as, much to the distress of my
publisher’s copyreader. But the fellow is a wretched purist.”</p>
<p>The tally on this use of as showed seventy-four for, only eight
against.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>We can’t hardly believe it.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. Of the eighty-two professional people who answered my
questionnaire, seventy-six rejected this sentence; it is evident that
can’t hardly is far from acceptable in educated speech. Preferred usage:
We can hardly believe it.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>This is her.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. This substitution of her where the rule requires she was
rejected by fifty-seven of my eighty-two respondents. Paradoxically
enough, although “It’s me” and “This is me” are fully established in
educated speech, “This is her” still seems to be condemned by the
majority of cultivated speakers. Nevertheless, the average person, I
imagine, may feel a bit uncomfortable saying “This is she”—it sounds
almost too sophisticated.</p>
<p>This is more than an academic problem. If the voice at the other end
of a telephone conversation makes the opening move with “I’d like to
speak to Jane Doe [your name, for argument’s sake],” you are,
unfortunately, on the horns of a very real dilemma. “This is she” may
sound prissy—“This is her” may give the impression that you’re
uneducated. Other choices are equally doubtful. “Talking!” is
suspiciously businesslike if the call comes to your home, and “I am Jane
Doe!” may make you feel like the opening line of a high school tableau.
The need for a decision arises several times in a busy day—and, I am
sorry to report, the English language is just deficient enough not to be
of much help. I wonder how it would be if you just grunted affably?</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Who are you waiting for?</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. Formal grammar not only requires whom but demands that the
word order be changed to: “For whom are you waiting?” (Just try talking
with such formality on everyday occasions and see how long you’ll keep
your friends.)</p>
<p>Who is the normal, popular form as the first word of a sentence, no
matter what the grammatical construction; and an opinion by Kyle
Crichton, a well-known magazine editor, is typical of the way many
educated people feel. Mr. Crichton says: “The most loathsome word (to me
at least) in the English language is whom. You can always tell a
half-educated buffoon by the care he takes in working the word in. When
he starts it, I know I am faced with a pompous illiterate who is not
going to have me long as company.”</p>
<p>The score for acceptance of the sentence as it stands (with who) was
sixty-six out of eighty-two. If, like most unpedantic speakers, you
prefer who to whom for informal occasions, or if you feel as strongly
about whom as Mr. Crichton does, you will be happy to hear that modern
trends in English are all on your side.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Please take care of whomever is waiting.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. Whomever is awkward and a little silly in this sentence and
brings to mind Franklin P. Adams’ famous remark on grammar: “ ‘Whom are
you?’ asked Cyril, for he had been to night school.” It is also contrary
to grammatical rule. People who are willing to be sufficiently
insufferable to use whomever in this construction have been tempted into
error by the adjacent word of. They believe that since they are
following a preposition with an objective pronoun they are speaking
impeccable grammar. In actuality, however, whomever is not the object of
the preposition of but the subject of the verb is waiting. Preferable
form: Please take care of whoever is waiting.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Whom would you like to be if you weren’t yourself?</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. Here is another and typical example of the damage which an
excessive reverence for whom can do to an innocent person’s speech.
Judged by grammatical rule, whom is incorrect in this sentence (the verb
to be requires who); judged by normal speech patterns, it is absurd.
This use of whom probably comes from an abortive attempt to sound
elegant.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>My wife has been robbed.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT—if something your wife owns was taken by means of thievery.
However, if your wife herself was kidnapped, or in some way talked into
leaving you, she was stolen, not robbed. To rob is to abscond with the
contents of something—to steal is to walk off with the thing itself.
Needless to say, both forms of activity are highly antisocial and
equally illegal.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Is this desert fattening?</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. The dessert that is fattening is spelled with two s’s. With
one s, it’s a desert, like the Sahara. Remember the two s’s in dessert
by thinking how much you’d like two portions, if only your waistline
permitted.</p>
