<p>• to hint?</p>
<p>• to make (something) easier to bear?</p>
<p>• to show sympathy?</p>

<hr />
<p>SESSION 42</p>
<p>WORDS are symbols of ideas—and we have been learning, discussing, and
working with words as they revolve around certain basic concepts.</p>
<p>Starting with an idea (personality types, doctors, occupations,
science, lying, actions, speech, insults, compliments, etc.), we have
explored the meanings and uses of ten basic words; then, working from
each word, we have wandered off toward any ideas and additional words
that a basic word might suggest, or toward any other words built on the
same Latin or Greek roots.</p>
<p>By this natural and logical method, you have been able to make
meaningful and lasting contact with fifty to a hundred or more words in
each chapter. And you have discovered, I think, that while five isolated
words may be difficult to learn in one day, fifty to a hundred or more
related words are easy to learn in a few sessions.</p>
<p>In this session we learn words that tell what’s going on, what’s
happening, what people do to each other or to themselves, or what others
do to them.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>complete exhaustion</li>
</ol>
<p>You have stayed up all night. And what were you doing? Playing poker,
a very pleasant way of whiling away time? No. Engaging in some creative
activity, like writing a short story, planning a political campaign,
discussing fascinating questions with friends? No.</p>
<p>The examples I have offered are exciting or stimulating—as
psychologists have discovered, it is not work or effort that causes
fatigue, but boredom, frustration, or a similar feeling.</p>
<p>You have stayed up all night with a very sick husband, wife, child,
or dear friend. And despite all your ministrations, the patient is
sinking. You can see how this long vigil contains all the elements of
frustration that contribute to mental, physical, and nervous
fatigue.</p>
<p>And so you are bushed—but completely bushed. Your exhaustion is
mental, it is physiological, it is emotional.</p>
<p>What verb expresses the effect of the night’s frustrations on
you?</p>
<p>o enervate</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>tongue-lashing</li>
</ol>
<p>You suddenly see the flashing red light as you glance in your
rear-view mirror. It’s the middle of the night, yet the police flasher
is clear as day—and then you hear the low growl of the siren. So you
pull over, knowing you were speeding along at 70 on the
55-mile-an-hour-limit freeway—after all, there was not another car in
sight on the deserted stretch of road you were traveling.</p>
<p>The cop is pleasant, courteous, smiling; merely asks for your
driver’s license and registration; even says “Please.”</p>
<p>Feeling guilty and stupid, you become irritated. So what do you
do?</p>
<p>You lash out at the officer with all the verbal vituperation welling
up in you from your self-anger. You scold him harshly for not spending
his time looking for violent criminals instead of harassing innocent
motorists; you call into question his honesty, his ambition, his
fairness, even his ancestry. To no avail, of course—you stare at the
traffic ticket morosely as the police cruiser pulls away.</p>
<p>What verb describes how you reacted?</p>
<p>o castigate</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>altruistic</li>
</ol>
<p>Phyllis is selfless and self-sacrificing. Her husband’s needs and
desires come first—even when they conflict with her own. Clothes for her
two daughters are her main concern—even if she has to wear a
seven-year-old coat and outmoded dresses so that Paula and Evelyn can
look smart and trim. At the dinner table, she heaps everyone’s
plate—while she herself often goes without. Phyllis will deny herself,
will scrimp and save—all to the end that she may offer her husband and
children the luxuries that her low self-esteem does not permit her to
give herself.</p>
<p>What verb expresses what Phyllis does?</p>
<p>o self-abnegate</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>repetition</li>
</ol>
<p>You have delivered a long, complicated lecture to your class, and
now, to make sure that they will remember the important points, you
restate the key ideas, the main thoughts. You offer, in short, a kind of
brief summary, step by step, omitting all extraneous details.</p>
<p>What verb best describes what you do?</p>
<p>o recapitulate</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>no joie de vivre</li>
</ol>
<p>Perhaps you wake up some gloomy Monday morning (why is it that Monday
is always the worst day of the week?) and begin to think of the waste of
the last five years. Intellectually, there has been no progress—you’ve
read scarcely half a dozen books, haven’t made one new, exciting friend,
haven’t had a startling or unusual thought. Economically, things are no
better—same old debts to meet, same old hundred dollars in the bank,
same old job, same old routine of the eight-to-five workdays, the tuna
fish or chicken salad sandwich for lunch, the same dreary ride home.
What a life! No change, nothing but routine, sameness, monotony—and for
what? (By now you’d better get up—this type of thinking never leads
anywhere, as you’ve long since learned.)</p>
<p>What verb describes how you think you live?</p>
<p>o vegetate</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>pretense</li>
</ol>
<p>Your neighbor, Mrs. Brown, pops in without invitation to tell you of
her latest troubles with (a) her therapist, (b) her hairdresser, (c) her
husband, (d) her children, and/or (e) her gynecologist.</p>
<p>Since Florence Brown is dull to the point of ennui, and anyway you
have a desk piled high with work you were planning to light into, you
find it difficult to concentrate on what she is saying. However, you do
not wish to offend her by sending her packing, or even by appearing to
be uninterested, so you pretend rapt attention, nodding wisely at what
you hope are the right places.</p>
<p>What verb describes this feigning of interest?</p>
<p>o simulate</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>slight hint, no more</li>
</ol>
<p>You are an author and are discussing with your editor the possible
avenues of publicity and advertising for your new book. At one point in
the conversation the editor makes several statements which might—or
might not—be construed to mean that the company is going to promote the
book heavily. For example, “If we put some real money behind this, we
might sell a few copies,” or “I wonder if it would be a good idea to get
you on a few talk shows …” No unequivocal commitments, no clear-cut
promises, only the slight and oblique mention of possibilities.</p>
<p>What verb expresses what the editor is doing?</p>
<p>o intimate</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>helpful</li>
</ol>
<p>Aspirin doesn’t cure any diseases. Yet this popular and inexpensive
drug is universally used to lighten and relieve various unpleasant
symptoms of disease: aches and pains, fever, inflammations, etc.</p>
<p>What verb expresses the action of aspirin?</p>
<p>o alleviate</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>when the bell tolls</li>
</ol>
<p>John Donne’s lines (made famous by Ernest Hemingway):</p>
<p>No man is an Iland, intire of it selfe; every man is a peece of the
Continent, a part of the maine; if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea,
Europe is the lesse, as well as if a Promontorie were, as well as if a
Mannor of thy friends or of thine owne were; any mans death diminishes
me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know
for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.</p>
<p>are truer than you may think; any person who views another’s pain
with complete detachment or indifference is shutting off important
feelings.</p>
<p>When people have suffered a bereavement (as through death); when they
have been wounded by life or by friends; then is the time they most need
to feel that they are not alone, that you share their misery with them
even if you cannot directly alleviate their sorrow. Your sympathy and
compassion are, of course, alleviation enough.</p>
<p>What verb signifies this vicarious sharing of sorrow with someone who
directly suffers?</p>
<p>o commiserate</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>when two men propose</li>
</ol>
<p>Should you marry John or George? (You’re strongly and equally
attracted to both.) John is handsome, virile, tender; George is stable,
reliable, dependable, always there when you need him. George loves you
deeply; John is more exciting. You decide on John, naturally.</p>
<p>But wait—marrying John would mean giving up George, and with George
you always know where you stand; he’s like the Rock of Gibraltar (and
sometimes almost as dull). So you change your mind—it’s George, on more
mature reflection.</p>
<p>But how happy can you be with a husband who is not exciting? Maybe
John would be best after all.…</p>
<p>The pendulum swings back and forth—you cannot make up your mind and
stick to it. (You fail to realize that your indecision proves that you
don’t want to marry either one, or perhaps don’t want to give either one
up, or possibly don’t even want to get married.) First it’s John, then
it’s George, then back to John, then George again. Which is it, which is
it?</p>
<p>What verb describes your pendulum-like indecision?</p>
<p>o vacillate</p>

<p>SESSION 43</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>more than fatigue</li>
</ol>
<p>When you are enervated, you feel as if your nerves have been ripped
out—or so the etymology of the word indicates.</p>
<p>Enervate is derived from e- (ex-), out, and Latin nervus, nerve.
Enervation (en′-Ər-VAY′-shƏn) is not just fatigue, but complete
devitalization—physical, emotional, mental—as if every ounce of the life
force has been sapped out, as if the last particle of energy has been
drained away.</p>
<p>Despite its similar appearance to the word energy, enervation is
almost a direct antonym. Energy is derived from the Greek prefix en-,
in, plus the root ergon, work; erg is the term used in physics for a
unit of work or energy. Synergism (SIN′-Ər-jiz-Əm)—the prefix syn-,
together or with, plus ergon—is the process by which two or more
substances or drugs, by working together, produce a greater effect in
combination than the sum total of their individual effects.</p>
<p>Alcohol, for example, is a depressant. So are barbiturates and other
soporifics. Alcohol and barbiturates work synergistically
(sin′-Ər-JIS′-tik′-lee)—the effect of each is increased by the other if
the two are taken together.</p>
<p>So if you’re drinking, don’t take a sleeping pill—or if you must take
a pill for your insomnia, don’t drink—the combination, if not lethal,
will do more to you than you may want done!</p>
<p>Synergy (SIN′-Ər-jee), by the way, is an alternate form of
synergism.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>verbal punishment</li>
</ol>
<p>Castigate is derived from a Latin verb meaning to punish; in
present-day usage, the verb generally refers to verbal punishment,
usually harsh and severe. It is somewhat synonymous with scold,
criticize, rebuke, censure, reprimand, or berate, but much stronger than
any of these—rail at, rant at, slash at, lash out at, or tongue-lash is
a much closer synonym. When candidates for office castigate their
opponents, they do not mince words.</p>
<p>Can you construct the noun form of castigate? __________________.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>saying “No!” to oneself</li>
</ol>
<p>Abnegate is derived from Latin ab-, away (as in absent), plus nego,
to deny—self-abnegation (ab′-nƏ-GAY′-shƏn), then, is self-denial. Nego
itself is a contraction of Latin neg-, not, no, and aio, I say; to be
self-abnegating is to say “No!” to what you want, as if some inner
censor were at work whispering, “No, you can’t have that, you can’t do
that, you don’t deserve that, you’re not good enough for that.…”</p>
<p>To negate (nƏ-GAYT′) is to deny the truth or existence of, as in “The
atheist negates God”; or, by extension, to destroy by working against,
as in, “His indulgence in expensive hobbies negates all his wife’s
attempts to keep the family solvent.” Can you write the noun form of the
verb negate? __________________.</p>
<p>Negative and negativity obviously spring from the same source as
negate.</p>

<li>heads and headings</li>
</ol>
<p>Latin caput, capitis means head. The captain is the head of any
group; the capital is the “head city” of a state or nation; and to
decapitate (dee-KAP′-Ə-tayt′) is to chop off someone’s head, a popular
activity during the French Revolution after the guillotine was invented.
Write the noun form of decapitate: __________________.</p>
<p>Latin capitulum is a little head, or, by extension, the heading, or
title, of a chapter. So when you recapitulate, you go through the
chapter headings again (re-), etymologically speaking, or you summarize
or review the main points.</p>
<p>Remembering how the noun and adjective forms are derived from adulate
(Chapter 9), can you write the required forms of recapitulate?</p>
<p>NOUN: __________________.</p>
<p>ADJECTIVE: __________________.</p>
<p>When you capitulate (kƏ-PICH′-Ə-layt′), etymologically you arrange in
headings, or, as the meaning of the verb naturally evolved, you arrange
conditions of surrender, as when an army capitulates to the enemy forces
under prearranged conditions; or, by further natural extension, you stop
resisting and give up, as in, “He realized there was no longer any point
in resisting her advances, so he reluctantly capitulated.” Can you write
the noun form of capitulate? __________________.</p>

<li>mere vegetables</li>
</ol>
<p>Vegetable is from Latin vegeto, to live and grow, which is what
vegetables do—but that’s all they do, so to vegetate, is, by
implication, to do no more than stay alive, stuck in a rut, leading an
inactive, unstimulating, emotionally and intellectually stagnant
existence. Vegetation (vej′-Ə-TAY′-shƏn) is any dull, passive, stagnant
existence; also any plant life, as the thick vegetation of a jungle.</p>

<p>SESSION 44</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>not the real McCoy</li>
</ol>
<p>Simulate is from Latin simulo, to copy; and simulo itself derives
from the Latin adjectives similis, like or similar.</p>
<p>Simulation (sim′-yƏ-LAY′-shƏn), then, is copying the real thing,
pretending to be the genuine article by taking on a similar appearance.
The simulation of joy is quite a feat when you really feel
depressed.</p>
<p>Genuine pearls grow inside oysters; simulated pearls are synthetic,
but look like the ones from oysters. (Rub a pearl against your teeth to
tell the difference—the natural pearl feels gritty.) So the frequent
advertisement of an inexpensive necklace made of “genuine simulated
pearls” can fool you if you don’t know the word—you’re being offered a
genuine fake.</p>
<p>Dissimulation (dƏ-sim′-yƏ-LAY′-shƏn) is something else! When you
dissimulate (dƏ-SIM′-yƏ-layt′), you hide your true feelings by making a
pretense of opposite feelings. (Then again, maybe it’s not something
completely else!)</p>
<p>Sycophants are great dissimulators—they may feel contempt, but show
admiration; they may feel negative, but express absolutely positive
agreement.</p>
<p>A close synonym of dissimulate is dissemble (dƏ-SEM′-bƏl), which also
is to hide true feelings by pretending the opposite; or, additionally,
to conceal facts, or one’s true intentions, by deception; or, still
further additionally, to pretend ignorance of facts you’d rather not
admit, when, indeed, you’re fully aware of them.</p>
<p>The noun is dissemblance (dƏ-SEM′-blƏns).</p>
<p>In dissimulate and dissemble, the negative prefix dis- acts largely
to make both words pejorative.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>hints and helps</li>
</ol>
<p>The verb intimate is from Latin intimus, innermost, the same root
from which the adjective intimate (IN′-tƏ-mƏt) and its noun intimacy
(IN′-tƏ-mƏ-see) are derived; but the relationship is only in etymology,
not in meaning. An intimation (in′-tƏ-MAY′-shƏn) contains a significance
buried deep in the innermost core, only a hint showing. As you grow
older, you begin to have intimations that you are mortal; when someone
aims a .45 at you, or when a truck comes roaring down at you as you
drive absent-mindedly against a red light through an intersection, you
are suddenly very sure that you are mortal.</p>
<p>Alleviate is a combination of Latin levis, light (not heavy), the
prefix ad-, to, and the verb suffix. (Ad- changes to al- before a root
starting with l-.)</p>
<p>If something alleviates your pain, it makes your pain lighter for
you; if I alleviate your sadness, I make it lighter to bear; and if you
need some alleviation (Ə-lee′-vee-AY′-shƏn) of your problems, you need
them made lighter and less burdensome. To alleviate is to relieve only
temporarily, not to cure or do away with. (Relieve is also from levis,
plus re-, again—to make light or easy again.) The adjective form of
alleviate is alleviative (Ə-LEE′-vee-ay′-tiv)—aspirin is an alleviative
drug.</p>
<p>Anything light will rise—so from the prefix e- (ex-), out, plus
levis, we can construct the verb elevate, etymologically, to raise out,
or, actually, raise up, as to elevate one’s spirits, raise them up, make
them lighter; or elevate someone to a higher position, which is what an
elevator does.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a performance of magic in which a person or an
object apparently rises in the air as if floating? That’s levitation
(lev′-Ə-TAY′-shƏn)—rising through no visible means. (I’ve watched it a
dozen times and never could figure it out!) The verb, to so rise, is
levitate (LEV′-Ə-tayt′).</p>
<p>And how about levity (LEV′-Ə-tee)? That’s lightness too, but of a
different sort—lightness in the sense of frivolity, flippancy, joking,
or lack of seriousness, especially when solemnity, dignity, or formality
is required or more appropriate, as in “tones of levity,” or as in,
“Levity is out of place at a funeral, in a house of worship, at the
swearing-in ceremonies of a President or Supreme Court Justice,” or as
in, “Okay, enough levity—now let’s get down to business!”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>sharing someone’s misery</li>
</ol>
<p>Latin miser, wretched, the prefix con- (which, as you know, becomes
com- before a root beginning with m-), together or with, and the verb
suffix -ate are the building blocks from which commiserate is
constructed. “I commiserate with you,” then, means, “I am wretched
together with you—I share your misery.” The noun form?
__________________.</p>
<p>Miser, miserly, miserable, misery all come from the same root.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>swing and sway</li>
</ol>
<p>Vacillate—note the single c, double l—derives from Latin vacillo, to
swing back and forth. The noun form? __________________.</p>
<p>People who swing back and forth in indecision, who are irresolute,
who can, unfortunately, see both, or even three or four, sides of every
question, and so have difficulty making up their minds, are vacillatory
(VAS′-Ə-lƏ-tawr′-ee). They are also, usually, ambivalent
(am-BIV′-Ə-lƏnt)—they have conflicting and simultaneous emotions about
the same person or thing; or they want to go but they also want to stay;
or they love something, but they hate it too. The noun is ambivalence
(am-BIV′-Ə-lƏns)—from ambi both. (Remember ambivert and ambidextrous
from Chapter 3?)</p>
<p>Ambivalence has best been defined (perhaps by Henny Youngman—if he
didn’t say it first, he should have) as watching your mother-in-law
drive over a cliff in your new Cadillac.</p>
<p>To vacillate is to swing mentally or emotionally. To sway back and
forth physically is oscillate—again note the double l—(OS′-Ə-layt′),
from Latin oscillum, a swing. A pendulum oscillates, the arm of a
metronome oscillates, and people who’ve had much too much to drink
oscillate when they try to walk. The noun? __________________.</p>

<p>TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST</p>
<p>We have previously met the Greek prefix syn-, together or with, in
synonym (“names together”) and sympathy (“feeling with”), and again in
this chapter in synergism (“working together”).</p>
<p>Syn- is a most useful prefix to know. Like Latin con-, (together or
with) and ad- (to, toward), the final letter changes depending on the
first letter of the root to which it is attached. Syn- becomes sym-
before b, m, and p.</p>
<p>Can you construct some words using syn-, or sym-?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Etymologically, Jews are “led together” in a house of worship
(agogos, leading). Can you construct the word for this temple or place
of worship? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>There is a process by which dissimilar organisms live together
(bios, life) in close association, each in some way helping, and getting
help from, the other (like the shark and the pilot fish). What word,
ending in -sis, designates such a process? __________________.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What would the adjective form be? __________________.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Using Greek phone, sound, write the word that etymologically
refers to a musical composition in which the sounds of all instruments
are in harmony together __________________. Using the suffix -ic, write
the adjective form of this word: __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Combine sym- with metron, measurement, to construct a word
designating similarity of shape on both sides (i.e., “measurement
together”): __________________.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Write the adjective form of this word: __________________.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Syn- plus dromos, a running, are the building blocks of a medical
word designating a group of symptoms that occur (i.e., run) together in
certain diseases. Can you figure out the word?
__________________</p></li>
<li><p>The same dromos, a running, combines with Greek hippos, horse, to
form a word referring to a place in ancient Greece in which horse and
chariot races were run. The word? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Hippos, horse, plus Greek potamos, river, combine to form a word
designating one of the three pachyderms we discussed in an earlier
chapter. The word? __________________.</p></li>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18.)</p>
<p>PICKING YOUR FRIENDS’ BRAINS</p>
<p>You can build your vocabulary, I have said, by increasing your
familiarity with new ideas and by becoming alert to the new words you
meet in your reading of magazines and books.</p>
<p>There is still another productive method, one that will be
particularly applicable in view of all the new words you are learning
from your study of these pages.</p>
<p>That method is picking your friends’ brains.</p>
<p>Intelligent people are interested in words because words are symbols
of ideas, and the person with an alert mind is always interested in
ideas.</p>
<p>You may be amazed, if you have never tried it, to find that you can
stir up an animated discussion by asking, in a social group that you
attend, “What does __________________ mean?” (Use any word that
particularly fascinates you.) Someone in the group is likely to know,
and almost everyone will be willing to make a guess. From that point on,
others in the group will ask questions about their own favorite words
(most people do have favorites), or about words that they themselves
have in some manner recently learned. As the discussion continues along
these lines, you will be introduced to new words yourself, and if your
friends have fairly good vocabularies you may strike a rich vein of pay
dirt and come away with a large number of words to add to your
vocabulary.</p>
<p>This method of picking your friends’ brains is particularly fruitful
because you will be learning not from a page of print (as in this book
or as in your other reading) but from real live persons—the same sources
that children use to increase their vocabularies at such prodigious
rates. No learning is quite as effective as the learning that comes from
other people—no information in print can ever be as vivid as information
that comes from another human being. And so the words you pick up from
your friends will have an amazingly strong appeal, will make a lasting
impression on your mind.</p>
<p>Needless to say, your own rich vocabulary, now that you have come
this far in the book, will make it possible for you to contribute to
your friends’ vocabulary as much as, if not more than, you take away—but
since giving to others is one of the greatest sources of a feeling of
self-worth, you can hardly complain about this extra dividend.</p>

<p>Brief Intermission Nine</p>
<p>TAKE THIS SPELLING TEST</p>
<p>Even in the most painstakingly edited of magazines, a silly little
misspelling of a perfectly common word will occasionally appear. How the
error eluded the collective and watchful eyes of the editor, the
associate editor, the assistant editor, the typesetter, and the
proofreader, no one will ever know—for practically every reader of the
magazine spots it at once and writes an indignant letter, beginning:
“Didn’t you ever go to school …?”</p>
<p>Even if you went to school, you’re going to have plenty of trouble
spotting the one misspelled word in each group below. And not one of
these words will be a demon like sphygmomanometer (a device for
measuring blood pressure) or piccalilli (a highly seasoned relish),
which no one would ever dare spell without first checking with a
dictionary. On the contrary, every word will be of the common or garden
variety that you might use every day in your social or business
correspondence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you’re letting yourself in for ten minutes of real
trouble, for you will be working with fifty particularly difficult
spelling words. So put on your thinking cap before you begin.</p>
<p>A half-dozen high school teachers who took this test were able to
make an average score of only five proper choices. Can you do better?
Six or seven right is very good, eight or nine right is excellent, and
100 per cent success marks you as an absolute expert in English
spelling.</p>
<p>Check the only misspelled word in each group.</p>
<p>A: 1–surprise, 2–disappear, 3–innoculate, 4–description,
5–recommend</p>
<p>B: 1–privilege, 2–separate, 3–incidentally, 4–dissipate,
5–occurence</p>
<p>C: 1–analize, 2–argument, 3–assistant, 4–comparative, 5–truly</p>
<p>D: 1–grammar, 2–drunkeness, 4–parallel, 4–sacrilegious,
5–conscience</p>
<p>E: 1–precede, 2–exceed, 3–accede, 4–procede, 5–concede</p>
<p>F: 1–pronunciation, 2–noticable, 3–desirable, 4–holiday, 5–anoint</p>
<p>G: 1–wierd, 2–seize, 3–achieve, 4–receive, 5–leisure</p>
<p>H: 1–superintendent, 2–persistent, 3–resistant, 4–insistent,
5–perseverence</p>
<p>I: 1–accessible, 2–permissible, 3–inimitable, 4–irresistable,
5–irritable</p>
<p>J: 1–pursue, 2–pastime, 3–kidnapped, 4–rhythmical, 5–exhillarate</p>
<hr />
<p>KEY: A–3 (inoculate), B–5 (occurrence), C–1 (analyze), D–2
(drunkenness), E–4 (proceed), F–2 (noticeable), G–1 (weird), H–5
(perseverance), I–4 (irresistible), J–5 (exhilarate)</p>
