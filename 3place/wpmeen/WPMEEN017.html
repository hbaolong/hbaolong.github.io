<hr />
<p>SESSION 32</p>
<p>Words are the symbols of emotions, as well as ideas. You can show
your feeling by the tone you use (“You’re silly” can be an insult, an
accusation, or an endearment, depending on how you say it) or by the
words you choose (you can label a quality either “childish” or
“childlike,” depending on whether you admire it or condemn it—it’s the
same quality, no matter what you call it).</p>
<p>In Chapter 11 we discussed ten basic words that you might use to show
your disapproval. In this chapter we discuss ten adjectives that
indicate wholehearted approval.</p>
<p>Consider the interesting types of people described in the following
paragraphs, then note how accurately the adjective applies to each
type.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>put the kettle on, Polly</li>
</ol>
<p>They are friendly, happy, extroverted, and gregarious—the sort of
people who will invite you out for a drink, who like to transact
business around the lunch table, who put the coffee to perking as soon
as company drops in. They’re sociable, genial, cordial, affable—and they
like parties and all the eating and drinking that goes with them.</p>
<p>The adjective is: convivial</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>you can’t tire them</li>
</ol>
<p>Arnold Bennett once pointed out that we all have the same amount of
time—twenty-four hours a day. Strictly speaking, that’s as inconclusive
an observation as Bennett ever made. It’s not time that counts, but
energy—and of that wonderful quality we all have very different amounts,
from the persons who wake up tired, no matter how much sleep they’ve
had, to lucky, well-adjusted mortals who hardly ever need to sleep.</p>
<p>Energy comes from a healthy body, of course; it also comes from a
psychological balance, a lack of conflicts and insecurities.</p>
<p>Some people apparently have boundless, illimitable energy—they’re on
the go from morning to night, and often far into the night, working
hard, playing hard, never tiring, never “pooped” or “bushed”—and getting
twice as much done as any three other human beings.</p>
<p>The adjective is: indefatigable</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>no tricks, no secrets</li>
</ol>
<p>They are pleasingly frank, utterly lacking in pretense or
artificiality, in fact quite unable to hide their feelings or
thoughts—and so honest and aboveboard that they can scarcely conceive of
trickery, chicanery, or dissimulation in anyone. There is, then, about
them the simple naturalness and unsophistication of a child.</p>
<p>The adjective is: ingenuous</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>sharp as a razor</li>
</ol>
<p>They have minds like steel traps; their insight into problems that
would confuse or mystify people of less keenness or discernment is just
short of amazing.</p>
<p>The adjective is: perspicacious</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>no placating necessary</li>
</ol>
<p>They are most generous about forgiving a slight, an insult, an
injury. Never do they harbor resentment, store up petty grudges, or
waste energy or thought on means of revenge or retaliation. How could
they? They’re much too big-hearted.</p>
<p>The adjective is: magnanimous</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>one-person orchestras</li>
</ol>
<p>The range of their aptitudes is truly formidable. If they are
writers, they have professional facility in poetry, fiction, biography,
criticism, essays—you just mention it and they’ve done it, and very
competently. If they are musicians, they can play the oboe, the bassoon,
the French horn, the bass viol, the piano, the celesta, the xylophone,
even the clavichord if you can dig one up. If they are artists, they use
oils, water colors, gouache, charcoal, pen and ink—they can do anything!
Or maybe the range of their abilities cuts across all fields, as in the
case of Michelangelo, who was an expert sculptor, painter, poet,
architect, and inventor. In case you’re thinking “Jack of all trades…,”
you’re wrong—they’re masters of all trades.</p>
<p>The adjective is: versatile</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>no grumbling</li>
</ol>
<p>They bear their troubles bravely, never ask for sympathy, never yield
to sorrow, never wince at pain. It sounds almost superhuman, but it’s
true.</p>
<p>The adjective is: stoical</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>no fear</li>
</ol>
<p>There is not, as the hackneyed phrase has it, a cowardly bone in
their bodies. They are strangers to fear, they’re audacious, dauntless,
contemptuous of danger and hardship.</p>
<p>The adjective is: intrepid</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>no dullness</li>
</ol>
<p>They are witty, clever, delightful; and naturally, also, they are
brilliant and entertaining conversationalists.</p>
<p>The adjective is: scintillating</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>city slickers</li>
</ol>
<p>They are cultivated, poised, tactful, socially so experienced,
sophisticated, and courteous that they’re at home in any group, at ease
under all circumstances of social intercourse. You cannot help admiring
(perhaps envying) their smoothness and self-assurance, their tact and
congeniality.</p>
<p>The adjective is: urbane</p>

<p>SESSION 33</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>eat, drink, and be merry</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin verb vivo, to live, and the noun vita, life, are the source
of a number of important English words.</p>
<p>Convivo is the Latin verb to live together; from this, in Latin, was
formed the noun convivium (don’t get impatient; we’ll be back to English
directly), which meant a feast or banquet; and from convivium we get our
English word convivial, an adjective that describes the kind of person
who likes to attend feasts and banquets, enjoying (and supplying) the
jovial good fellowship characteristic of such gatherings.</p>
<p>Using the suffix -ity can you write the noun form of the adjective
convivial? __________________. (Can you pronounce it?)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>living it up</li>
</ol>
<p>Among many others, the following English words derive from Latin
vivo, to live:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>vivacious (vī-VAY′-shƏs)—full of the joy of living; animated;
peppy—a vivacious personality. Noun: vivacity (vī-VAS′-Ə-tee). You can,
as you know, also add -ness to any adjective to form a noun. Write the
alternate noun form of vivacious: __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>vivid—possessing the freshness of life; strong; sharp—a vivid
imagination; a vivid color. Add -ness to form the noun:
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>revive (rƏ-VĪV′)—bring back to life. In the 1960s, men’s fashions
of the twenties were revived. Noun: revival (rƏ-VĪ′-vƏl).</p></li>
<li><p>vivisection (viv′-Ə-SEK′-shƏn)—operating on a live animal. Sect-
is from a Latin verb meaning to cut. Vivisection is the process of
experimenting on live animals to discover causes and cures of disease.
Antivivisectionists object to the procedure, though many of our most
important medical discoveries were made through vivisection.</p></li>
<li><p>Viviparous (vī-VIP′-Ər-Əs)—producing live babies. Human beings
and most other mammals are viviparous. Viviparous is contrasted to
oviparous (ō-VIP′-Ər-Əs), producing young from eggs. Most fish, fowl,
and other lower forms of life are oviparous.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The combining root in both these adjectives is Latin pareo, to give
birth (parent comes from the same root). In oviparous, the first two
syllables derive from Latin ovum, egg.</p>
<p>Ovum, egg, is the source of oval and ovoid, egg-shaped; ovulate
(Ō′-vyƏ-layt′), to release an egg from the ovary: ovum (Ō-vƏm), the
female germ cell which, when fertilized by a sperm, develops into an
embryo, then into a fetus (FEE′-tƏs), and finally, in about 280 days in
the case of humans, is born as an infant.</p>
<p>The adjective form of ovary is ovarian (ō-VAIR′-ee-Ən); of fetus,
fetal (FEE′-tƏl). Can you write the noun form of the verb ovulate?
__________________.</p>
<p>Love, you may or may not be surprised to hear, also comes from
ovum.</p>
<p>No, not the kind of love you’re thinking of. Latin ovum became oeuf
in French, or with “the” preceding the noun (the egg), Voeuf, pronounced
something like LF. Zero (picture it for a moment) is shaped like an egg
(0), so if your score in tennis is fifteen, and your opponent’s is zero,
you shout triumphantly, “Fifteen love! Let’s go!”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>more about life</li>
</ol>
<p>Latin vita, life, is the origin of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>vital (VĪ′-tƏl)—essential to life; of crucial importance—a vital
matter; also full of life, strength, vigor, etc. Add the suffix -ity to
form the noun: __________________. Add a verb suffix to construct the
verb: __________________ (meaning: to give life to). Finally, write the
noun derived from the verb you have constructed:
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Revitalize (ree-VĪ′-tƏ-līz′) is constructed from the prefix re-,
again, back, the root vita, and the verb suffix. Meaning?
__________________. Can you write the noun formed from this verb?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>The prefix de- has a number of meanings, one of which is
essentially negative, as in defrost, decompose, declassify, etc. Using
this prefix, can you write a verb meaning to rob of life, to take life
from? __________________. Now write the noun form of this verb:
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Vitamin—one of the many nutritional elements on which life is
dependent. Good eyesight requires vitamin A (found, for example, in
carrots); strong bones need vitamin D (found in sunlight and cod-liver
oil); etc.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Vitalize, revitalize, and devitalize are used figuratively—for
example, a program or plan is vitalized, revitalized, or devitalized,
according to how it’s handled.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>French life</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, instead of getting our English words directly from Latin,
we work through one of the Latin-derived or Romance languages. (As you
will recall, the Romance languages—French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese,
and Romanian—are so called because they were originally dialects of the
old Roman tongue. English, by the way, is not a Romance language, but a
Teutonic one. Our tongue is a development of a German dialect imposed on
the natives of Britain by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes of early English
history. Though we have taken over into English more than 50 per cent of
the Latin vocabulary and almost 30 per cent of the classical Greek
vocabulary as roots and prefixes, our basic language is nevertheless
German).</p>
<p>The French, using the same Latin root vivo, to live, formed two
expressive phrases much used in English. French pronunciation is, of
course, tricky, and if you are not at least superficially acquainted
with that language, your pronunciation may sound a bit awkward to the
sophisticated ear—but try it anyway. These phrases are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>joie de vivre—pronounced something like zhwahd′-VEEV′ (zh is
identical in sound to the s of pleasure).</li>
</ol>
<p>Literally joy of living, this phrase describes an immense delight in
being alive, an effervescent keenness for all the daily activities that
human beings indulge in. People who possess joie de vivre are never
moody, depressed, bored, or apathetic—on the contrary, they are full of
sparkle, eager to engage in all group activities, and, most important,
always seem to be having a good time, no matter what they are doing.
Joie de vivre is precisely the opposite of ennui (this is also a word of
French origin, but is easy to pronounce: AHN′-wee), which is a feeling
of boredom, discontent, or weariness resulting sometimes from having a
jaded, oversophisticated appetite, sometimes from just finding all of
life tedious and unappetizing, and sometimes implying in addition
physical lassitude and general inactivity. Young children and simple
people rarely experience ennui—to them life is always exciting, always
new.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>bon vivant, pronounced something like BŌNG′-vee-VAHNG′—the -NG a
muted nasal sound similar to the -ng in sing.</li>
</ol>
<p>A bon vivant is a person who lives luxuriously, especially in respect
to rich food, good liquor, expensive theater parties, operas, and other
accouterments of upper-class life. Bon vivant means, literally, a good
liver; actually, a high liver, one who lives a luxurious life. When you
think of a bon vivant (usually, language being sexist, a male), you get
the picture of someone attired in top hat, “soup and fish” or tuxedo,
raising his cane to call a taxi while a beautiful, evening-gowned and
sophisticated-looking woman, sparkling in diamonds and furs, waits at
his side. They’re going to a champagne and partridge supper at an
outrageously expensive restaurant, etc.—fill in your own details of the
high life.</p>
<p>The bon vivant is of course a convivial person—and also likely to be
a gourmet (gr-MAY′), another word from French.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>food and how to enjoy it</li>
</ol>
<p>The gourmand (GR′-mƏnd) enjoys food with a sensual pleasure. To
gourmands the high spots of the day are the times for breakfast, lunch,
dinner, and midnight supper; in short, they like to eat, but the eating
must be good. The verb form, gormandize (GAWR′-mƏn-dīz′), however, has
suffered a degeneration in meaning—it signifies to stuff oneself like a
pig.</p>
<p>A gourmand is significantly different from a gourmet, who has also a
keen interest in food and liquor, but is much more fastidious, is more
of a connoisseur, has a most discerning palate for delicate tastes,
flavors, and differences; goes in for rare delicacies (like
hummingbirds’ tongues and other such absurdities); and approaches the
whole business from a scientific, as well as a sensual, viewpoint.
Gourmet is always a complimentary term, gourmand somewhat less so.</p>
<p>The person who eats voraciously, with no discernment whatever, but
merely for the purpose of stuffing himself (“I know I haven’t had enough
to eat till I feel sick”), is called a glutton (GLUT′-Ən)—obviously a
highly derogatory term. The verb gluttonize is stronger than gormandize;
the adjective gluttonous (GLUT′-Ə-nƏs) is about the strongest epithet
you can apply to someone whose voracious eating habits you find
repulsive. Someone who has a voracious, insatiable appetite for money,
sex, punishment, etc. is also called a glutton.</p>

<p>SESSION 34</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>no fatigue</li>
</ol>
<p>Indefatigable is a derived form of fatigue—in- is a negative prefix,
the suffix -able means able to be; hence, literally, indefatigable means
unable to be fatigued. The noun is indefatigability
(in′-do-fat′-Ə-gƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>how simple can one be?</li>
</ol>
<p>Ingenuous is a complimentary term, though its synonyms naïve,
gullible, and credulous are faintly derogatory.</p>
<p>To call people ingenuous implies that they are frank, open,
artless—in other words, not likely to try to put anything over on you,
nor apt to hide feelings or thoughts that more sophisticated persons
would consider it wise, tactful, or expedient to conceal.</p>
<p>Ingenuous should not be confused with ingenious (in-JEEN′-yƏs)—note
the slight difference in spelling—which on the contrary means shrewd,
clever, inventive.</p>
<p>The noun form of ingenuous is ingenuousness; of ingenious, ingenuity
(in′-jƏ-N′-Ə-tee) or ingeniousness.</p>
<p>To call people naïve (nah-EEV′) is to imply that they have not
learned the ways of the world, and are therefore idealistic and trusting
beyond the point of safety; such idealism and trust have probably come
from ignorance or inexperience. The noun is naïveté (nah-eev-TAY′).</p>
<p>Credulous (KREJ′-Ə-lƏs) implies a willingness to believe almost
anything, no matter how fantastic. Credulity (krƏ-J′-lƏ-tee), like
naïveté, usually results, again, from ignorance or inexperience, or
perhaps from an inability to believe that human beings are capable of
lying.</p>
<p>Gullible (GUL′-Ə-bƏl) means easily tricked, easily fooled, easily
imposed on. It is a stronger word than credulous and is more derogatory.
Gullibility (gul′-Ə-BIL′-Ə-tee) results more from stupidity than from
ignorance or inexperience.</p>
<p>These four synonyms, ingenuous, naïve, credulous, and gullible, are
fairly close, but they contain areas of distinction worth remembering.
Let’s review them:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>ingenuous—frank, not given to concealment</p></li>
<li><p>naïve—inexperienced, unsophisticated, trusting</p></li>
<li><p>credulous—willing to believe; not suspicious or
skeptical</p></li>
<li><p>gullible—easily tricked</p></li>
<li><p>belief and disbelief</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Credulous comes from Latin credo, to believe, the same root found in
credit (if people believe in your honesty, they will extend credit to
you; they will credit what you say). -Ous is an adjective suffix that
usually signifies full of. So, strictly, credulous means full of
believingness.</p>
<p>Do not confuse credulous with credible. (KRED′-Ə-bƏl). In the latter
word we see combined the root credo, believe, with -ible, a suffix
meaning can be. Something credible can be believed.</p>
<p>Let’s chart some differences:</p>
<p>Credulous listeners—those who fully believe what they hear</p>
<p>A credible story—one that can be believed</p>
<p>An incredulous (in-KREJ′-Ə-lƏs) attitude—an attitude of skepticism,
of non-belief</p>
<p>An incredible (in-KRED′-Ə-bƏl) story—one that cannot be believed</p>
<p>Incredible characters—persons who are so unique that you can scarcely
believe they exist.</p>
<p>Nouns are formed as follows:</p>
<p>credulous—credulity (krƏ-J′-lƏ-tee)</p>
<p>incredulous—incredulity (in-krƏ-J′-lƏ-tee)</p>
<p>credible—credibility (kred′-Ə-BIL′-Ə-tee)</p>
<p>incredible—incredibility (in-kred′-Ə-BIL′-Ə-tee)</p>
<p>To check your understanding of these distinctions, try the next
test.</p>
<p>Can you use these words correctly?</p>
<p>Use credulous, credible, or corresponding negative or noun forms in
the following sentences:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>She listened __________________ly to her husband’s confession of
his frequent infidelity, for she had always considered him a paragon of

<li><p>He told his audience an __________________ and fantastic story of

<li><p>He’ll believe you—he’s very __________________.</p></li>

<li>what people believe in</li>
</ol>
<p>Credo, to believe, is the origin of four other useful English
words.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Credo (KREE′-do)—personal belief, code of ethics; the principles
by which people guide their actions.</p></li>
<li><p>Creed—a close synonym of credo; in addition, a religious belief,
such as Catholicism, Judaism, Protestantism, Hinduism, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Credence (KREE′-dƏns)—belief, as in, “I place no credence in his
stories.” or “Why should I give any credence to what you say?”</p></li>
<li><p>Credentials (krƏ-DEN′-shƏls)—a document or documents proving a
person’s right to a title or privilege (i.e., a right to be believed),
as in, “The new ambassador presented his credentials to the State
Department.”</p></li>
<li><p>heads and tails</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can hardly close our book on the words suggested by ingenuous
without looking at the other side of the coin. If ingenuous means frank,
open, then disingenuous (dis-in-JEN′-y-Əs) should mean not frank or
open. But disingenuous people are far more than simply not ingenuous.
They are crafty, cunning, dishonest, artful, insincere,
untrustworthy—and they are all of these while making a pretense of being
simple, frank, and aboveboard. You are thinking of a wolf in sheep’s
clothing? It’s a good analogy.</p>
<p>Similarly, a remark may be disingenuous, as may also a statement, an
attitude, a confession, etc.</p>
<p>Add -ness to form the noun derived from disingenuous:

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>how to look</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root specto, to look, is the source of a host of common
English words: spectacle, spectator, inspect, retrospect (a looking
back), prospect (a looking ahead), etc. In a variant spelling, spic-,
the root is found in conspicuous (easily seen or looked at),
perspicacious, and perspicuous.</p>
<p>A perspicacious (pur′-spƏ-KAY′-shƏs) person is keen-minded, mentally
sharp, astute. Per- is a prefix meaning through; so the word
etymologically means looking through (matters, etc.) keenly,
intelligently. The noun: perspicacity (pur′-spƏ-KAS′-Ə-tee). Write an
alternate noun ending in -ness:</p>
<p>Perspicacity is a synonym of acumen (AK′-y′-mƏn), mental keenness,
sharpness, quickness; keen insight. The root is Latin acuo, to
sharpen.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>sharpness</li>
</ol>
<p>From acuo, to sharpen, come such words as acute, sharp, sudden, as
acute pain, an acute attack of appendicitis, acute reasoning, etc; and
acupuncture (AK′-y-punk′-chƏr), the insertion of a (sharp) needle into
the body for medical purposes. The noun form of acute, referring to the
mind or thinking, is acuteness or acuity (Ə-KY-Ə-tee); in other
contexts, acuteness only.</p>
<p>Acupuncture combines acuo, to sharpen, with punctus, point. When you
punctuate a sentence, you put various points (periods, commas, etc.)
where needed; when lightning punctuates the storm, or when the silence
is punctuated by the wailing of police sirens, again points,
etymologically speaking, interrupt the atmosphere, the quiet, etc.</p>
<p>If you are punctual, you’re right on the point of time (noun:
punctuality); if you’re punctilious (punk-TIL′-ee-Əs), you are exact,
scrupulous, very careful to observe the proper points of behavior,
procedure, etc. (noun: punctiliousness). And to puncture something, of
course, is to make a hole in it with a sharp point—as to puncture
someone’s tire, or figuratively, illusions, fantasies, or ego. Pungent
(PUN′-jƏnt) comes from another form of the root punctus (pungo, to
pierce sharply), so a pungent smell or taste is sharp, spicy, pricking
the nose or taste buds, so to speak; and a pungent wit sharply pierces
one’s sense of humor. Can you write the noun forms of this adjective?
__________________ or __________________.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>some more looking</li>
</ol>
<p>Perspicacious should not be confused with perspicuous
(pƏr-SPIK′-y-Əs). Here is the important distinction:</p>
<p>Perspicacious means smart, sharp, able to look through and understand
quickly. This adjective applies to persons, their reasoning, minds,
etc.</p>
<p>Perspicuous is the obverse side of the coin—it means easily
understood from one look, and applies to writing, style, books, and like
things that have to be understood. Hence it is a synonym of clear,
simple, lucid. If you write with perspicuous style, your language is
clear, easy to understand. If you are perspicacious, you understand
quickly, easily.</p>
<p>The noun form of perspicuous is perspicuity (pur′-spƏ-KY′-Ə-tee), or,
of course, perspicuousness.</p>
<p>A spectacle is something to look at; spectacles (eyeglasses) are the
means by which you get a comfortable and accurate look at the world.
Anything spectacular is, etymologically, worth looking at.</p>
<p>A spectator is one who looks at what’s happening.</p>
<p>To inspect is to look into something.</p>
<p>Retrospect (RET′-rƏ-spekt′) is a backward look—generally the word is
preceded by the preposition in, for instance, “His life in retrospect
seemed dreary and dull,” or “Most experiences seem more enjoyable in
retrospect than in actuality” (retro-, backward).</p>
<p>Prospect (PROS′-pekt′) is a forward look; prospective (prƏ-SPEK′-tiv)
is the adjective. What’s the prospect for inflation, for world peace,
for the domestic energy supply? Your prospective mother-in-law is the
one you can look forward to if you marry a certain person; similarly,
your prospective bride, groom, child, job, vacation, etc. is the person,
thing, or activity in the future that you look forward to. (The prefix
is pro-, forward, ahead, before.)</p>
<p>If you enjoy looking at yourself, figuratively speaking, then you
like to examine your mental processes and emotional reactions, in the
intense way characteristic of the introvert (see Chapter 3). Your mind’s
eye turns inward, and you spend a good deal of time analyzing yourself,
your character, your personality, your actions. Hence, since you look
inward, you are introspective (in′-trƏ-SPEK′-tiv)—the prefix is intro-,
inside, within. If you introspect (in′-trƏ-SPEKT′), you look inward and
examine your inner reactions. Too much introspection
(in′-trƏ-SPEK′-shƏn) or introspectiveness may lead to unhappiness or to
depressing thoughts or feelings of anxiety—few people have the courage
to see themselves as they really are.</p>
<p>There are times when you have to look around most carefully; you must
then be circumspect (SUR′-kƏm-spekt′)—watchful, cautious, alert
(circum-, around).</p>
<p>The noun is circumspection (sur′-kem-SPEK′-shƏn) or
circumspectness.</p>
<p>If something looks good or sensible, but actually is not, we call it
specious (SPEE′-shƏs). A specious argument sounds plausible, but in
reality is based on an error, a fallacy, or an untruth. The noun is
speciousness.</p>

<p>SESSION 36</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the great and the small</li>
</ol>
<p>You are familiar with Latin animus, mind. Animus and a related root,
anima, life principle, soul, spirit (in a sense, these meanings are all
very similar), are the source of such words as animal, animate and
inanimate, animated, and animation; knowing the meaning of the roots,
you have a better understanding of any word built on them.</p>
<p>Magnanimous contains, in addition to animus, mind, the root magnus,
large, great, which you recall from magniloquent. Magnanimous people
have such great, noble minds or souls that they are beyond seeking petty
revenge.</p>
<p>The noun is magnanimity (mag′-nƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>On the other hand, people who have tiny, tiny minds or souls are
pusillanimous (py′-sƏ-LAN′-Ə-mes)—Latin pusillus, tiny. Hence, they are
contemptibly petty and mean. The noun is pusillanimity
(py′-sƏ-lƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>Other words built on animus, mind:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>unanimous (y-NAN′-Ə-mƏs)—of one mind. If the Supreme Court hands
down a unanimous opinion, all the judges are of one mind (Latin unus,
one). The noun is unanimity (y′-nƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee).</p></li>
<li><p>equanimity (ee′-kwƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee or
ek′-wƏ-NIM′-Ə-tee)—etymologically, “equal (or balanced) mind.” Hence,
evenness or calmness of mind; composure. If you preserve your equanimity
under trying circumstances, you keep your temper, you do not get
confused, you remain calm (Latin aequus, equal).</p></li>
<li><p>animus (AN′-Ə-mƏs)—hostility, ill will, malevolence.
Etymologically, animus is simply mind, but has degenerated, as words
often do, to mean unfriendly mind. The word is most often used in a
pattern like, “I bear you no animus, even though you have tried to
destroy me.” (Such a statement shows real magnanimity!)</p></li>
<li><p>animosity (an′-Ə-MOS′-Ə-tee)—ill will, hostility. An exact
synonym of animus, and a more common word. It is used in patterns like,
“You feel a good deal of animosity, don’t you?”, “There is real
animosity between Bill and Ernie,” “If you bear me no animosity, why do
you treat me so badly?”</p></li>
<li><p>turning</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Versatile comes from verto, versus, to turn—versatile people can turn
their hand to many things successfully. The noun is versatility
(vur′-sƏ-TIL′-Ə-tee).</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Zeno and the front porch</li>
</ol>
<p>Centuries ago, in ancient Greece, the philosopher Zeno lectured on a
topic that still piques the human mind, to wit: “How to Live a Happy
Life.” Zeno would stand on a porch (the Greek word for which is stoa)
and hold forth somewhat as follows: people should free themselves from
intense emotion, be unmoved by both joy and sorrow, and submit without
complaint to unavoidable necessity.</p>
<p>Today, psychologists suggest pretty much the exact opposite—let your
emotions flow freely, express your love or animosity, don’t bottle up
your feelings. But in the fourth century B.C., when Zeno was expounding
his credo, his philosophy of control of the passions fell on receptive
ears. His followers were called Stoics, after the stoa, or porch, from
which the master lectured.</p>
<p>If we call people stoical, we mean that they bear their pain or
sorrow without complaint, they meet adversity with unflinching
fortitude. This sounds very noble, you will admit—actually, according to
modern psychological belief, it is healthier not to be so stoical.
Stoicism (STŌ′-Ə-siz-Əm) may be an admirable virtue (mainly because we
do not then have to listen to the stoic’s troubles), but it can be
overdone.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>fear and trembling</li>
</ol>
<p>Intrepid is from Latin trepido, to tremble. Intrepid people exhibit
courage and fearlessness (and not a single tremble!) when confronted by
dangers from which you and I would run like the cowards we are. (You
recognize the negative prefix in-.)</p>
<p>The noun: intrepidity (in′-trƏ-PID′-Ə-tee), or, of course,
intrepidness.</p>
<p>Trepido is the source also of trepidation (trep′-Ə-DAY′-shƏn)—great
fear, trembling, or alarm.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>quick flash</li>
</ol>
<p>Scintilla, in Latin, is a quick, bright spark; in English the word
scintilla (sin-TIL′-Ə) may also mean a spark, but more commonly refers
to a very small particle (which, in a sense, a spark is), as in, “There
was not a scintilla of evidence against him.”</p>
<p>In the verb scintillate (SIN′-tƏ-layt′), the idea of the spark
remains; someone who scintillates sparkles with charm and wit, flashes
brightly with humor. The noun is scintillation (sin′-tƏ-LAY′-shƏn).</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>city and country</li>
</ol>
<p>People who live in the big city go to theaters, attend the opera,
visit museums and picture galleries, browse in bookstores, and shop at
Robinson’s, Bloomingdale’s, Marshall Field, or other large department
stores.</p>
<p>These activities fill them with culture and sophistication.</p>
<p>Also, they crowd into jammed subway trains or buses, squeeze into
packed elevators, cross the street in competition with high-powered
motorcars, patiently stand in line outside of movie houses, and then
wait again in the lobby for seats to be vacated.</p>
<p>Also, they have the privilege of spending two hours a day going to
and coming from work.</p>
<p>As a result, city-dwellers are refined, polished, courteous—or so the
etymology of urbane (from Latin urbs, city) tells us. (And you must be
absurdly credulous, if not downright gullible, to believe it.) The noun
is urbanity (ur-BAN′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>So urbane people are gracious, affable, cultivated, suave,
tactful—add any similar adjectives you can think of.</p>
<p>Urban (UR′-bƏn) as an adjective simply refers to cities—urban
affairs, urban areas, urban populations, urban life, urban development,
etc.</p>
<p>Consider some prefixes: sub-, near; inter-, between; intra-, inside,
within; ex-, out.</p>
<p>Add each prefix to the root urbs, using the adjective suffix -an:</p>
<p>sub__________________: near the city</p>
<p>(Sub- has a number of meanings: under, near, close to, etc.)</p>
<p>inter__________________: between cities</p>
<p>intra__________________: within a city</p>
<p>ex__________________: out of the city</p>
<p>The suburbs are residential sections, or small communities, close to
a large city; Larchmont is a suburb of New York City, Whittier a suburb
of Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Suburbia (sƏ-BUR′-bee-Ə) may designate suburbs as a group; suburban
residents, or suburbanites (sƏ-BUR′-bƏ-nīts′), as a group; or the
typical manners, modes of living, customs, etc. of suburban
residents.</p>
<p>An interurban bus travels between cities, an intraurban bus within a
single city.</p>
<p>An exurb (EKS′-urb) lies well beyond, way outside, a large city, and
generally refers to a region inhabited by well-to-do families. Exurb has
derived forms corresponding to those of suburb. Can you construct
them?</p>
<p>Plural noun: __________________</p>
<p>Adjective: __________________</p>
<p>Resident: __________________</p>
<p>As a group; manners, customs, etc.: __________________</p>
<p>Urbs is the city; Latin rus, ruris is the country, i.e., farmland,
fields, etc. So rural (RR′-Əl) refers to country or farm regions,
agriculture, etc.—a wealthy rural area.</p>
<p>Rustic (RUS′-tik) as an adjective may describe furniture or dwellings
made of roughhewn wood, or furnishings suitable to a farmhouse; or, when
applied to a person, is an antonym of urbane—unsophisticated, boorish,
lacking in social graces, uncultured. Noun: rusticity (rus-TIS′-Ə-tee).
Rustic is also a noun designating a person with such characteristics, as
in, “He was considered a rustic by his classmates, all of whom came from
cultured and wealthy backgrounds.”</p>
<p>Urbane and rustic, when applied to people, are emotionally charged
words. Urbane is complimentary, rustic derogatory.1</p>
<p>To rusticate (RUS′-tƏ-kayt′) is to spend time in the country, away
from the turmoil and tensions of big-city life. Can you construct the
noun? __________________.</p>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18)</p>
<p>WORDS INFLUENCE YOUR THINKING</p>
<p>By now, you have thoroughly explored hundreds upon hundreds of
valuable words and scores upon scores of important Greek and Latin
roots.</p>
<p>As you went along you stopped at frequent intervals to say aloud,
think about, work with, and recall the words you were adding to your
vocabulary.</p>
<p>By now, therefore, the words you have been learning are probably old
friends of yours; they have started to influence your thinking, have
perhaps begun to appear in your conversation, and have certainly become
conspicuous in your reading. In short, they have been effective in
making changes in your intellectual climate.</p>
<p>Let us pause now for another checkup of the success of your study. In
the next chapter, you will find a second Comprehensive Test. Take the
test cold if you feel that all the material is at your fingertips; or
spend a little time reviewing Chapters 9, 10, 11, and 12 if you believe
such review is necessary.</p>

<p>1 Incidentally, a word used with a derogatory connotation (bitch,
piggish, glutton, idiot, etc.) is called a pejorative (pe-JAWR′-Ə-tiv).
Pejorative is also an adjective, as in, “She spoke in pejorative terms
about her ex-husband.” The derivation is Latin pejor, worse.</p>
