<hr />
<p>SESSION 24</p>
<p>Perhaps some of your richest and most satisfying experiences have
been with people to whom you can just talk, talk, talk. As you speak,
previously untapped springs of ideas and emotions begin to flow; you
hear yourself saying things you never thought you knew.</p>
<p>What kinds of people might you find yourself in conversation with? In
this chapter we start by examining ten types, discovering the adjective
that aptly describes each one.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>saying little</li>
</ol>
<p>There are some people who just don’t like to talk. It’s not that they
prefer to listen. Good listeners hold up their end of the conversation
delightfully—with appropriate facial expressions; with empathetic
smiles, giggles, squeals, and sighs at just the right time; and with
encouraging nods or phrases like “Go on!”, “Fantastic!”, “And then what
happened?”</p>
<p>These people like neither to talk nor to listen—they act as if
conversation is a bore, even a painful waste of time. Try to engage
them, and the best you may expect for your efforts is a vacant stare, a
noncommittal grunt, or an impatient silence. Finally, in frustration,
you give up, thinking. “Are they self-conscious? Do they hate people? Do
they hate me?”</p>
<p>The adjective: taciturn</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>saying little—meaning much</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a well-known anecdote about Calvin Coolidge, who, when he
was President, was often called (though probably not to his face)
“Silent Cal”:</p>
<p>A young newspaperwoman was sitting next to him at a banquet, so the
story goes, and turned to him mischievously.</p>
<p>“Mr. Coolidge,” she said, “I have a bet with my editor that I can get
you to say more than two words to me this evening.”</p>
<p>“You lose,” Coolidge rejoined simply.</p>
<p>The adjective: laconic</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>when the words won’t come</li>
</ol>
<p>Under the pressure of some strong emotion—fear, rage, anger, for
example—people may find it difficult, or even impossible, to utter
words, to get their feelings unjumbled and untangled enough to form
understandable sentences. They undoubtedly have a lot they want to say,
but the best they can do is sputter!</p>
<p>The adjective: inarticulate</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>much talk, little sense</li>
</ol>
<p>Miss Bates, a character in Emma, a novel by Jane Austen:</p>
<p>“So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been
for this particular circumstance, of her being able to come here so
soon. My mother is so delighted! For she is to be three months with us
at least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have
the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells
are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to
come over and see her directly. I was going to say, but, however,
different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her
mother, or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we
shall see presently in Jane’s letter …”</p>
<p>The adjective: garrulous</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>unoriginal</li>
</ol>
<p>Some people are completely lacking in originality and imagination—and
their talk shows it. Everything they say is trite, hackneyed,
commonplace, humorless—their speech patterns are full of clichés and
stereotypes, their phraseology is without sparkle.</p>
<p>The adjective: banal</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>words, words, words!</li>
</ol>
<p>They talk and talk and talk—it’s not so much the quantity you object
to as the repetitiousness. They phrase, rephrase, and re-rephrase their
thoughts—using far more words than necessary, overwhelming you with
words, drowning you with them, until your only thought is how to escape,
or maybe how to die.</p>
<p>The adjective: verbose</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>words in quick succession</li>
</ol>
<p>They are rapid, fluent talkers, the words seeming to roll off their
tongues with such ease and lack of effort, and sometimes with such
copiousness, that you listen with amazement.</p>
<p>The adjective: voluble</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>words that convince</li>
</ol>
<p>They express their ideas persuasively, forcefully, brilliantly, and
in a way that calls for wholehearted assent and agreement from an
intelligent listener.</p>
<p>The adjective: cogent</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>the sound and the fury</li>
</ol>
<p>Their talk is loud, noisy, clamorous, vehement. What may be lacking
in content is compensated for in force and loudness.</p>
<p>The adjective: vociferous</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>quantity</li>
</ol>
<p>They talk a lot—a whole lot. They may be voluble, vociferous,
garrulous, verbose, but never inarticulate, taciturn, or laconic. No
matter. It’s the quantity and continuity that are most conspicuous.
“Were you vaccinated with a phonograph needle?” is the question you are
tempted to ask as you listen.</p>
<p>The adjective: loquacious</p>
<p>These ten words revolve around the idea of varying kinds and ways of
talking and not talking. Many of the adjectives are close in meaning,
but each contains its unique difference.</p>

<p>Can you recall the words?</p>
<p>Do you know that new nerve patterns are formed by repeated actions?
As a very young child, you tied your shoelaces and buttoned your
clothing with great concentration—the activity was directed, controlled,
purposeful, exciting. As you grew older and more skillful, you tied and
buttoned with scarcely a thought of what you were doing. Your fingers
flew about their task almost automatically—for the habit had formed a
nerve pattern and the action needed little if any conscious
attention.</p>
<p>That’s simple enough to understand. If you do not remember your own
experiences, you can observe the phenomenon of struggling with a skill,
mastering it, and finally making it a self-starting habit by watching
any young child. Or you can simply take my word for it.</p>
<p>You need not take my word for the way a mastery of new words is
acquired. You can see in yourself, as you work with this book, how
adding words to your vocabulary is exactly analogous to a child’s
mastery of shoelacing. First you struggle with the concepts; then you
eventually master them; finally, by frequent work with the new words
(now you see the reason for the great number of exercises, the
repetitious writing, saying, thinking) you build up new nerve patterns
and you begin to use the new words with scarcely any consciousness of
what you are doing.</p>
<p>Watch this common but important phenomenon closely as you do the next
exercise. Your total absorption of the material so far has given you
complete mastery of our ten basic words. Prove that you are beginning to
form new nerve patterns in relation to these words by writing the one
that fits each brief definition. The more quickly you think of the word
that applies, the surer you can be that using these words will soon be
as automatic and unself-conscious as putting on your shoes or
buttoning/zipping yourself up in the morning.</p>

<p>(End of Session 24)</p>
<p>SESSION 25</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>about keeping one’s mouth shut</li>
</ol>
<p>If you let your mind play over some of the taciturn people you know,
you will realize that their abnormal disinclination to conversation
makes them seem morose, sullen, and unfriendly. Cal Coolidge’s
taciturnity was world-famous, and no one, I am sure, ever conceived of
him as cheerful, overfriendly, or particularly sociable. There are
doubtless many possible causes of such verbal rejection of the world:
perhaps lack of self-assurance, feelings of inadequacy or hostility,
excessive seriousness or introspection, or just plain having nothing to
say. Maybe, in Coolidge’s case, he was saving up his words—after he did
not “choose to run” in 1928, he wrote a daily column for the New York
Herald Tribune at a rumored price of two dollars a word—and, according
to most critics (probably all Democrats), he had seemed wiser when he
kept silent. Coolidge hailed from New England, and taciturnity
(tas-Ə-TURN′-Ə-tee) in that part of the country, so some people say, is
considered a virtue. Who knows, the cause may be geographical and
climatic, rather than psychological.</p>
<p>Taciturn is from a Latin verb taceo, to be silent, and is one of
those words whose full meaning cannot be expressed by any other
combination of syllables. It has many synonyms, among them silent,
uncommunicative, reticent, reserved, secretive, close-lipped, and
close-mouthed; but no other word indicates the permanent, habitual, and
temperamental disinclination to talk implied by taciturn.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>better left unsaid</li>
</ol>
<p>Tacit (TAS′-it) derives also from taceo.</p>
<p>Here is a man dying of cancer. He suspects what his disease is, and
everyone else, of course, knows. Yet he never mentions the dread word,
and no one who visits him ever breathes a syllable of it in his hearing.
It is tacitly understood by all concerned that the word will remain
forever unspoken.</p>
<p>(Such a situation today, however, may or may not be typical—there
appears to be a growing tendency among physicians and family to be open
and honest with people who are dying.)</p>
<p>Consider another situation:</p>
<p>An executive is engaging in extracurricular activities with her
secretary. Yet during office time they are as formal and distant as any
two human beings can well be. Neither of them ever said to the other,
“Now, look here, we may be lovers after five o’clock, but between nine
and five we must preserve the utmost decorum, okay?” Such speech, such a
verbal arrangement, is considered unnecessary—so we may say that the two
have a tacit agreement (i.e., nothing was ever actually said) to
maintain a complete employer-employee relationship during office
hours.</p>
<p>Anything tacit, then, is unspoken, unsaid, not verbalized. We speak
of a tacit agreement, arrangement, acceptance, rejection, assent,
refusal, etc. A person is never called tacit.</p>
<p>The noun is tacitness (TAS′-it-nƏs). (Bear in mind that you can
transform any adjective into a noun by adding -ness, though in many
cases there may be a more sophisticated, or more common, noun form.)</p>
<p>Changing the a of the root taceo to i, and adding the prefix re-,
again, and the adjective suffix -ent, we can construct the English word
reticent (RET′-Ə-sƏnt).</p>
<p>Someone is reticent who prefers to keep silent, whether out of
shyness, embarrassment, or fear of revealing what should not be
revealed. (The idea of “againness” in the prefix has been lost in the
current meaning of the word.)</p>
<p>We have frequently made nouns out of -ent adjectives. Write two
possible noun forms of reticent: __________________, or, less commonly,
__________________.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>talk, talk, talk!</li>
</ol>
<p>Loquacious people love to talk. This adjective is not necessarily a
put-down, but the implication, when you so characterize such people, is
that you wish they would pause for breath once in a while so that you
can get your licks in. The noun is loquacity (lō-KWAS′-Ə-tee), or, of
course, loquaciousness.</p>
<p>The word derives from Latin loquor, to speak, a root found also
in:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>soliloquy (sƏ-LIL′-Ə-kwee)—a speech to oneself (loquor plus solus,
alone), or, etymologically, a speech when alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>We often talk to ourselves, but usually silently, the words going
through our minds but not actually passing our lips. The term soliloquy
is commonly applied to utterances made in a play by characters who are
speaking their thoughts aloud so the audience won’t have to guess. The
soliloquist (sƏ-LIL′-Ə-kwist) may be alone; or other members of the cast
may be present on stage, but of course they don’t hear what’s being
said, because they’re not supposed to know. Eugene O’Neill made novel
uses of soliloquies in Mourning Becomes Electra—the characters made
honest disclosures of their feelings and thoughts to the audience, but
kept the other players in the dark.</p>
<p>The verb is to soliloquize (sƏ-LIL′-Ə-kwīz′).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>A ventriloquist (ven-TRIL′-Ə-kwist) is one who can throw his
voice. A listener thinks the sound is coming from some source other than
the person speaking. The combining root is Latin venter, ventris, belly;
etymologically, ventriloquism (ven-TRIL′-Ə-kwiz-Əm) is the art of
“speaking from the belly.” The adjective is ventriloquistic
(ven-tril′-Ə-KWIS′-tik). Can you figure out how the verb will end? Write
the verb: __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Colloquial (kƏ-LŌ′-kwee-Əl) combines loquor, to speak, with the
prefix con-. (Con- is spelled col- before a root starting with l; cor-
before a root starting with r; com- before a root starting with m, p, or
b.) When people speak together they are engaging in conversation—and
their language is usually more informal and less rigidly grammatical
than what you might expect in writing or in public addresses. Colloquial
patterns are perfectly correct—they are simply informal, and suitable to
everyday conversation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A colloquialism (kƏ-LŌ′-kwee-Ə-liz-Əm), therefore, is a
conversational-style expression, like “He hasn’t got any” or “Who are
you going with?” as contrasted to the formal or literary “He has none”
or “With whom are you going?” Colloquial English is the English you and
I talk on everyday occasions—it is not slangy, vulgar, or
illiterate.</p>

<li>A circumlocution (sur-kƏm-lō-KY′-shƏn) is, etymologically, a

adjective suffix -ory.</li>

<p>SESSION 26</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a Spartan virtue</li>
</ol>
<p>In ancient Sparta, originally known as Laconia, the citizens were
long-suffering, hard-bitten, stoical, and military-minded, and were even
more noted for their economy of speech than Vermonters, if that is
possible. Legend has it that when Philip of Macedonia was storming the
gates of Sparta (or Laconia), he sent a message to the besieged king
saying, “If we capture your city we will burn it to the ground.” A
one-word answer came back: “If.” It was now probably Philip’s turn to be
speechless, though history does not record his reaction.</p>
<p>It is from the name Laconia that we derive our word laconic—pithy,
concise, economical in the use of words almost to the point of curtness;
precisely the opposite of verbose.</p>
<p>Like the man who was waiting at a lunch counter for a ham sandwich.
When it was ready, the clerk inquired politely, “Will you eat it here,
or take it with you?”</p>
<p>“Both,” was the laconic reply.</p>
<p>Or like the woman who was watching a lush imbibing dry martinis at a
Third Avenue bar in New York City. The drunk downed the contents of each
cocktail glass at one gulp, daintily nibbled and swallowed the bowl,
then finally turned the glass over and ate the base. The stem he threw
into a corner. This amazing gustatory feat went on for half an hour,
until a dozen stems were lying shattered in the corner, and the drunk
had chewed and swallowed enough bowls and bases to start a glass
factory. He suddenly turned to the lady and asked belligerently, “I
suppose you think I’m cuckoo, don’t you?” “Sure—the stem is the best
part,” was the laconic answer.</p>
<p>(It was doubtless this same gentleman, in his accustomed state of
intoxication, who found himself painfully weaving his way along Wilshire
Boulevard in Beverly Hills, California—he had somehow gotten on a TWA
jetliner instead of the subway—when he realized, almost too late, that
he was going to bump into a smartly dressed young woman who had just
stepped out of her Mercedes-Benz to go window-shopping along the avenue.
He quickly veered left, but by some unexplainable magnetic attraction
the woman veered in the same direction, again making collision
apparently inevitable. With an adroit maneuver, the drunk swung to the
right—the lady, by now thoroughly disoriented, did the same. Finally
both jammed on the brakes and came to a dead stop, face to face, and not
six inches apart; and as the alcoholic fumes assailed the young lady’s
nostrils, she sneered at the reeking, swaying man, as much in
frustration as in contempt: “Oh! How gauche!” “Fine!” was his happy
response. “How goesh with you?” This answer, however, is not laconic,
merely confused.)</p>
<p>We have learned that -ness, -ity, and -ism are suffixes that
transform adjectives into nouns—and all three can be used with
laconic:</p>
<p>…with characteristic laconicness (lƏ-KON′-Ək-nƏs)</p>
<p>…her usual laconicity (lak′-Ə-NIS′-Ə-tce)</p>
<p>…his habitual laconism (LAK′-Ə-niz-Əm)</p>
<p>…with, for him, unusual laconicism (lƏ-KON′-Ə-siz-Əm)</p>
<p>A laconism is also the expression itself that is pithy and concise,
as the famous report from a naval commander in World War II: “Saw sub,
sank same.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>brilliant</li>
</ol>
<p>Cogent is a term of admiration. A cogent argument is well put,
convincing, hardly short of brilliant. Cogency (KŌ′-jƏn-see) shows a
keen mind, an ability to think clearly and logically. The word derives
from the Latin verb cogo, to drive together, compel, force. A cogent
argument compels acceptance because of its logic, its persuasiveness,
its appeal to one’s sense of reason.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>back to talk</li>
</ol>
<p>You will recall that loquor, to speak, is the source of loquacity,
soliloquy, ventriloquism, colloquialism, circumlocution. This root is
also the base on which eloquent (EL′-Ə-kwƏnt), magniloquent
(mag-NIL′-Ə-kwƏnt), and grandiloquent (gran-DIL′-Ə-kwƏnt) are built.</p>
<p>The eloquent person speaks out (e-, from ex-, out), is vividly
expressive, fluent, forceful, or persuasive in language (“the
prosecutor’s eloquent plea to the jury”). The word is partially
synonymous with cogent, but cogent implies irresistible logical
reasoning and intellectual keenness, while eloquent suggests artistic
expression, strong emotional appeal, the skillful use of language to
move and arouse a listener.</p>
<p>Magniloquent (magnus, large) and grandiloquent (grandis, grand) are
virtually identical in meaning. Magniloquence or grandiloquence is the
use of high-flown, grandiose, even pompous language; of large and
impressive words; of lofty, flowery, or over-elegant phraseology. Home
is a place of residence; wife is helpmate, helpmeet, or better half;
women are the fair sex; children are offspring or progeny; a doctor is a
member of the medical fraternity; people are the species Homo sapiens,
etc., etc.</p>
<p>Loquacious, verbose, voluble, and garrulous people are all talkative;
but each type, you will recall, has a special quality.</p>
<p>If you are loquacious, you talk a lot because you like to talk and
doubtless have a lot to say.</p>
<p>If you are verbose, you smother your ideas with excess words, with
such an overabundance of words that your listener either drops into a
state of helpless confusion or falls asleep.</p>
<p>If you are voluble, you speak rapidly, fluently, glibly, without
hesitation, stutter, or stammer; you are vocal, verbal, and highly
articulate.</p>
<p>If you are garrulous, you talk constantly, and usually aimlessly and
meaninglessly, about trifles. We often hear the word used in “a
garrulous old man” or “a garrulous old woman,” since in very advanced
age the mind may wander and lose the ability to discriminate between the
important and the unimportant, between the interesting and the dull.</p>
<p>Verbose is from Latin verbum, word—the verbose person is wordy.</p>
<p>Voluble comes from Latin volvo, volutus, to roll—words effortlessly
roll off the voluble speaker’s tongue.</p>
<p>And garrulous derives from Latin garrio, to chatter—a garrulous
talker chatters away like a monkey.</p>
<p>The suffix -ness can be added to all these adjectives to form nouns.
Alternate noun forms end in -ity:</p>
<p>verbosity (vƏr-BOS′-Ə-tee)</p>
<p>volubility (vor-yƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee)</p>
<p>garrulity (gƏ-RL′-Ə-tee)</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>at large</li>
</ol>
<p>We discovered magnus, large, big, great, in Chapter 9, in discussing
Magnavox (etymologically, “big voice”), and find it again in
magniloquent (etymologically, “talking big”). The root occurs in a
number of other words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Magnanimous (mag-NAN′-Ə-mƏs)—big-hearted, generous, forgiving
(etymologically, “great-minded”). (Magnus plus animus, mind.) We’ll
discuss this word in depth in Chapter 12.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnate (MAG′-nayt)—a person of great power or influence, a big
wheel, as a business magnate.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnify—to make larger, or make seem larger (magnus plus -fy from
facio, to make), as in “magnify your problems.”</p></li>
<li><p>Magnificent—magnus plus fic-, from facio.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnitude—magnus plus the common noun suffix -tude, as in
fortitude, multitude, gratitude, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnum (as of champagne or wine)—a large bottle, generally two
fifths of a gallon.</p></li>
<li><p>Magnum opus (MAG′-nƏm Ō′-pes)—etymologically, a “big work”;
actually, the greatest work, or masterpiece, of an artist, writer, or
composer. Opus is the Latin word for work; the plural of opus is used in
the English word opera, etymologically, “a number of works,” actually a
musical drama containing overture, singing, and other forms of music,
i.e., many musical works. The verb form opero, to work, occurs in
operate, co-operate, operator, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>words, words, words!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Latin verbum is word. A verb is the important word in a sentence;
verbatim (vƏr-BAY′-tim) is word-for-word (a verbatim report).</p>
<p>Verbal (VUR′-bƏl), ending in the adjective suffix -al, may refer
either to a verb, or to words in general (a verbal fight); or it may
mean, loosely, oral or spoken, rather than written (verbal agreement or
contract); or, describing people (“she is quite verbal”), it may refer
to a ready ability to put feelings or thoughts into words.</p>
<p>Working from verbal, can you add a common verb suffix to form a word
meaning to put into words? __________________</p>
<p>Verbiage (VUR′-bee-Əj) has two meanings: an excess of words (“Such
verbiage!”); or a style or manner of using words (medical verbiage,
military verbiage).</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>roll on, and on!</li>
</ol>
<p>Volvo, volutus, to roll, the source of voluble, is the root on which
many important English words are based.</p>
<p>Revolve (rƏ-VOLV′)—roll again (and again), or keep turning round.
Wheels revolve, the earth revolves around the sun, the cylinder of a
revolver revolves, (The prefix is re-, back or again.)</p>
<p>The noun is revolution (rev-Ə-L′-shƏn), which can be one such
complete rolling, or, by logical extension, a radical change of any sort
(TV was responsible for a revolution in the entertainment industry),
especially political (the American, or French, Revolution). The
adjective revolutionary (rev′-Ə-L′-shƏn-air′-ee) introduces us to a new
adjective suffix, -ary, as in contrary, disciplinary, stationary,
imaginary, etc. (But -ary is sometimes also a noun suffix, as in
dictionary, commentary, etc.)</p>
<p>Add different prefixes to volvo to construct two more English
words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>involve—etymologically, “roll in” (“I didn’t want to get
involved!”). Noun: involvement.</p></li>
<li><p>evolve (Ə-VOLV′)—etymologically, “roll out” (e-, out); hence to
unfold, or gradually develop (“The final plan evolved from some informal
discussions”; “The political party evolved from a group of interested
citizens who met frequently to protest government actions”).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>By analogy with the forms derived from revolve, can you construct the
noun and adjective of evolve? Noun: __________________. Adjective:

<p>SESSION 27</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>front and back—and uncles</li>
</ol>
<p>The ventriloquist appears to talk from the belly (venter, ventris
plus loquor) rather than through the lips (or such was the strange
perception of the person who first used the word).</p>
<p>Venter, ventris, belly, is the root on which ventral (VEN′-trƏl) and
ventricle are built.</p>
<p>The ventral side of an animal, for example, is the front or anterior
side—the belly side.</p>
<p>A ventricle (VEN′-trƏ-kƏl) is a hollow organ or cavity, or, logically
enough, belly, as one of the two chambers of the heart, or one of the
four chambers of the brain. The ventricles of the heart are the lower
chambers, and receive blood from the auricles, or upper chambers. The
auricle (AW′-rƏ-kƏl), so named because it is somewhat ear-shaped (Latin
auris, ear), receives blood from the veins; the auricles send the blood
into the ventricles, which in turn pump the blood into the arteries.
(It’s all very complicated, but fortunately it works.)</p>
<p>The adjective form of ventricle is ventricular (ven-TRIK′-yƏ-lƏr),
which may refer to a ventricle, or may mean having a belly-like
bulge.</p>
<p>Now that you see how ventricular is formed from ventricle, can you
figure out the adjective of auricle? __________________. How about the
adjective of vehicle? __________________. Of circle?
__________________.</p>
<p>No doubt you wrote auricular (aw-RIK′-yƏ-lƏr), vehicular, and
circular, and have discovered that nouns ending in -cle from adjectives
ending in -cular.</p>
<p>So you can now be the first person on your block to figure out the
adjective derived from:</p>
<p>clavicle: __________________</p>
<p>cuticle: __________________</p>
<p>vesicle: __________________</p>
<p>esticle: __________________</p>
<p>uncle: __________________</p>
<p>The answers of course are clavicular, cuticular, vesicular,
testicular—and for uncle you have every right to shout “No fair!” (But
where is it written that life is fair?)</p>
<p>The Latin word for uncle (actually, uncle on the mother’s side) is
avunculus, from which we get avuncular (Ə-VUNG′-kyƏ-lƏr), referring to
an uncle.</p>
<p>Now what about an uncle? Well, traditional or stereotypical uncles
are generally kindly, permissive, indulgent, protective—and often give
helpful advice. So anyone who exhibits one or more of such traits to
another (usually younger) person is avuncular or acts in an avuncular
capacity.</p>
<p>So, at long last, to get back to ventral. If there’s a front or belly
side, anatomically, there must be a reverse—a back side. This is the
dorsal (DAWR′-sƏl) side, from Latin dorsum, the root on which the verb
endorse (en-DAWRS′) is built.</p>
<p>If you endorse a check, you sign it on the back side; if you endorse
a plan, an idea, etc., you back it, you express your approval or
support. The noun is endorsement (en-DAWRS′-mƏnt).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>the noise and the fury</li>
</ol>
<p>Vociferous derives from Latin vox, vocis, voice (a root you met in
Chapter 9), plus fero, to bear or carry. A vociferous rejoinder carries
a lot of voice—i.e., it is vehement, loud, noisy, clamorous, shouting.
The noun is vociferousness (vō-SIF′-Ə-rƏs-nƏs); the verb is to
vociferate (vō-SIF′-Ə-rayt′). Can you form the noun derived from the
verb? __________________.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>to sleep or not to sleep—that is the question</li>
</ol>
<p>The root fero is found also in somniferous (som-NIF′-Ə-rƏs),
carrying, bearing, or bringing sleep. So a somniferous lecture is so
dull and boring that it is sleep-inducing.</p>
<p>Fero is combined with somnus, sleep, in somniferous. (The suffix -ous
indicates what part of speech? __________________.)</p>
<p>Tack on the negative prefix in- to somnus to construct insomnia
(in-SOM′-nee-Ə), the abnormal inability to fall asleep when sleep is
required or desired. The unfortunate victim of this disability is an
insomniac (in-SOM′-nee-ak), the adjective is insomnious
(in-SOM′-nee-Əs). (So -ous, in case you could not answer the question in
the preceding paragraph, is an adjective suffix.)</p>
<p>Add a different adjective suffix to somnus to derive somnolent
(SOM′-nƏ-lƏnt), sleepy, drowsy. Can you construct the noun form of
somnolent? __________________ or__________________.</p>
<p>Combine somnus with ambulo, to walk, and you have somnambulism
(som-NAM′-byƏ-liz-Əm), walking in one’s sleep. With your increasing
skill in using etymology to form words, write the term for the person
who is a sleepwalker.__________________. Now add to the word you wrote a
two-letter adjective suffix we have learned, to form the adjective:
__________________.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>a walkaway</li>
</ol>
<p>An ambulatory (AM′-byƏ-lƏ-taw′-ree) patient, as in a hospital or
convalescent home, is finally well enough to get out of bed and walk
around. A perambulator (pƏ-RAM′-byƏ-lay′-tƏr), a word used more in
England than in the United States, and often shortened to pram, is a
baby carriage, a vehicle for walking an infant through the streets
(per-, through). To perambulate (pƏ-RAM′-byƏ-layt′) is, etymologically,
“to walk through”; hence, to stroll around. Can you write the noun form
of this verb? __________________.</p>
<p>To amble (AM′-bƏl) is to walk aimlessly; an ambulance is so called
because originally it was composed of two stretcher-bearers who walked
off the battlefield with a wounded soldier; and a preamble
(PREE′-am-bƏl) is, by etymology, something that “walks before” (pre-,
before, beforehand), hence an introduction or introductory statement, as
the preamble to the U. S. Constitution (“We the people …”), a preamble
to the speech, etc; or any event that is introductory or preliminary to
another, as in “An increase in inflationary factors in the economy is
often a preamble to a drop in the stock market.”</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>back to sleep</li>
</ol>
<p>Somnus is one Latin word for sleep—sopor is another. A soporific
(sop′-Ə-RIF′-ik) lecture, speaker, style of delivery, etc. will put the
audience to sleep (fic- from facio, to make), and a soporific is a
sleeping pill.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>noun suffixes</li>
</ol>
<p>You know that -ness can be added to any adjective to construct the
noun form. Write the noun derived from inarticulate: __________________.
Inarticulate is a combination of the negative prefix in- and Latin
articulus, a joint. The inarticulate person has trouble joining words
together coherently. If you are quite articulate (ahr-TIK′-yƏ-lƏt), on
the other hand, you join your words together easily, you are verbal,
vocal, possibly even voluble. The verb to articulate (ahr-TIK′-yƏ-layt′)
is to join (words), i.e., to express your vocal sounds—as in “Please
articulate more clearly.” Can you write the noun derived from the verb
articulate? __________________.</p>
<p>Another, and very common, noun suffix attached to adjectives is, as
you have discovered, -ity. So the noun form of banal is either
banalness, or, more commonly, banality (bƏ-NAL′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>Bear in mind, then, that -ness and -ity are common noun suffixes
attached to adjectives, and -ion (or -ation) is a noun suffix frequenty
affixed to verbs (to articulate—articulation; to vocalize—vocalization;
to perambulate—perambulation).</p>

<p>TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The present participle (or -ing form) of the Latin verb opero, to
work, is operans, working. The form operandi means of working. Can you
figure out the literal meaning of the phrase modus operandi, sometimes
used to signify the characteristic methods or procedures used by certain
criminals? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Circum-, we have learned, is a prefix meaning around, as in
circumlocution, circumference, circumcision, circumnavigation, etc.
Thinking of the root scribo, scriptus, to write, can you figure out the
word meaning writing, or written material, around (the edge of
something)? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>You know the roots somnus and loquor. Can you combine these two
roots to form an adjective meaning talking in one’s sleep?
__________________. Can you write the noun form of this adjective?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>We have discovered auris, ear, as in auricle. Can you figure out
the specialty of the physician called an aurist?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Verbal, from verbum, refers to words; oral, from os, oris, the
mouth, refers to spoken words or sounds. Can you analyze aural and
decide on its meaning? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>A somnambulist walks in his sleep. What does a noctambulist do?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Soporific, combining sopor, sleep, with fic- (from facio), to
make, means inducing or causing sleep. Use somnus, another root for
sleep, to construct a word that has the same form and meaning as
soporific: __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Perambulate is to walk through. Use another Latin prefix to
construct a verb meaning to walk around __________________.</p></li>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18)</p>
<p>BECOMING ALERT TO NEW IDEAS</p>
<p>Some chapters back I suggested that since words are symbols of ideas,
one of the most effective means of building your vocabulary is to read
books that deal with new ideas. Along that line, I further suggested
that the fields of psychology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis would be
good starting points, and I mentioned a number of exciting books to work
with.</p>
<p>Needless to say, you will not wish to neglect other fields, and so I
want to recommend, at this point, highly readable books in additional
subjects. All these books will increase your familiarity with the world
of ideas—all of them, therefore, will help you build a superior
vocabulary.</p>

<p>All but one or two of these stimulating and informative books are
available in inexpensive paperback editions—most of them can be found in
any large public library. Any one of them will provide an evening of
entertainment and excitement far more rewarding than watching TV, will
possibly open for you new areas of knowledge and understanding, and will
undoubtedly contain so many of the words you have learned in this book
that you will again and again experience the delicious shock of
recognition that I spoke of in an earlier chapter.</p>
<p>Additionally, you may encounter words you have never seen before that
are built on roots you are familiar with—and you will then realize how
simple it is to figure out the probable meaning of even the most
esoteric term once you have become an expert in roots, prefixes, and
suffixes.</p>

<p>Brief Intermission Six</p>
<p>DO YOU ALWAYS USE THE PROPER WORD?</p>
<p>The fact is that grammar is getting more liberal every day. Common
usage has put a stamp of approval on many expressions which your
grandmother would not have dared utter in her most intimate
conversation—not if she believed she was in the habit of using good
English. It is me; have you got a cold?; it’s a nice day; can I have
another piece of cake?; she is a most aggravating child; will everybody
please remove their hats—all these today represent perfectly correct
grammar for everyday conversation. Modern grammar research reports that
these expressions have become universal in educated speech.</p>
<p>However, such a liberal policy does not mean that all bars are down.
Only a person whose speech borders on the illiterate would make such
statements as: can you learn me to swim?; he don’t live here no more; we
ain’t working so good; me and my husband are glad to see you. There are
still certain minimum essentials of good English that the cultivated
speaker carefully observes.</p>
<p>Is your grammar as good as the next person’s? Here’s a quick test by
which you can measure your ability.</p>
<p>Check the preferable choice in each sentence, then compare your
results with the key at the end. Allowing 4 per cent for each correct
answer, consider 92–100 excellent, 76–88 good, 68–72 average.</p>
