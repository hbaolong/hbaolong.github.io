<p>TEASER PREVIEW</p>
<p>What do you call a person who:</p>
<p>• insists on complete and blind obedience?</p>
<p>• toadies to the rich or influential?</p>
<p>• dabbles in the fine arts?</p>
<p>• is a loud-mouthed, quarrelsome woman?</p>
<p>• has a one-track mind?</p>
<p>• sneers at other people’s cherished traditions?</p>
<p>• does not believe in God?</p>
<p>• has imaginary ailments?</p>
<hr />
<p>SESSION 28</p>
<p>There are few of us who do not need warm and nourishing relationships
to lead a fulfilled life.</p>
<p>Psychology makes clear that loving and being loved are important
elements in emotional health, but also points out the necessity for
expressing, rather than repressing, our hostilities. (You know how good
you feel once you blow off steam? And how much closer you can become
attached to someone once you directly and honestly vent your anger,
resentment, or irritation instead of bottling it up and seething in
fury?)</p>
<p>It is a mark of your own emotional maturity if you can accept
hostility as well as dish it out. So let us pretend, in order to
encourage you to become personally involved in the introductory ten
words of this chapter, that each paragraph in the next few pages
accurately describes you. What label exactly fits your personality?</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>slave driver</li>
</ol>
<p>You make everyone toe the mark—right down to the last centimeter. You
exact blind, unquestioning obedience; demand the strictest conformity to
rules, however arbitrary or tyrannical; and will not tolerate the
slightest deviation from your orders. You are, in short, the very
epitome of the army drill sergeant.</p>
<p>You are a martinet.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>bootlicker</li>
</ol>
<p>You toady to rich or influential people, catering to their vanity,
flattering their ego. You are the personification of the traditional
ward heeler, you out-yes the Hollywood yes men. And on top of all these
unpleasant characteristics, you’re a complete hypocrite. All your
servile attentions and unceasing adulation spring from your own selfish
desires to get ahead, not out of any sincere admiration. You cultivate
people of power or property so that you can curry favor at the opportune
moment.</p>
<p>You are a sycophant.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>dabbler</li>
</ol>
<p>Often, though not necessarily, a person of independent income, you
engage superficially in the pursuit of one of the fine arts—painting,
writing, sculpturing, composing, etc. You do this largely for your own
amusement and not to achieve any professional competence; nor are you at
all interested in monetary rewards. Your artistic efforts are simply a
means of passing time pleasantly.</p>
<p>You are a dilettante.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>battle-ax</li>
</ol>
<p>You are a loud-mouthed, shrewish, turbulent woman; you’re quarrelsome
and aggressive, possessing none of those gentle and tender qualities
stereotypically associated with femininity. You’re strong-minded,
unyielding, sharp-tongued, and dangerous. You can curse like a stevedore
and yell like a fishwife—and often do.</p>
<p>You are a virago.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>superpatriot</li>
</ol>
<p>Anything you own or belong to is better—simply because you own it or
belong to it, although you will be quick to find more justifiable
explanations. Your religion, whatever it may be, is far superior to any
other; your political party is the only honest one; your neighborhood
puts all others in the city in the shade; members of your own sex are
more intelligent, more worthy, more emotionally secure, and in every way
far better than people of the opposite sex; your car is faster, more fun
to drive, and gets better gas mileage than any other, no matter in what
price range; and of course your country and its customs leave nothing to
be desired, and inhabitants of other nations are in comparison barely
civilized. In short, you are exaggeratedly, aggressively, absurdly, and
excessively devoted to your own affiliations—and you make no bones about
advertising such prejudice.</p>
<p>You are a chauvinist.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>fanatic</li>
</ol>
<p>You have a one-track mind—and when you’re riding a particular hobby,
you ride it hard. You have such an excessive, all-inclusive zeal for one
thing (and it may be your business, your profession, your husband or
wife, your children, your stomach, your money, or whatever) that your
obsession is almost absurd. You talk, eat, sleep that one thing—to the
point where you bore everyone to distraction.</p>
<p>You are a monomaniac.</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>attacker</li>
</ol>
<p>You are violently against established beliefs, revered traditions,
cherished customs—such, you say, stand in the way of reform and progress
and are always based on superstition and irrationality. Religion,
family, marriage, ethics—you weren’t there when these were started and
you’re not going to conform simply because most unthinking people
do.</p>
<p>You are an iconoclast.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>skeptic</li>
</ol>
<p>There is no God—that’s your position and you’re not going to budge
from it.</p>
<p>You are an atheist.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>self-indulger</li>
</ol>
<p>You are, as a male, lascivious, libidinous, lustful, lewd, wanton,
immoral—but more important, you promiscuously attempt to satisfy (and
are often successful in so doing) your sexual desires with any woman
within your arm’s reach.</p>
<p>You are a lecher.</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>worrier</li>
</ol>
<p>You are always sick, though no doctor can find an organic cause for
your ailments. You know you have ulcers, though medical tests show a
healthy stomach. You have heart palpitations, but a cardiogram fails to
show any abnormality. Your headaches are caused (you’re sure of it) by a
rapidly growing brain tumor—yet X rays show nothing wrong. These
maladies are not imaginary, however; to you they are most real,
non-existent as they may be in fact. And as you travel from doctor to
doctor futilely seeking confirmation of your imminent death, you become
more and more convinced that you’re too weak to go on much longer.
Organically, of course, there’s nothing the matter with you. Perhaps
tensions, insecurities, or a need for attention is taking the form of
simulated bodily ills.</p>
<p>You are a hypochondriac.</p>

<p>SESSION 29</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the French drillmaster</li>
</ol>
<p>Jean Martinet was the Inspector General of Infantry during the reign
of King Louis XIV—and a stricter, more fanatic drillmaster France had
never seen. It was from this time that the French Army’s reputation for
discipline dated, and it is from the name of this Frenchman that we
derive our English word martinet. The word is always used in a
derogatory sense and generally shows resentment and anger on the part of
the user. The secretary who calls his boss a martinet, the wife who
applies the epithet to her husband, the worker who thus refers to the
foreman—these speakers all show their contempt for the excessive,
inhuman discipline to which they are asked to submit.</p>
<p>Since martinet comes from a man’s name (in the Brief Intermission
which follows we shall discover that a number of picturesque English
words are similarly derived), there are no related forms built on the
same root. There is an adjective martinetish (mahr-tƏ-NET′-ish) and
another noun form, martinetism, but these are used only rarely.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>a Greek “fig-shower”</li>
</ol>
<p>Sycophant comes to us from the Greeks. According to Shipley’s
Dictionary of Word Origins:</p>
<p>When a fellow wants to get a good mark, he may polish up an apple and
place it on teacher’s desk; his classmates call such a lad an
apple-shiner. Less complimentary localities use the term bootlicker. The
Greeks had a name for it: fig-shower. Sycophant is from Gr. sykon, fig,
[and] phanein, to show. This was the fellow that informed the officers
in charge when (1) the figs in the sacred groves were being taken, or
(2) when the Smyrna fig-dealers were dodging the tariff.</p>
<p>Thus, a sycophant may appear to be a sort of “stool pigeon,” since
the latter curries the favor of police officials by “peaching” on his
fellow criminals. Sycophants may use this means of ingratiating
themselves with influential citizens of the community; or they may use
flattery, servile attentions, or any other form of insinuating
themselves into someone’s good graces. A sycophant practices sycophancy
(SIK′-Ə-fƏn-see), and has a sycophantic (sik-Ə-FAN′-tik) attitude. All
three forms of the word are highly uncomplimentary—use them with
care.</p>
<p>Material may be so delicate or fine in texture that anything behind
it will show through. The Greek prefix dia- means through; and phanein,
as you now know, means to show—hence such material is called diaphanous
(dī-AF′-Ə-nƏs). Do not use the adjective in reference to all material
that is transparent (for example, you would not call glass diaphanous,
even though you can see right through it), but only material that is
silky, gauzy, filmy, and, in addition, transparent or practically
transparent. The word is often applied to female garments—nightgowns,
negligees, etc.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>just for one’s own amusement</li>
</ol>
<p>Dilettante is from the Italian verb dilettare, to delight. The
dilettante paints, writes, composes, plays a musical instrument, or
engages in scientific experiments purely for amusement—not to make
money, become famous, or satisfy a deep creative urge (the latter, I
presume, being the justifications for the time that professional
artists, writers, composers, musicians, poets, and scientists spend at
their chosen work). A dilettantish (dil-Ə-TAN′-tish) attitude is
superficial, unprofessional; dilettantism (dil-Ə-TAN′-tiz-Əm) is
superficial, part-time dabbling in the type of activity that usually
engages the full time and energy of the professional artist or
scientist.</p>
<p>Do not confuse the dilettante, who has a certain amount of native
talent or ability, with the tyro (TĪ′-rō), who is the inexperienced
beginner in some art, but who may be full of ambition, drive, and
energy. To call a person a tyro is to imply that he is just starting in
some artistic, scientific, or professional field—he’s not much good yet
because he has not had time to develop his skill, if any. The dilettante
usually has some skill but isn’t doing much with it. On the other hand,
anyone who has developed consummate skill in an artistic field,
generally allied to music, is called a virtuoso (vur′-ch-Ō′-sō)—like
Heifetz or Menuhin on the violin, Horowitz or Rubinstein on the piano.
Pluralize virtuoso in the normal way—virtuosos; or if you wish to sound
more sophisticated, give it the continental form—virtuosi
(vur′-ch-Ō′-see). Similarly, the plural of dilettante is either
dilettantes or dilettanti (dil-Ə-TAN′-tee).</p>
<p>The i ending for a plural is the Italian form and is common in
musical circles. For example, libretto, the story (or book) of an opera,
may be pluralized to libretti; concerto, a form of musical composition,
is pluralized concerti. However, the Anglicized librettos and concertos
are perfectly correct also. Libretto is pronounced lƏ-BRET′-ō; libretti
is lƏ-BRET′-ee; concerto is kƏn-CHUR′-tō; and concerti is kƏn-CHUR′-tee.
Suit your plural form, I would suggest, to the sophistication of your
audience.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>“masculine” women</li>
</ol>
<p>Virago comes, oddly enough, from the Latin word for man, vir. Perhaps
the derivation is not so odd after all; a virago, far from being
stereotypically feminine (i.e., timid, delicate, low-spoken, etc.), is
stereotypically masculine in personality—coarse, aggressive,
loud-mouthed. Termagant (TUR′-mƏ-gƏnt) and harridan (HAIR′-Ə-dƏn) are
words with essentially the same uncomplimentary meaning as virago. To
call a brawling woman a virago, a termagant, and a harridan is
admittedly repetitious, but is successful in relieving one’s
feelings.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>the old man</li>
</ol>
<p>Nicolas Chauvin, soldier of the French Empire, so vociferously and
unceasingly aired his veneration of Napoleon Bonaparte that he became
the laughingstock of all Europe. Thereafter, an exaggerated and blatant
patriot was known as a chauvinist—and still is today. Chauvinism
(SHŌ′-vƏ-niz-Əm), by natural extension, applies to blatant veneration
of, or boastfulness about, any other affiliation besides one’s
country.</p>
<p>To be patriotic is to be normally proud of, and devoted to, one’s
country—to be chauvinistic (shō′-vƏ-NIS′-tik) is to exaggerate such
pride and devotion to an obnoxious degree.</p>
<p>We might digress here to investigate an etymological side road down
which the word patriotic beckons. Patriotic is built on the Latin word
pater, patris, father—one’s country is, in a sense, one’s
fatherland.</p>
<p>Let us see what other interesting words are built on this same
root.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>patrimony (PAT′-rƏ-mō-nee)—an inheritance from one’s father. The
-mony comes from the same root that gives us money, namely Juno Moneta,
the Roman goddess who guarded the temples of finance. The adjective is
patrimonial (pat′-rƏ-MŌ′-nee-Əl).</p></li>
<li><p>patronymic (pat′-rƏ-NIM′-ik)—a name formed on the father’s name,
like Johnson (son of John), Martinson, Aaronson, etc. The word combines
pater, patris with Greek onyma, name. Onyma plus the Greek prefix syn-,
with or together, forms synonym (SIN′-Ə-nim), a word of the same name
(or meaning), etymologically “a together name.” Onyma plus the prefix
anti- against, forms antonym (AN′-tƏ-nim), a word of opposite meaning,
etymologically “an against name.” Onyma plus Greek homos, the same,
forms homonym (HOM′-Ə-nim), a word that sounds like another but has a
different meaning and spelling, like bare—bear, way—weigh, to—too—two,
etc., etymologically “a same name.” A homonym is more accurately called
a homophone (HOM′-Ə-fōn′), a combination of homos, the same, and phone,
sound. The adjective form of synonym is synonymous (sƏ-NON′-Ə-mƏs). Can
you write, and pronounce, the adjective derived from:</p></li>
</ol>
<p>antonym? __________________</p>
<p>homonym? __________________</p>
<p>homophone? __________________</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>paternity (pƏ-TUR′-nƏ-tee)—fatherhood, as to question someone’s
paternity, to file a paternity suit in order to collect child support
from the assumed, accused, or self-acknowledged father. The adjective is
paternal (pƏ-TUR′-nƏl), fatherly. Paternalism (pƏ-TUR′-nƏ-liz-Əm) is the
philosophy or system of governing a country, or of managing a business
or institution, so that the citizens, employees, or staff are treated in
a manner suggesting a father-children relationship. (Such a system
sounds, and often is, benign and protective, but plays havoc with the
initiative, independence, and creativity of those in subordinate roles.)
The adjective is paternalistic (pƏ-turn′-Ə-LIS′-tik).</p></li>
<li><p>patriarch (PAY′-tree-ark′)—a venerable, fatherlike old man; an
old man in a ruling, fatherlike position. Here pater, patris is combined
with the Greek root archein, to rule. The adjective is patriarchal
(pay′-tree-AHR′-kƏl), the system is a patriarchy
(PAY′-tree-ahr′-kee).</p></li>
<li><p>patricide (PAT′-rƏ-sīd′)—the killing of one’s father. Pater,
patris combines with -cide, a suffix derived from the Latin verb caedo,
to kill. The adjective is patricidal (pat-rƏ-SĪ′-dƏl).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This list does not exhaust the number of words built on pater,
father, but is sufficient to give you an idea of how closely related
many English words are. In your reading you will come across other words
containing the letters pater or patr—you will be able to figure them out
once you realize that the base is the word father. You might, if you
feel ambitious, puzzle out the relationship to the “father idea” in the
following words, checking with a dictionary to see how good your
linguistic intuition is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>patrician</p></li>
<li><p>patron</p></li>
<li><p>patronize</p></li>
<li><p>patronizing (adj.)</p></li>
<li><p>paterfamilias</p></li>
<li><p>padre</p></li>
<li><p>the old lady</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Pater, patris is father. Mater, matris is mother.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>matriarch (MAY′-tree-ahrk′)—the mother-ruler; the “mother person”
that controls a large household, tribe, or country. This word, like
patriarch, is built on the root archein, to rule. During the reign of
Queen Elizabeth or Queen Victoria, England was a matriarchy
(MAY′-tree-ahr′-kee). Can you figure out the adjective form?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>maternity (mƏ-TUR′-nƏ-tee)—motherhood</p></li>
<li><p>maternal (mƏ-TURN′-Əl)—motherly</p></li>
<li><p>matron (MAY′-trƏn)—an older woman, one sufficiently mature to be
a mother. The adjective matronly (MAY′-trƏn-lee) conjures up for many
people a picture of a woman no longer in the glow of youth and possibly
with a bit of added weight in the wrong places, so this word should be
used with caution; it may be hazardous to your health if the lady you
are so describing is of a tempestous nature, or is a virago.</p></li>
<li><p>alma mater (AL′-mƏ MAY′-tƏr or AHL′-mƏ MAH′-tƏr)—etymologically,
“soul mother”; actually, the school or college from which one has
graduated, and which in a sense is one’s intellectual mother.</p></li>
<li><p>matrimony (MAT′-rƏ-mō′-nee)—marriage. Though this word is similar
to patrimony in spelling, it does not refer to money, as patrimony does;
unless, that is, you are cynical enough to believe that people marry for
money. As the language was growing, marriage and children went hand in
hand—it is therefore not surprising that the word for marriage should be
built on the Latin root for mother. Of course, times have changed, but
the sexist nature of the English language has not. The noun suffix -mony
indicates state, condition, or result, as in sanctimony, parsimony, etc.
The adjective is matrimonial (mat′-rƏ-MŌ′-nee-Əl).</p></li>
<li><p>matricide (MAT′-rƏ-sīd′)—the killing of one’s mother. The
adjective? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>murder most foul…</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Murder unfortunately is an integral part of human life, so there is a
word for almost every kind of killing you can think of. Let’s look at
some of them.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>suicide (S′-Ə-sīd′)—killing oneself (intentionally); -cide plus
sui, of oneself. This is both the act and the person who has been
completely successful in performing the act (partially doesn’t count);
also, in colloquial usage, suicide is a verb. The adjective?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>fratricide (FRAT′-rƏ-sīd′)—the killing of one’s brother; -cide
plus frater, fratris, brother. The adjective?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>sororicide (sƏ-RAWR′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s sister; -cide
plus soror, sister. The adjective? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>homicide (HOM′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of a human being; -cide plus
homo, person. In law, homicide is the general term for any slaying. If
intent and premeditation can be proved, the act is murder and punishable
as such. If no such intent is present, the act is called manslaughter
and receives a lighter punishment. Thus, if your mate/lover/spouse makes
your life unbearable and you slip some arsenic into his/her coffee one
bright morning, you are committing murder—that is, if he/she succumbs.
On the other hand, if you run your victim down—quite accidentally—with
your car, bicycle, or wheelchair, with no intent to kill, you will be
accused of manslaughter—that is, if death results and if you can prove
you didn’t really mean it. It’s all rather delicate, however, and you
might do best to put thoughts of justifiable homicide out of your mind.
The adjective? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>regicide (REJ′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s king, president, or
other governing official. Booth committed regicide when he assassinated
Abraham Lincoln. Adjective? __________________. Derivation: Latin rex,
regis, king, plus -cide.</p></li>
<li><p>uxoricide (uk-SAWR′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s wife. Adjective?
__________________. Derivation: Latin uxor, wife, plus -cide.</p></li>
<li><p>mariticide (mƏ-RIT′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of one’s husband.
Adjective? __________________. Derivation: Latin maritus, husband, plus
-cide.</p></li>
<li><p>infanticide (in-FAN′-tƏ-sīd′)—the killing of a newborn child.
Adjective? __________________. Derivation: Latin infans, infantis, baby,
plus -cide.</p></li>
<li><p>genocide (JEN′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of a whole race or nation.
This is a comparatively new word, coined in 1944 by a UN official named
Raphael Lemkin, to refer to the mass murder of the Jews, Poles, etc.
ordered by Hitler. Adjective? __________________. Derivation: Greek
genos, race, kind, plus -cide.</p></li>
<li><p>parricide (PAIR′-Ə-sīd′)—the killing of either or both parents.
Adjective? __________________.</p></li>

<p>Lizzie Borden was accused of, and tried for, parricide in the 1890s,
but was not convicted. A bit of doggerel that was popular at the time,
and, so I have been told, little girls jumped rope to, went somewhat as
follows:</p>
<p>Lizzie Borden took an ax</p>
<p>And gave her mother forty whacks—</p>
<p>And when she saw what she had done,</p>
<p>She gave her father forty-one.</p>

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>brothers and sisters, wives and husbands</li>
</ol>
<p>Frater, brother; soror, sister; uxor, wife; and maritus,
husband—these roots are the source of a number of additional English
words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>to fraternize (FRAT′-Ər-nīz′)—etymologically, to have a brotherly
relationship (with). This verb may be used to indicate social
intercourse between people, irrespective of sex, as in, “Members of the
faculty often fraternized after school hours.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, and perhaps more commonly, there may be the implication
of having a social relationship with one’s subordinates in an
organization, or even with one’s so-called inferiors, as in, “The
president of the college was reluctant to fraternize with faculty
members, preferring to keep all her contacts with them on an exclusively
professional basis”; or as in, “The artist enjoyed fraternizing with
thieves, drug addicts, prostitutes, and pimps, partly out of social
perversity, partly to find interesting faces to put in his
paintings.”</p>
<p>The verb also gained a new meaning during and after World War II,
when soldiers of occupying armies had sexual relations with the women of
conquered countries, as in, “Military personnel were strictly forbidden
to fraternize with the enemy.” (How euphemistic can you get?)</p>
<p>Can you write the noun form of fraternize? __________________.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>fraternal (frƏ-TUR′-nƏl)—brotherly. The word also designates
non-identical (twins).</p></li>
<li><p>fraternity (frƏ-TUR′-nƏ-tee)—a men’s organization in a high
school or college, often labeled with Greek letters (the Gamma Delta
Epsilon Fraternity); or any group of people of similar interests or
profession (the medical fraternity, the financial fraternity).</p></li>
<li><p>sorority (sƏ-RAWR′-Ə-tee)—a women’s organization in high school
or college, again usually Greek-lettered; or any women’s social
club.</p></li>
<li><p>uxorious (uk-SAWR′-ee-Əs)—an adjective describing a man who
excessively, even absurdly, caters to, dotes on, worships, and submits
to the most outlandish or outrageous demands of, his wife. This word is
not synonymous with henpecked, as the henpecked husband is dominated by
his wife, perhaps because of his own fear or weakness, while the
uxorious husband is dominated only by his neurosis, and quite likely the
wife finds his uxoriousness (uk-SAWR′-ee-Əs-nƏs) comical or a pain in
the neck. (There can, indeed, be too much of a good thing!)</p></li>
<li><p>uxorial—pertaining to, characteristic of, or befitting, a wife,
as uxorial duties, privileges, attitudes, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>marital (MAIR′-Ə-tƏl)—etymologically, pertaining or referring to,
or characteristic of, a husband; but the meaning has changed to include
the marriage relationship of both husband and wife (don’t ever let
anyone tell you that our language is not sexist!), as marital duties,
obligations, privileges, arguments, etc. Hence extramarital is literally
outside the marriage, as in extramarital affairs (hanky-panky with
someone other than one’s spouse). And premarital (Latin prefix pre-,
before) describes events that occur before a planned marriage, as
premarital sex, a premarital agreement as to the division of property,
etc.</p></li>
<li><p>of cabbages and kings (without the cabbage)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Rex, regis is Latin for king. Tyrannosaurus rex was the king (i.e.,
the largest) of the dinosaurs (etymologically, “king of the tyrant
lizards”). Dogs are often named Rex to fool them into thinking they are
kings rather than slaves. And regal (REE′-gƏl) is royal, or fit for a
king, hence magnificent, stately, imperious, splendid, etc., as in regal
bearing or manner, a regal mansion, a regal reception, etc. The noun is
regality (rƏ-GAL′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>Regalia (rƏ-GAYL′-yƏ), a plural noun, designated the emblems or
insignia or dress of a king, and now refers to any impressively formal
clothes; or, more commonly, to the decorations, insignia, or uniform of
a rank, position, office, social club, etc. “The Shriners were dressed
in full regalia,” “The five-star general appeared in full regalia,”
etc.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>“madness” of all sorts</li>
</ol>
<p>The monomaniac develops an abnormal obsession in respect to one
particular thing (Greek monos, one), but is otherwise normal. The
obsession itself, or the obsessiveness, is monomania
(mon′-Ə-MAY′-nee-Ə), the adjective is monomaniacal
(mon′-Ə-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl). Monomaniacal, like the adjective forms of various
other manias, is tricky to pronounce—practice carefully to make sure you
can say it correctly without stuttering.</p>
<p>Psychology recognizes other abnormal states, all designating
obsessions, and built on Greek mania, madness.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>dipsomania (dip′-sƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid compulsion to keep on
absorbing alcoholic beverages (Greek dipsa, thirst). The dipsomaniac has
been defined as the person for whom one drink is too many, a thousand
not enough. Recent investigations suggest that dipsomania, or
alcoholism, may not necessarily be caused by anxieties or frustrations,
but possibly by a metabolic or physiological disorder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Adjective: dipsomaniacal (dip′-sƏ-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>kleptomania (klep′-tƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid compulsion to steal, not
from any economic motive, but simply because the urge to take another’s
possessions is irresistible. The kleptomaniac (Greek klepte, thief) may
be wealthy, and yet be an obsessive shoplifter. The kleptomaniac, for
reasons that psychologists are still arguing about, is more often a
female than a male, and may pinch her best friend’s valueless trinket,
or a cheap ashtray or salt shaker from a restaurant, not because she
wants, let alone needs, the article, but because she apparently can’t
help herself; she gets carried away. (When she arrives home, she may
toss it in a drawer with other loot, and never look at it again.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you write (and correctly pronounce) the adjective?</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>pyromania (pī′-rƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid compulsion to set fires.
Pyromania should not be confused with incendiarism
(in-SEN′-dee-Ə-riz-Əm), which is the malicious and deliberate burning of
another’s property, and is not a compulsive need to see the flames and
enjoy the thrill of the heat and the smoke. Some pyromaniacs join
volunteer fire companies, often heroically putting out the very blazes
they themselves have set. An incendiary (in-SEN′-dee-air-ee) is
antisocial, and usually sets fires for revenge. Either of these two
dangerous characters is called, colloquially, a “firebug.”</li>
</ol>
<p>In law, setting fire to another’s, or to one’s own, property for the
purpose of economic gain (such as the collection of the proceeds of an
insurance policy) is called arson (AHR′-sƏn) and is a felony. The
pyromaniac sets fire for the thrill; the incendiary for revenge; the
arsonist (AHR′-sƏ-nist) for money.</p>
<p>Pyromania is built on Greek pyros, fire; incendiarism on Latin
incendo, incensus, to set fire; arson on Latin ardo, arsus, to burn.</p>
<p>Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective form of pyromaniac?

<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>megalomania (meg′-Ə-lƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid delusions of grandeur,
power, importance, godliness, etc. Jokes accusing the heads of
governments of megalomania are common. Here’s an old chestnut from the
forties:</li>
</ol>
<p>Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin were talking about their dreams.</p>
<p>Churchill: I dreamed last night that God had made me Prime Minister
of the whole world.</p>
<p>Roosevelt: I dreamed that God had made me President of the whole
world.</p>
<p>Stalin: How could you gentlemen have such dreams? I didn’t dream of
offering you those positions!</p>
<p>Hitler, Napoleon, and Alexander the Great have been called
megalomaniacs—all three certainly had delusions about their
invincibility.</p>
<p>Can you write (and pronounce correctly!) the adjective derived from
megalomaniac? __________________.</p>
<p>Megalomania is built on Greek megas, great, big, large, plus
mania.</p>
<p>[Can you think of the word for what someone speaks through to make
the sound (phone) of his voice greater? __________________.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>nymphomania (nim′-fƏ-MAY′-nee-Ə)—morbid, incessant, uncontrollable,
and intense desire, on the part of a female, for sexual intercourse
(from Greek nymphe, bride, plus mania).</li>
</ol>
<p>The person? __________________.</p>
<p>The adjective? __________________.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>satyromania (sƏ-teer′-Ə-MAY′-nee-Ə)—the same morbid, incessant, etc.
desire on the part of a male (from Greek satyros, satyr, plus
mania).</li>
</ol>
<p>The person? __________________.</p>
<p>The adjective? __________________.</p>
<p>A satyr (SAY′-tƏr) was a mythological Greek god, notorious for
lechery. He had horns, pointed ears, and the legs of a goat; the rest of
him was in human form. Satyromania is also called satyriasis
(sat′-Ə-RĪ′-Ə-sis).</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>and now phobias</li>
</ol>
<p>So much for maniacs. There is another side to the coin. Just as
personality disorders can cause morbid attraction toward certain things
or acts (stealing, fire, power, sex, etc.), so also other emotional ills
can cause violent or morbid repulsions to certain conditions, things, or
situations. There are people who have irrational and deep-seated dread
of cats, dogs, fire, the number thirteen, snakes, thunder or lightning,
various colors, and so on almost without end:1 Such morbid dread or fear
is called, in the language of psychology, a phobia, and we might pause
to investigate the three most common ones. These are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>claustrophobia (klaw′-strƏ-FŌ′-bee-Ə)—morbid dread of being
physically hemmed in, of enclosed spaces, of crowds, etc. From Latin
claustrum, enclosed place, plus Greek phobia, morbid fear. The person:
claustrophobe (KLAW′-strƏ-fōb′). Adjective: claustrophobic
(klaw′-strƏ-FŌ′-bik).</p></li>
<li><p>agoraphobia (ag′-Ə-rƏ-FŌ′-bee-Ə)—morbid dread of open space, the
reverse of claustrophobia. People suffering from agoraphobia prefer to
stay shut in their homes as much as possible, and become panic-stricken
in such places as open fields, large public buildings, airport
terminals, etc. From Greek agora, market place, plus phobia.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The person? __________________.</p>
<p>The adjective? __________________.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>acrophobia (ak′-rƏ-FŌ′-bee-Ə)—morbid dread of high places. The
victims of this fear will not climb ladders or trees, or stand on tops
of furniture. They refuse to go onto the roof of a building or look out
the window of one of the higher floors. From Greek akros, highest, plus
phobia.</li>

<p>SESSION 31</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>no reverence</li>
</ol>
<p>The iconoclast sneers at convention and tradition, attempts to expose
our cherished beliefs, our revered traditions, or our stereotypical
thinking as shams and myths. H. L. Mencken was the great iconoclast of
the 1920s; Tom Wolfe (The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline
Baby), of the 1960s.</p>
<p>Adolescence is that confused and rebellious time of life in which
iconoclasm (ī-KON′-Ə-klaz′-Əm) is quite normal—indeed the adolescent who
is not iconoclastic (ī-kon′-Ə-KLAST′-ik) to some degree might be
considered either immature or maladjusted. The words are from eikon, a
religious image, plus klaein, to break. Iconoclasm is not of course
restricted to religion.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>is there a God?</li>
</ol>
<p>Atheist combines the Greek negative prefix a- with theos, God. Do not
confuse atheism (AY′-thee-iz-Əm) with agnosticism (ag-NOS′-tƏ-siz-Əm),
the philosophy that claims that God is unknowable, that He may or may
not exist, and that human beings can never come to a final conclusion
about Him. The agnostic (ag-NOS′-tik) does not deny the existence of a
deity, as does the atheist, but simply holds that no proof can be
adduced one way or the other.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>how to know</li>
</ol>
<p>Agnostic (which is also an adjective) is built on the Greek root
gnostos, known, and the negative prefix a-. An agnostic claims that all
but material phenomena is unknown, and, indeed, unknowable.</p>
<p>A diagnosis (dī-Əg-NŌ′-sis), constructed on the allied Greek root
gnosis, knowledge, plus dia-, through, is a knowing through examination
or testing. A prognosis (prog-NŌ′-sis), on the other hand, is
etymologically a knowing beforehand, hence a prediction, generally, but
not solely, as to the course of a disease. (The Greek prefix pro-,
before, plus gnosis.)</p>
<p>Thus, you may say to a doctor: “What’s the diagnosis, Doc?”</p>
<p>“Diabetes.”</p>
<p>Then you say, “And what’s the prognosis?”</p>
<p>“If you take insulin and watch your diet, you’ll soon be as good as
new.”</p>
<p>The doctor’s prognosis, then, is a forecast of the development or
trend of a disease. The doctor knows beforehand, from previous similar
cases, what to expect.</p>
<p>The verb form of diagnosis is diagnose (dī′-Əg-NŌS′); the verb form
of prognosis is prognosticate (prog-NOS′-tƏ-kayt′). To use the verb
prognosticate correctly, be sure that your meaning involves the
forecasting of developments from a consideration of symptoms or
conditions—whether the problem is physical, mental, political, economic,
psychological, or what have you.</p>
<p>In school, you doubtless recall taking diagnostic (dī′-Əg-NOS′-tik)
tests; these measured not what you were supposed to have learned during
the semester, but your general knowledge in a field, so that your
teachers would know what remedial steps to take, just as doctors rely on
their diagnosis to decide what drugs or treatments to prescribe.</p>
<p>In a reading center, various diagnostic machines and tests are
used—these tell the clinician what is wrong with a student’s reading and
what measures will probably increase such a student’s reading
efficiency.</p>
<p>The medical specialist in diagnosis is a diagnostician
(dī′-Əg-nos-TISH′-Ən).</p>
<p>The noun form of the verb prognosticate is prognostication
(prog-nos′-tƏ-KAY′-shƏn).</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>getting back to God</li>
</ol>
<p>Theos, God, is also found in:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Monotheism (MON′-Ə-thee-iz-Əm)—belief in one God. (Monos, one, plus
theos, God.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Using atheism, atheist, and atheistic as a model, write the word for
the person who believes in one God: __________________. The adjective?
__________________.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Polytheism (POL′-ee-thee-iz-Əm)—belief in many gods, as in ancient
Greece or Rome. (Polys, many, plus theos.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The person with such a belief? __________________. The adjective?
__________________.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>Pantheism (PAN′-thee-iz-Əm)—belief that God is not in man’s
image, but is a combination of all forces of the universe. (Pan, all,
plus theos,) The person? __________________. The adjective?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Theology (thee-OL′-Ə-jee)—the study of God and religion. (Theos
plus logos, science or study.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The student is a theologian (thee′-Ə-LŌ′-jƏn), the adjective is
theological (thee′-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>of sex and the tongue</li>
</ol>
<p>A lecher practices lechery (LECH′-Ər-ee). The derivation is Old
French lechier, to lick. The adjective lecherous (LECH′-Ə-rƏs) has many
close or not-so-close synonyms, most of them also, and significantly,
starting with the letter l, a sound formed with the tongue, supposedly
the seat of sensation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>libidinous (lƏ-BID′-Ə-nƏs)—from libido, pleasure.</p></li>
<li><p>lascivious (lƏ-SIV′-ee-Əs)—from lascivia, wantonness.</p></li>
<li><p>lubricious (l-BRISH′-Əs)—from lubricus, slippery, the same root
found in lubricate. The noun is lubricity (l-BRIS′-Ə-tee).</p></li>
<li><p>licentious (lī-SEN′-shƏs)—from licere, to be permitted, the root
from which we get license, etymologically, “permission,” and illicit,
etymologically, “not permitted.”</p></li>
<li><p>lewd—the previous four words derive from Latin, but this one is
from Anglo-Saxon lewed, vile.</p></li>
<li><p>lustful—from an Anglo-Saxon word meaning pleasure, desire. Noun:
lust.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Libidinous, lascivious, lubricious, licentious, lewd, lecherous,
lustful are seven adjectives that indicate sexual desire and/or
activity. The implication of all seven words is more or less
derogatory.</p>
<p>Each adjective becomes a noun with the addition of the noun suffix
-ness; lubricity and lust are alternate noun forms of two of the
adjectives.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>of sex and the itch</li>
</ol>
<p>Prurient (PR′-ee-Ənt), from Latin prurio, to itch, to long for,
describes someone who is filled with great sexual curiosity, desire,
longing, etc. Can you form the noun? __________________.</p>
<p>Pruritis (prr-Ī′-tis), from the same root, is a medical condition in
which the skin is very itchy, but without a rash or eruptions. (Scratch
enough, of course, as you will be irresistibly tempted to do, and
something like a rash will soon appear.) The adjective is pruritic
(prr-IT′-ik).</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>under and over</li>
</ol>
<p>Hypochondria (hī-pƏ-KON′-dree-Ə) is built on two Greek roots: hypos,
under, and chondros, the cartilage of the breastbone. This may sound
farfetched until you realize that under the breastbone is the abdomen;
the ancient Greeks believed that morbid anxiety about one’s health arose
in the abdomen—and no one is more morbidly, unceasingly, and unhappily
anxious about health than the hypochondriac.</p>
<p>Hypochondriac is also an adjective—an alternate and more commonly
used adjective form is hypochondriacal (hī′-pƏ-kƏn-DRĪ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<p>Hypos, under, is a useful root to know. The hypodermic needle
penetrates under the skin; a hypothyroid person has an underworking
thyroid gland; hypotension is abnormally low blood pressure.</p>
<p>On the other hand, hyper is the Greek root meaning over. The
hypercritical person is excessively fault-finding; hyperthyroidism is an
overworking of the thyroid gland; hypertension is high blood pressure;
and you can easily figure out the meanings of hyperacidity, hyperactive,
hypersensitive, etc.</p>
<p>The adjective forms of hypotension and hypertension are hypotensive
and hypertensive.</p>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18)</p>
<p>MAGAZINES THAT WILL HELP YOU</p>
<p>When a pregnant woman takes calcium pills, she must make sure also
that her diet is rich in vitamin D, since this vitamin makes the
absorption of the calcium possible. In building your vocabulary by
learning great quantities of new words, you too must take a certain
vitamin, metaphorically speaking, to help you absorb, understand, and
remember these words. This vitamin is reading—for it is in books and
magazines that you will find the words that we have been discussing in
these pages. To learn new words without seeing them applied in the
context of your reading is to do only half the job and to run the risk
of gradually forgetting the additions to your vocabulary. To combine
your vocabulary-building with increased reading is to make assurance
doubly sure.</p>
<p>You are now so alert to the words and roots we have discussed that
you will find that most of your reading will be full of the new words
you have learned—and every time you do see one of the words used in
context in a book or magazine, you will understand it more fully and
will be taking long steps toward using it yourself.</p>
<p>Among magazines, I would like particularly to recommend the
following, which will act both to keep you mentally alert and to set the
new words you are learning:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Harper’s Magazine</p></li>
<li><p>Atlantic Monthly</p></li>
<li><p>The New Yorker</p></li>
<li><p>Time</p></li>
<li><p>Newsweek</p></li>
<li><p>Esquire</p></li>
<li><p>Psychology Today</p></li>
<li><p>Saturday Review</p></li>
<li><p>Ms.</p></li>
<li><p>Mother Jones</p></li>
<li><p>Signs</p></li>
<li><p>National Geographic</p></li>
<li><p>Smithsonian</p></li>
<li><p>Human Nature</p></li>
<li><p>Scientific American</p></li>
<li><p>Natural History</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These periodicals are aimed at the alert, verbally sophisticated,
educated reader; you will see in them, without fail, most of the words
you have been studying in this book—not to mention hosts of other
valuable words you will want to add to your vocabulary, many of which
you will be able to figure out once you recognize their etymological
structure.</p>
<p>(End of Session 31)</p>

<p>1 For some of these esoteric phobias, see Appendix.</p>
<p>Brief Intermission Seven</p>
<p>SOME INTERESTING DERIVATIONS</p>
<p>PEOPLE WHO MADE OUR LANGUAGE</p>
<p>Bloomers</p>
<p>Mrs. Elizabeth Smith Miller invented them in 1849, and showed a
working model to a famous women’s rights advocate, Amelia J. Bloomer.
Amelia was fascinated by the idea of garments that were both modest
(they then reached right down to the ankles) and convenient—and promptly
sponsored them.…</p>
<p>Boycott</p>
<p>Charles C. Boycott was an English land agent whose difficult duty it
was to collect high rents from Irish farmers. In protest, the farmers
ostracized him, not even allowing him to make purchases in town or hire
workers to harvest his crops.</p>
<p>Marcel</p>
<p>Marcel was an ingenious Parisian hairdresser who felt he could
improve on the button curls popular in 1875. He did, and made a
fortune.</p>
<p>Silhouette</p>
<p>Finance Minister of France just before the Revolution, Etienne de
Silhouette advocated the simple life, so that excess money could go into
the treasury instead of into luxurious living. And the profile is the
simplest form of portraiture, if you get the connection.</p>
<p>Derrick</p>
<p>A seventeenth-century English hangman, Derrick by name, hoisted to
their death some of the most notorious criminals of the day.</p>
<p>Sadist</p>
<p>Because Count de Sade, an eighteenth-century Frenchman, found his
greatest delight in torturing friends and mistresses, the term sadist
was derived from his name. His works shocked his nation and the world by
the alarming frankness with which he described his morbid and
bloodthirsty cruelty.</p>
<p>Galvanism</p>
<p>Luigi Galvani, the Italian physiologist, found by accident that an
electrically charged scalpel could send a frog’s corpse into muscular
convulsions. Experimenting further, he eventually discovered the
principles of chemically produced electricity. His name is responsible
not only for the technical expressions galvanism, galvanized iron, and
galvanometer, but also for that highly graphic phrase, “galvanized into
action.”</p>
<p>Guppies</p>
<p>In 1868, R. J. Lechmere Guppy, president of the Scientific
Association of Trinidad, sent some specimens of a tiny tropical fish to
the British Museum. Ever since, fish of this species have been called
guppies.</p>
<p>Nicotine</p>
<p>Four hundred years ago, Jean Nicot, a French ambassador, bought some
tobacco seeds from a Flemish trader. Nicot’s successful efforts to
popularize the plant in Europe brought him linguistic immortality.</p>
<p>PLACES THAT MADE OUR LANGUAGE</p>
<p>Bayonne, France</p>
<p>Where first was manufactured the daggerlike weapon that fits over the
muzzle end of a rifle—the bayonet.</p>
<p>Cantalupo, Italy</p>
<p>The first place in Europe to grow those luscious melons we now call
cantaloupes.</p>
<p>Calicut, India</p>
<p>The city from which we first imported a kind of cotton cloth now
known as calico.</p>
<p>Tuxedo Park, New York</p>
<p>In the country club of this exclusive and wealthy community, the
short (no tails) dinner coat for men, or tuxedo, was popularized.</p>
<p>Egypt</p>
<p>It was once supposed that the colorful, fortunetelling wanderers, or
Gypsies, hailed from this ancient land.</p>
<p>Damascus, Syria</p>
<p>Where an elaborately patterned silk, damask, was first made.</p>
<p>Tzu-t’ing, China</p>
<p>Once a great seaport in Fukien Province. Marco Polo called it Zaitun,
and in time a silk fabric made there was called satin.</p>
<p>Frankfurt, Germany</p>
<p>Where the burghers once greatly enjoyed their smoked beef and pork
sausages, which we now ask for in delicatessen stores and supermarkets
by the name of frankfurters, franks, or hot dogs.</p>
