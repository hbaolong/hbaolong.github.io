<p>SESSION 7</p>
<p>An ancient Greek mused about the meaning of life, and philosophy was
born. The first Roman decided to build a road instead of cutting a path
through the jungle, and engineering came into existence. One day in
primitive times, a human being lent to another whatever then passed for
money and got back his original investment plus a little more—and
banking had started.</p>
<p>Most people spend part of every workday at some gainful employment,
honest or otherwise, and in so doing often contribute their little mite
to the progress of the world.</p>
<p>We explore in this chapter the ideas behind people’s occupations—and
the words that translate these ideas into verbal symbols.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>behavior</li>
</ol>
<p>By education and training, this practitioner is an expert in the dark
mysteries of human behavior—what makes people act as they do, why they
have certain feelings, how their personalities were formed—in short,
what makes them tick. Such a professional is often employed by
industries, schools, and institutions to devise means for keeping
workers productive and happy, students well-adjusted, and inmates
contented. With a state license, this person may also do private or
group therapy.</p>
<p>A psychologist</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>worries, fears, conflicts</li>
</ol>
<p>This practitioner is a physician, psychiatrist, or psychologist who
has been specially trained in the techniques devised by Sigmund Freud,
encouraging you to delve into that part of your mind called “the
unconscious.” By reviewing the experiences, traumas, feelings, and
thoughts of your earlier years, you come to a better understanding of
your present worries, fears, conflicts, repressions, insecurities, and
nervous tensions—thus taking the first step in coping with them.
Treatment, consisting largely in listening to, and helping you to
interpret the meaning of, your free-flowing ideas, is usually given in
frequent sessions that may well go on for a year or more.</p>
<p>A psychoanalyst</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>teeth</li>
</ol>
<p>This practitioner is a dentist who has taken postgraduate work in the
straightening of teeth.</p>
<p>An orthodontist</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>eyes</li>
</ol>
<p>This practitioner measures your vision and prescribes the type of
glasses that will give you a new and more accurate view of the
world.</p>
<p>An optometrist</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>glasses</li>
</ol>
<p>This practitioner grinds lenses according to the specifications
prescribed by your optometrist or ophthalmologist, and may also deal in
other kinds of optical goods.</p>
<p>An optician</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>bones and blood vessels</li>
</ol>
<p>This practitioner is a member of the profession that originated in
1874, when Andrew T. Still devised a drugless technique of curing
diseases by massage and other manipulative procedures, a technique based
on the theory that illness may be caused by the undue pressure of
displaced bones on nerves and blood vessels.</p>
<p>Training is equal to that of physicians, and in most states these
practitioners may also use the same methods as, and have the full rights
and privileges of, medical doctors.</p>
<p>An osteopath</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>joints and articulations</li>
</ol>
<p>The basic principle of this practitioner’s work is the maintenance of
the structural and functional integrity of the nervous system. Treatment
consists of manipulating most of the articulations of the body,
especially those connected to the spinal column. Licensed and legally
recognized in forty-five states, this professional has pursued academic
studies and training that parallel those of the major healing
professions.</p>
<p>A chiropractor</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>feet</li>
</ol>
<p>This practitioner treats minor foot ailments—corns, calluses,
bunions, fallen arches, etc., and may perform minor surgery.</p>
<p>A podiatrist</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>writing</li>
</ol>
<p>This practitioner analyzes handwriting to determine character,
personality, or aptitudes, and is often called upon to verify the
authenticity of signatures, written documents, etc.</p>
<p>A graphologist</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>getting old</li>
</ol>
<p>This social scientist deals with the financial, economic, sexual,
social, retirement, and other non-medical problems of the elderly.</p>
<p>A gerontologist</p>

<p>SESSION 8</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the mental life</li>
</ol>
<p>Psychologist is built upon the same Greek root as
psychiatrist—psyche, spirit, soul, or mind. In psychiatrist, the
combining form is iatreia, medical healing. In psychologist, the
combining form is logos, science or study; a psychologist, by etymology,
is one who studies the mind.</p>
<p>The field is psychology (sī-KOL′-Ə-jee), the adjective psychological
(sī′-kƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<p>Psyche (SĪ′-kee) is also an English word in its own right—it
designates the mental life, the spiritual or non-physical aspect of
one’s existence. The adjective psychic (SĪ′-kik) refers to phenomena or
qualities that cannot be explained in purely physical terms. People may
be called psychic if they seem to possess a sixth sense, a special gift
of mind reading, or any mysterious aptitudes that cannot be accounted
for logically. A person’s disturbance is psychic if it is emotional or
mental, rather than physical.</p>
<p>Psyche combines with the Greek pathos, suffering or disease, to form
psychopathic (sī-kƏ-PATH′-ik), an adjective that describes someone
suffering from a severe mental or emotional disorder. The noun is
psychopathy (sī′-KOP′-Ə-thee).1</p>
<p>The root psyche combines with Greek soma, body, to form psychosomatic
(sī′-kō-sƏ-MAT′-ik), an adjective that delineates the powerful influence
that the mind, especially the unconscious, has on bodily diseases. Thus,
a person who fears the consequence of being present at a certain meeting
will suddenly develop a bad cold or backache, or even be injured in a
traffic accident, so that his appearance at this meeting is made
impossible. It’s a real cold, it’s far from an imaginary backache, and
of course one cannot in any sense doubt the reality of the automobile
that injured him. Yet, according to the psychosomatic theory of
medicine, his unconscious made him susceptible to the cold germs, caused
the backache, or forced him into the path of the car.</p>
<p>A psychosomatic disorder actually exists insofar as symptoms are
concerned (headache, excessive urination, pains, paralysis, heart
palpitations), yet there is no organic cause within the body. The cause
is within the psyche, the mind. Dr. Flanders Dunbar, in Mind and Body,
gives a clear and exciting account of the interrelationship between
emotions and diseases.</p>
<p>Psychoanalysis (sī′-kō-Ə-NAL′-Ə-sis) relies on the technique of
deeply, exhaustively probing into the unconscious, a technique developed
by Sigmund Freud. In oversimplified terms, the general principle of
psychoanalysis is to guide the patient to an awareness of the
deep-seated, unconscious causes of anxieties, fears, conflicts, and
tension. Once found, exposed to the light of day, and thoroughly
understood, claim the psychoanalysts, these causes may vanish like a
light snow that is exposed to strong sunlight.</p>
<p>Consider an example: You have asthma, let us say, and your doctor can
find no physical basis for your ailment. So you are referred to a
psychoanalyst (or psychiatrist or clinical psychologist who practices
psychoanalytically oriented therapy).</p>
<p>With your therapist you explore your past life, dig into your
unconscious, and discover, let us say for the sake of argument, that
your mother or father always used to set for you impossibly high goals.
No matter what you accomplished in school, it was not good enough—in
your mother’s or father’s opinion (and such opinions were always made
painfully clear to you), you could do better if you were not so lazy. As
a child you built up certain resentments and anxieties because you
seemed unable to please your parent—and (this will sound farfetched, but
it is perfectly possible) as a result you became asthmatic. How else
were you going to get the parental love, the approbation, the attention
you needed and that you felt you were not receiving?</p>
<p>In your sessions with your therapist, you discover that your asthma
is emotionally, rather than organically, based—your ailment is
psychogenic (sī′-kō-JEN′-ik), of psychic origin, or (the terms are used
more or less interchangeably although they differ somewhat in
definition) psychosomatic, resulting from the interaction of mind and
body. (Psychogenic is built on psyche plus Greek genesis, birth or
origin.)</p>
<p>And your treatment? No drugs, no surgery—these may help the body, not
the emotions. Instead, you “work out” (this is the term used in
psychoanalytic [sī-kō-an′-Ə-LIT′-ik] parlance) early trauma in talk, in
remembering, in exploring, in interpreting, in reliving childhood
experiences. And if your asthma is indeed psychogenic (or
psychosomatic), therapy will very likely help you; your attacks may
cease, either gradually or suddenly.</p>
<p>Freudian therapy is less popular today than formerly; many newer
therapies—Gestalt, bioenergetics, transactional analysis, to name only a
few—claim to produce quicker results.</p>
<p>In any case, psychotherapy (sī-kō-THAIR′-Ə-pee) of one sort or
another is the indicated treatment for psychogenic (or psychosomatic)
disorders, or for any personality disturbances. The practitioner is a
psychotherapist (sī-kō-THAIR′-Ə-pist) or therapist, for short; the
adjective is psychotherapeutic (sī-kō-thair′-Ə-PY′-tik).</p>

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the whole tooth</li>
</ol>
<p>Orthodontist, as we discovered in Chapter 4, is built on orthos,
straight, correct, plus odontos, tooth.</p>
<p>A pedodontist (pee′-dō-DON′-tist) specializes in the care of
children’s teeth—the title is constructed from paidos, child, plus
odontos. The specialty: pedodontia (pee′-dō-DON′-sha); the adjective:
pedodontic (pee′-dō-DON′-tik).</p>
<p>A periodontist (pair′-ee-ō-DON′-tist) is a gum specialist—the term
combines odontos with the prefix peri-, around, surrounding. (As a quick
glance in the mirror will tell you, the gums surround the teeth, more or
less.)</p>
<p>Can you figure out the word for the specialty? __________________</p>
<p>For the adjective? __________________</p>
<p>An endodontist (en′-dō-DON′-tist) specializes in work on the pulp of
the tooth and in root-canal therapy—the prefix in this term is endo-,
from Greek endon, inner, within.</p>
<p>Try your hand again at constructing words. What is the specialty?
__________________. And the adjective? __________________.</p>
<p>The prefix ex-, out, combines with odontos to form exodontist
(eks′-ō-DON′-tist). What do you suppose, therefore, is the work in which
this practitioner specializes? __________________.</p>
<p>And the term for the specialty? __________________.</p>
<p>For the adjective? __________________.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>measurement</li>
</ol>
<p>The optometrist, by etymology, measures vision—the term is built on
opsis, optikos, view, vision, plus metron, measurement.</p>
<p>Metron is the root in many other words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>thermometer (thƏr-MOM′-Ə-tƏr)—an instrument to measure heat
(Greek therme, heat).</p></li>
<li><p>barometer (bƏ-ROM′-Ə-ter)—an instrument to measure atmospheric
pressure (Greek baros, weight); the adjective is barometric
(bair′-Ə-MET′-rik).</p></li>
<li><p>sphygmomanometer (sfig′-mō-mƏ-NOM′-Ə-tƏr)—a device for measuring
blood pressure (Greek sphygmos, pulse).</p></li>
<li><p>metric system—a decimal system of weights and measures, long used
in other countries and now gradually being adopted in the United
States.</p></li>
<li><p>bones, feet, and hands</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Osteopath combines Greek osteon, bone, with pathos, suffering,
disease. Osteopathy (os′-tee-OP′-Ə-thee), you will recall, was
originally based on the theory that disease is caused by pressure of the
bones on blood vessels and nerves. An osteopathic (os′-tee-Ə-PATH′-ik)
physician is not a bone specialist, despite the misleading etymology—and
should not be confused with the orthopedist, who is.</p>
<p>The podiatrist (Greek pous, podos, foot, plus iatreia, medical
healing) practices podiatry (pƏ-DĪ′-Ə-tree). The adjective is podiatric
(pō′-dee-AT′-rik).</p>
<p>The root pous, podos is found also in:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>octopus (OK′-tƏ-pƏs), the eight-armed (or, as the etymology has
it, eight-footed) sea creature (Greek okto, eight).</p></li>
<li><p>platypus (PLAT′-Ə-pƏs), the strange water mammal with a duck’s
bill, webbed feet, and a beaver-like tail that reproduces by laying eggs
(Greek platys, broad, flat—hence, by etymology, a flatfoot!).</p></li>
<li><p>podium (PŌ′-dee-Əm), a speaker’s platform, etymologically a place
for the feet. (The suffix -ium often signifies “place where,” as in
gymnasium, stadium, auditorium, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>tripod (TRĪ′-pod), a three-legged (or “footed”) stand for a
camera or other device (tri-, three).</p></li>
<li><p>chiropodist (kƏ-ROP′-Ə-dist), earlier title for a podiatrist, and
still often used. The specialty is chiropody (kƏ-ROP′-Ə-dee).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Chiropody combines podos with Greek cheir, hand, spelled chiro- in
English words. The term was coined in the days before labor-saving
machinery and push-button devices, when people worked with their hands
and developed calluses on their upper extremities as well as on their
feet. Today most of us earn a livelihood in more sedentary occupations,
and so we may develop calluses on less visible portions of our
anatomy.</p>
<p>Chiropractors heal with their hands—the specialty is chiropractic
(kī′-rō-PRAK′-tik).</p>
<p>Cheir (chiro-), hand, is the root in chirography (kī-ROG′-rƏ-fee).
Recalling the graph- in graphologist, can you figure out by etymology
what chirography is? __________________</p>
<p>An expert in writing by hand, or in penmanship (a lost art in these
days of electronic word-processing),2 would be a chirographer
(kī-ROG′-rƏ-fƏr); the adjective is chirographic (kī′-rō-GRAF′-ik).</p>
<p>If the suffix -mancy comes from a Greek word meaning foretelling or
prediction, can you decide what chiromancy (KĪ′-rō-man′-see) must be?
__________________.</p>
<p>The person who practices chiromancy is a chiromancer
(KĪ′-rō-man′-sƏr); the adjective is chiromantic (kī′-rō-MAN′-tik).</p>

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>writing and writers</li>
</ol>
<p>The Greek verb graphein, to write, is the source of a great many
English words.</p>
<p>We know that the graphologist analyzes handwriting, the term
combining graphein with logos, science, study. The specialty is
graphology (grƏ-FOL′-Ə-jee), the adjective graphological
(graf′-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<p>Chirographer is built on graphein plus cheir (chiro-), hand. Though
chirography may be a lost art, calligraphy (kƏ-LIG′-rƏ-fee) is enjoying
a revival. For centuries before the advent of printing, calligraphy, or
penmanship as an artistic expression, was practiced by monks.</p>
<p>A calligrapher (kƏ-LIG′-rƏ-fƏr) is called upon to design and write
announcements, place cards, etc., as a touch of elegance. The adjective
is calligraphic (kal′-Ə-GRAF′-ik).</p>
<p>Calligraphy combines graphein with Greek kallos,3 beauty, and so, by
etymology, means beautiful writing.</p>
<p>If a word exists for artistic handwriting, there must be one for the
opposite—bad, scrawly, or illegible handwriting. And indeed there
is—cacography (kƏ-KOG′-rƏ-fee), combining graphein with Greek kakos,
bad, harsh.</p>
<p>By analogy with the forms of calligraphy, can you write the word
for:</p>
<p>One who uses bad or illegible handwriting?</p>
<p>__________________________.</p>
<p>Pertaining to, or marked by, bad handwriting (adjective)?</p>
<p>__________________________.</p>
<p>Graphein is found in other English words:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>cardiograph (discussed in Chapter 4)—etymologically a “heart
writer” (kardia, heart).</p></li>
<li><p>photograph—etymologically, “written by light” (Greek photos,
light).</p></li>
<li><p>phonograph—etymologically, a “sound writer” (Greek phone,
sound).</p></li>
<li><p>telegraph—etymologically a “distance writer” (Greek tele-,
distance).</p></li>
<li><p>biography—etymologically “life writing” (Greek, bios, life).
(Many of these new roots will be discussed in greater detail in later
chapters.)</p></li>
<li><p>aging and the old</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We know that a geriatrician specializes in the medical care of the
elderly. The Greek word geras, old age, has a derived form, geron, old
man, the root in gerontologist. The specialty is gerontology
(jair′-Ən-TOL′-Ə-jee), the adjective is gerontological
(jair′-Ən-tƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<p>The Latin word for old is senex, the base on which senile, senescent,
senior, and senate are built.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>senile (SEE′-nīl)—showing signs of the physical and/or mental
deterioration that generally marks very old age. The noun is senility
(sƏ-NIL′-Ə-tee).</p></li>
<li><p>senescent (sƏ-NES′-Ənt)—aging, growing old. (Note the same suffix
in this word as in adolescent, growing into an adult, convalescent,
growing healthy again, and obsolescent, growing or becoming obsolete.)
The noun is senescence (sƏ-NES′-Əns).</p></li>
<li><p>senior (SEEN′-yƏr)—older. Noun: seniority
(seen-YAWR′-Ə-tee).</p></li>
<li><p>senate (SEN′-Ət)—originally a council of older, and presumably
wiser, citizens.</p></li>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18)</p>
<p>BECOMING WORD-CONSCIOUS</p>
<p>Perhaps, if you have been working as assiduously with this book as I
have repeatedly counseled, you have noticed an interesting
phenomenon.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is as follows: You read a magazine article and
suddenly you see one or more of the words you have recently learned. Or
you open a book and there again are some of the words you have been
working with. In short, all your reading seems to call to your attention
the very words you’ve been studying.</p>
<p>Why? Have I, with uncanny foresight, picked words which have suddenly
and inexplicably become popular among writers? Obviously, that’s
nonsense.</p>
<p>The change is in you. You have now begun to be alert to words, you
have developed what is known in psychology as a “mind-set” toward
certain words. Therefore, whenever these words occur in your reading you
take special notice of them.</p>
<p>The same words occurred before—and just as plentifully—but since they
presented little communication to you, you reacted to them with an
unseeing eye, with an ungrasping mind. You were figuratively, and almost
literally, blind to them.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you bought, or contemplated buying, a new car?
Let’s say it was a Toyota. Suddenly you began to see Toyotas all around
you—you had a Toyota “mind-set.”</p>
<p>It is thus with anything new in your life. Development of a
“mind-set” means that the new experience has become very real, very
important, almost vital.</p>
<p>If you have become suddenly alert to the new words you have been
learning, you’re well along toward your goal of building a superior
vocabulary. You are beginning to live in a new and different
intellectual atmosphere—nothing less!</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the phenomenon I have been describing has not
yet occurred, do not despair. It will. I am alerting you to its
possibilities—recognize it and welcome it when it happens.</p>

<p>1 Psychopathy is usually characterized by antisocial and extremely
egocentric behavior. A psychopath (SĪ′-kƏ-path′), sometimes called a
psychopathic personality, appears to be lacking an inner moral censor,
and often commits criminal acts, without anxiety or guilt, in order to
obtain immediate gratification of desires. Such a person may be utterly
lacking in sexual restraint, or addicted to hard drugs. Some
psychologists prefer the label sociopath (SŌ′-shee-Ə-path′ or
SŌ′-see-Ə-path′) for this type of personality to indicate the absence of
a social conscience.</p>
<p>2 But see calligrapher in the next session.</p>
<p>3 An entrancing word that also derives from kallos is callipygian
(kal′-Ə-PIJ′-ee-Ən), an adjective describing a shapely or attractive
rear end, or a person so endowed—the combining root is pyge,
buttocks.</p>
<p>Brief Intermission Three</p>
<p>HOW GRAMMAR CHANGES</p>
<p>If you think that grammar is an exact science, get ready for a shock.
Grammar is a science, all right—but it is most inexact. There are no
inflexible laws, no absolutely hard and fast rules, no unchanging
principles. Correctness varies with the times and depends much more on
geography, on social class, and on collective human caprice than on the
restrictions found in textbooks.</p>
<p>In mathematics, which is an exact science, five and five make ten the
country over—in the North, in the South, in the West; in Los Angeles and
Coral Gables and New York. There are no two opinions on the matter—we
are dealing, so far as we know, with a universal and indisputable
fact.</p>
<p>In grammar, however, since the facts are highly susceptible to
change, we have to keep an eye peeled for trends. What are educated
people saying these days? Which expressions are generally used and
accepted on educated levels, which others are more or less restricted to
the less educated levels of speech? The answers to these questions
indicate the trend of usage in the United States, and if such trends
come in conflict with academic rules, then the rules are no longer of
any great importance.</p>
<p>Grammar follows the speech habits of the majority of educated
people—not the other way around. That is the important point to keep in
mind.</p>
<p>The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intended to
help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As
you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word
or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would
you be willing to phrase your thoughts in just such terms? Decide
whether the sentence is right or wrong, then compare your conclusion
with the opinions given following the test.</p>

</ol>
<p>RIGHT WRONG</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let’s keep this between you and I.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. Children are so frequently corrected by parents and teachers
when they say me that they cannot be blamed if they begin to think that
this simple syllable is probably a naughty word. Dialogues such as the
following are certainly typical of many households.</p>
<p>“Mother, can me and Johnnie go out and play?”</p>
<p>“No, dear, not until you say it correctly. You mean ‘May Johnnie and
I go out to play?’”</p>
<p>“Who wants a jelly apple?”</p>
<p>“Me!”</p>
<p>“Then use the proper word.”</p>
<p>(The child becomes a little confused at this point—there seem to be
so many “proper” and “improper” words.)</p>
<p>“Me, please!”</p>
<p>“No, dear, not me.”</p>
<p>“Oh. I, please?”</p>
<p>(This sounds terrible to a child’s ear. It completely violates his
sense of language, but he does want the jelly apple, so he grudgingly
conforms.)</p>
<p>“Who broke my best vase?”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t me!”</p>
<p>“Is that good English, Johnnie?”</p>
<p>“Okay, it wasn’t I. But honest, Mom, it wasn’t me—I didn’t even touch
it!”</p>
<p>And so, if the child is strong enough to survive such constant
corrections, he decides that whenever there is room for doubt, it is
safer to say I.</p>
<p>Some adults, conditioned in childhood by the kind of misguided
censorship detailed here, are likely to believe that “between you and I”
is the more elegant form of expression, but most educated speakers,
obeying the rule that a preposition governs the objective pronoun, say
“between you and me.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>I’m your best friend, ain’t I?</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. As linguistic scholars have frequently pointed out, it is
unfortunate that ain’t I? is unpopular in educated speech, for the
phrase fills a long-felt need. Am I not? is too prissy for down-to-earth
people; amn’t I? is ridiculous; and aren’t I, though popular in England,
has never really caught on in America. With a sentence like the one
under discussion you are practically in a linguistic trap—there is no
way out unless you are willing to choose between appearing illiterate,
sounding prissy, or feeling ridiculous.</p>
<p>“What is the matter with ain’t I? for am I not?” language scholar
Wallace Rice once wrote. “Nothing whatever, save that a number of minor
grammarians object to it. Ain’t I? has a pleasant sound once the ears
are unstopped of prejudice.” Mr. Rice has a valid point there, yet
educated people avoid ain’t I? as if it were catching. In all honesty,
therefore, I must say to you: don’t use ain’t I?, except humorously.
What is a safe substitute? Apparently none exists, so I suggest that you
manage, by some linguistic calisthenics, to avoid having to make a
choice. Otherwise you may find yourself in the position of being damned
if you do and damned if you don’t.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Five and five is ten.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. But don’t jump to the conclusion that “five and five are ten”
is wrong—both verbs are equally acceptable in this or any similar
construction. If you prefer to think of “five-and-five” as a single
mathematical concept, say is. If you find it more reasonable to consider
“five and five” a plural idea, say are. The teachers I’ve polled on this
point are about evenly divided in preference, and so, I imagine, are the
rest of us. Use whichever verb has the greater appeal to your sense of
logic.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>I never saw a man get so mad.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. When I questioned a number of authors and editors about their
opinion of the acceptability of mad as a synonym for angry, the typical
reaction was: “Yes, I say mad, but I always feel a little guilty when I
do.”</p>
<p>Most people do say mad when they are sure there is no English teacher
listening; it’s a good sharp word, everybody understands exactly what it
means, and it’s a lot stronger than angry, though not quite as violent
as furious or enraged. In short, mad has a special implication offered
by no other word in the English language; as a consequence, educated
people use it as the occasion demands and it is perfectly correct. So
correct, in fact, that every authoritative dictionary lists it as a
completely acceptable usage. If you feel guilty when you say mad, even
though you don’t mean insane, it’s time you stopped plaguing your
conscience with trivialities.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Every one of his sisters are unmarried.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. Are is perhaps the more logical word, since the sentence
implies that he has more than one sister and they are all unmarried. In
educated speech, however, the tendency is to make the verb agree with
the subject, even if logic is violated in the process—and the better
choice here would be is, agreeing with the singular subject, every
one.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>He visited an optometrist for an eye operation.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. If the gentleman in question did indeed need an operation, he
went to the wrong doctor. In most states, optometrists are forbidden by
law to perform surgery or administer drugs—they may only prescribe and
fit glasses. And they are not medical doctors. The M.D. who specializes
in the treatment of eye diseases, and who may operate when necessary, is
an ophthalmologist. (See Chapter 4.)</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Do you prophecy another world war?</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. Use prophecy only when you mean prediction, a noun. When you
mean predict, a verb, as in this sentence, use prophesy. This
distinction is simple and foolproof. Therefore we properly say: “His
prophecy (prediction) turned out to be true,” but “He really seems able
to prophesy (predict) political trends.” There is a distinction also in
the pronunciation of these two words. Prophecy is pronounced
PROF′-Ə-see; prophesy is pronunced PROF′-Ə-sī′.</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Leave us not mention it.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. On the less sophisticated levels of American speech, leave is
a popular substitute for let. On educated levels, the following
distinction is carefully observed: let means allow; leave means depart.
(There are a few idiomatic exceptions to this rule, but they present no
problem.) “Let me go” is preferable to “Leave me go” even on the most
informal of occasions, and a sentence like “Leave us not mention it” is
not considered standard English.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>If you expect to eventually succeed, you must keep trying.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. We have here, in case you’re puzzled, an example of that
notorious bugbear of academic grammar, the “split infinitive.” (An
infinitive is a verb preceded by to: to succeed, to fail, to
remember.)</p>
<p>Splitting an infinitive is not at all difficult—you need only insert
a word between the to and the verb: to eventually succeed, to completely
fail, to quickly remember.</p>
<p>Now that you know how to split an infinitive, the important question
is, is it legal to do so? I am happy to be able to report to you that it
is not only legal, it is also ethical, moral, and sometimes more
effective than to not split it. Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving,
Nathaniel Hawthorne, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson, among many
others, were unconscionable infinitive splitters. And modern writers are
equally partial to the construction.</p>
<p>To bring this report up to the minute, I asked a number of editors
about their attitude toward the split infinitive. Here are two typical
reactions.</p>
<p>An editor at Doubleday and Company: “The restriction against the
split infinitive is, to my mind, the most artificial of all grammatical
rules. I find that most educated people split infinitives regularly in
their speech, and only eliminate them from their writing when they
rewrite and polish their material.”</p>
<p>An editor at Reader’s Digest: “I want to defend the split infinitive.
The construction adds to the strength of the sentence—it’s compact and
clear. This is to loudly say that I split an infinitive whenever I can
catch one.”</p>
<p>And here, finally, is the opinion of humorist James Thurber, as
quoted by Rudolf Flesch in The Art of Plain Talk: “Word has somehow got
around that the split infinitive is always wrong. This is of a piece
with the outworn notion that it is always wrong to strike a lady.”</p>
<p>I think the evidence is conclusive enough—it is perfectly correct to
consciously split an infinitive whenever such an act increases the
strength or clarity of your sentence.</p>
