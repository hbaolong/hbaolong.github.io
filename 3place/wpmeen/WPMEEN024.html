<h4 id="how-to-keep-building-your-vocabulary">19 HOW TO KEEP BUILDING
YOUR VOCABULARY</h4>
<hr />
<p>At commencement exercises, whether in elementary school, high school,
or college, at least one of the speakers will inevitably point out to
the graduates that this is not the end—not by a long shot. It is only
the beginning; that’s why it is called “commencement,” etc., etc.</p>
<p>Of course the speaker is right—no educative process is ever the end;
it is always the beginning of more education, more learning, more
living.</p>
<p>And that is the case here. What has happened to you as a result of
your reaction to the material and suggestions in this book is only the
beginning of your development. To stop increasing your vocabulary is to
stop your intellectual growth. You will wish, I am sure, to continue
growing intellectually as long as you remain alive. And with the
momentum that your weeks of hard work have provided, continuing will not
be at all difficult.</p>
<p>Let me offer, as a summary of all I have said throughout the book, a
recapitulation of the steps you must take so that your vocabulary will
keep growing and growing.</p>
<p>STEP ONE. You must become actively receptive to new words.</p>
<p>Words won’t come chasing after you—you must train yourself to be on a
constant lookout, in your reading and listening, for any words that
other people know and you don’t.</p>
<p>STEP TWO. You must read more.</p>
<p>As an adult, you will find most of the sources of your supply of new
words in books and magazines. Is your reading today largely restricted
to a quick perusal of the daily newspaper? Then you will have to change
your habits. If your aim is to have a superior vocabulary, you will have
to make the time to read at least one book and several magazines every
week. Not just this week and next week—but every week for the rest of
your life. I have never met a single person who possessed a rich
vocabulary who was not also an omnivorous reader.</p>
<p>STEP THREE. You must learn to add to your own vocabulary the new
words you meet in your reading.</p>
<p>When you see an unfamiliar word in a book or magazine, do not skip
over it impatiently. Instead, pause for a moment and say it over to
yourself—get used to its sound and appearance. Then puzzle out its
possible meaning in the context of the sentence. Whether you come to the
right conclusion or not, whether indeed you are able to come to any
intelligent conclusion at all, is of no importance. What is important is
that you are, by this process, becoming superconscious of the word. As a
result, you will suddenly notice that this very word pops up
unexpectedly again and again in all your reading—for you now have a
mind-set for it. And of course after you’ve seen it a few times, you
will know fairly accurately not only what it means but the many ways in
which it can be used.</p>
<p>STEP FOUR. You must open your mind to new ideas.</p>
<p>Every word you know is the translation of an idea.</p>
<p>Think for a few minutes of the areas of human knowledge that may
possibly be unknown to you—psychology, semantics, science, art, music,
or whatever. Then attack one of these areas methodically—by reading
books in the field. In every field, from the simplest to the most
abstruse, there are several books written for the average, untrained lay
reader that will give you both a good grasp of the subject and at the
same time add immeasurably to your vocabulary. College students have
large vocabularies because they are required to expose themselves
constantly to new areas of learning. You must do the same.</p>
<p>STEP FIVE. You must set a goal.</p>
<p>If you do nothing about your vocabulary, you will learn, at most,
twenty-five to fifty new words in the next twelve months. By conscious
effort you can learn several thousand. Set yourself a goal of finding
several new words every day. This may sound ambitious—but you will
discover as soon as you start actively looking for new words in your
reading, and actively doing reading of a more challenging type, that new
words are all around you—that is, if you’re ready for them. And
understand this: vocabulary building snowballs. The results of each new
day’s search will be greater and greater—once you provide the necessary
initial push, once you gain momentum, once you become addicted to
looking for, finding, and taking possession of new words.</p>
<p>And this is one addiction well worth cultivating!</p>
