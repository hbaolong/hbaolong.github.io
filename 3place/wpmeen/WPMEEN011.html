<hr />
<p>SESSION 11</p>
<p>A true scientist lives up to the etymological meaning of his title
“one who knows.” Anything scientific is based on facts—observable facts
that can be recorded, tested, checked, and verified.</p>
<p>Science, then, deals with human knowledge—as far as it has gone. It
has gone very far indeed since the last century or two, when we stopped
basing our thinking on guesses, wishes, theories that had no foundation
in reality, and concepts of how the world ought to be; and instead began
to explore the world as it was, and not only the world but the whole
universe. From Galileo, who looked through the first telescope atop a
tower in Pisa, Italy, through Pasteur, who watched microbes through a
microscope, to Einstein, who deciphered riddles of the universe by means
of mathematics, we have at last begun to fill in a few areas of
ignorance.</p>
<p>Who are some of the more important explorers of knowledge—and by what
terms are they known?</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>whither mankind?</li>
</ol>
<p>The field is all mankind—how we developed in mind and body from
primitive cultures and early forms.</p>
<p>An anthropologist</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>what’s above?</li>
</ol>
<p>The field is the heavens and all that’s in them—planets, galaxies,
stars, and other universes.</p>
<p>An astronomer</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>and what’s below?</li>
</ol>
<p>The field is the comparatively little and insignificant whirling ball
on which we live—the earth. How did our planet come into being, what is
it made of, how were its mountains, oceans, rivers, plains, and valleys
formed, and what’s down deep if you start digging?</p>
<p>A geologist</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>what is life?</li>
</ol>
<p>The field is all living organisms—from the simplest one-celled amoeba
to the amazingly complex and mystifying structure we call a human being.
Plant or animal, flesh or vegetable, denizen of water, earth, or air—if
it lives and grows, this scientist wants to know more about it.</p>
<p>A biologist</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>flora</li>
</ol>
<p>Biology classifies life into two great divisions—plant and animal.
This scientist’s province is the former category—flowers, trees, shrubs,
mosses, marine vegetation, blossoms, fruits, seeds, grasses, and all the
rest that make up the plant kingdom.</p>
<p>A botanist</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>and fauna</li>
</ol>
<p>Animals of every description, kind, and condition, from birds to
bees, fish to fowl, reptiles to humans, are the special area of
exploration of this scientist.</p>
<p>A zoologist</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>and all the little bugs</li>
</ol>
<p>There are over 650,000 different species of insects, and millions of
individuals of every species—and this scientist is interested in every
one of them.</p>
<p>An entomologist</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>tower of Babel</li>
</ol>
<p>This linguistic scientist explores the subtle, intangible, elusive
uses of that unique tool that distinguishes human beings from all other
forms of life—to wit: language. This person is, in short, a student of
linguistics, ancient and modern, primitive and cultured, Chinese,
Hebrew, Icelandic, Slavic, Teutonic, and every other kind spoken now or
in the past by human beings, not excluding that delightful hodgepodge
known as “pidgin English,” in which a piano is described as “big box,
you hit ’um in teeth, he cry,” and in which Hamlet’s famous quandary,
“To be or not to be, that is the question…,” is translated into “Can do,
no can do—how fashion?”</p>
<p>A philologist</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>what do you really mean?</li>
</ol>
<p>This linguistic scientist explored the subtle, intangible, elusive
relationship between language and thinking, between meaning and words;
and is interested in determining the psychological causes and effects of
what people say and write.</p>
<p>A semanticist</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>who are your friends and neighbors?</li>
</ol>
<p>This scientist is a student of the ways in which people live
together, their family and community structures and customs, their
housing, their social relationships, their forms of government, and
their layers of caste and class.</p>
<p>A sociologist</p>

<p>SESSION 12</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>people and the stars</li>
</ol>
<p>Anthropologist is constructed from roots we are familiar
with—anthropos, mankind, and logos, science, study.</p>
<p>The science is anthropology (an′-thrƏ-POL′-Ə-jee). Can you write the
adjective form of this word? __________________. (Can you pronounce
it?)</p>
<p>Astronomer is built on Greek astron, star, and nomos, arrangement,
law, or order. The astronomer is interested in the arrangement of stars
and other celestial bodies. The science is astronomy (Ə-STRON′-Ə-mee),
the adjective is astronomical (as′-trƏ-NOM′-Ə-kƏl), a word often used in
a non-heavenly sense, as in “the astronomical size of the national
debt.” Astronomy deals in such enormous distances (the sun, for example,
is 93,000,000 miles from the earth, and light from stars travels toward
the earth at 186,000 miles per second) that the adjective astronomical
is applied to any tremendously large figure.</p>
<p>Astron, star, combines with logos to form astrology (Ə-STROL′-Ə-jee),
which assesses the influence of planets and stars on human events. The
practitioner is an astrologer (Ə-STROL′-Ə-jƏr). Can you form the
adjective?___________________. (Can you pronounce it?)</p>
<p>By etymology, an astronaut (AS′-trƏ-not′) is a sailor among the stars
(Greek nautes, sailor). This person is termed with somewhat less
exaggeration a cosmonaut (KOZ′-mƏ-not′) by the Russians (Greek, kosmos,
universe). Nautical (NOT′-Ə-kƏl), relating to sailors, sailing, ships,
or navigation, derives also from nautes, and nautes in turn is from
Greek naus, ship—a root used in nausea (etymologically, ship-sickness or
seasickness!).</p>
<p>Aster (AS′-tƏr) is a star shaped flower. Asterisk (AS′-tƏ-risk), a
star-shaped symbol (*), is generally used in writing or printing to
direct the reader to look for a footnote. Astrophysics
(as′-trƏ-FIZ′-iks) is that branch of physics dealing with heavenly
bodies.</p>
<p>Disaster (dƏ-ZAS′-tƏr) and disastrous (dƏ-ZAS′-trƏs) also come from
astron, star. In ancient times it was believed that the stars ruled
human destiny; any misfortune or calamity, therefore, happened to
someone because the stars were in opposition. (Dis-, a prefix of many
meanings, in this word signifies against.)</p>
<p>Nomos, arrangement, law, or order, is found in two other interesting
English words.</p>
<p>For example, if you can make your own laws for yourself, if you
needn’t answer to anyone else for what you do, in short, if you are
independent, then you enjoy autonomy (aw-TON′-Ə-mee), a word that
combines nomos, law, with autos, self. Autonomy, then, is self-law,
self-government. The fifty states in our nation are fairly autonomous
(aw-TON′-Ə-mƏs), but not completely so. On the other hand, in most
colleges each separate department is pretty much autonomous. And of
course, one of the big reasons for the revolution of 1776 was that
America wanted autonomy, rather than control by England.</p>
<p>You know the instrument that beginners at the piano use to guide
their timing? A pendulum swings back and forth, making an audible click
at each swing, and in that way governs or orders the measure (or timing)
of the player. Hence it is called a metronome (MET′-rƏ-nōm′), a word
that combines nomos with metron, measurement.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>the earth and its life</li>
</ol>
<p>Geologist derives from Greek ge (geo-), earth. The science is geology
(jee-OL′-Ə-jee). Can you write the adjective?
____________________________________. (Can you pronounce it?)</p>
<p>Geometry (jee-OM′-Ə-tree)—ge plus metron—by etymology “measurement of
the earth,” is that branch of mathematics treating of the measurement
and properties of solid and plane figures, such as angles, triangles,
squares, spheres, prisms, etc. (The etymology of the word shows that
this ancient science was originally concerned with the measurement of
land and spaces on the earth.)</p>
<p>The mathematician is a geometrician (jee′-Ə-mƏ-TRISH′-Ən), the
adjective is geometric (jee′-Ə-MET′-rik).</p>
<p>Geography (jee-OG′-rƏ-fee) is writing about (graphein, to write), or
mapping, the earth. A practitioner of the science is a geographer
(jee-OG′-rƏ-fƏr), the adjective is geographic (jee-Ə-GRAF′-ik).</p>
<p>(The name George is also derived from ge (geo-), earth, plus ergon,
work—the first George was an earth-worker or farmer.)</p>
<p>Biologist combines bios, life, with logos, science, study. The
science is biology (bī-OL′-Ə-jee). The adjective?
__________________.</p>
<p>Bios, life, is also found in biography (bī-OG′-rƏ-fee), writing about
someone’s life; autobiography (aw′-tƏ-bī-OG′-rƏ-fee), the story of one’s
life written by oneself; and biopsy (BĪ′-op-see), a medical examination,
or view (opsis, optikos, view, vision), generally through a microscope,
of living tissue, frequently performed when cancer is suspected. A small
part of the tissue is cut from the affected area and under the
microscope its cells can be investigated for evidence of malignancy. A
biopsy is contrasted with an autopsy (AW′-top-see), which is a medical
examination of a corpse in order to discover the cause of death. The
autos in autopsy means, as you know, self—in an autopsy, etymologically
speaking, the surgeon or pathologist determines, by actual view or sight
rather than by theorizing (i.e., “by viewing or seeing for oneself”),
what brought the corpse to its present grievous state.</p>
<p>Botanist is from Greek botane, plant. The field is botany
(BOT′-Ə-nee); the adjective is botanical (bƏ-TAN′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<p>Zoologist is from Greek zoion, animal. The science is zoology. The
adjective? __________________. The combination of the two o’s tempts
many people to pronounce the first three letters of these words in one
syllable, thus: zoo. However, the two o’s should be separated, as in
co-operate, even though no hyphen is used in the spelling to indicate
such separation. Say zō-OL′-Ə-jist, zō-OL′-Ə-jee, zō′-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl. Zoo,
a park for animals, is a shortened form of zoological gardens, and is,
of course, pronounced in one syllable.</p>
<p>The zodiac (ZŌ′-dee-ak) is a diagram, used in astrology, of the paths
of the sun, moon, and planets; it contains, in part, Latin names for
various animals—scorpio, scorpion; leo, lion; cancer, crab; taurus,
bull; aries, ram; and pisces, fish. Hence its derivation from zoion,
animal.</p>
<p>The adjective is zodiacal (zō-DĪ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>cutting in and out</li>
</ol>
<p>Flies, bees, beetles, wasps, and other insects are segmented
creatures—head, thorax, and abdomen. Where these parts join, there
appears to the imaginative eye a “cutting in” of the body.</p>
<p>Hence the branch of zoology dealing with insects is aptly named
entomology, from Greek en-, in, plus tome, a cutting. The adjective is
entomological (en′-tƏ-mƏ-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<p>(The word insect makes the same point—it is built on Latin in- in,
plus sectus, a form of the verb meaning to cut.)</p>
<p>The prefix ec-, from Greek ek-, means out. (The Latin prefix, you
will recall, is ex-.) Combine ec- with tome to derive the words for
surgical procedures in which parts are “cut out,” or removed:
tonsillectomy (the tonsils), appendectomy (the appendix), mastectomy
(the breast), hysterectomy (the uterus), prostatectomy (the prostate),
etc.</p>
<p>Combine ec- with Greek kentron, center (the Latin root, as we have
discovered, is centrum), to derive eccentric (Ək-SEN′-trik)—out of the
center, hence deviating from the normal in behavior, attitudes, etc., or
unconventional, odd, strange. The noun is eccentricity
(ek′-sƏn-TRIS′-Ə-tee).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>more cuts</li>
</ol>
<p>The Greek prefix a- makes a root negative; the atom (AT′-Əm) was so
named at a time when it was considered the smallest possible particle of
an element, that is, one that could not be cut any further. (We have
long since split the atom, of course, with results, as in most
technological advances, both good and evil.) The adjective is atomic
(Ə-TOM′-ik).</p>
<p>The Greek prefix ana- has a number of meanings, one of which is up,
as in anatomy (Ə-NAT′-Ə-mee), originally the cutting up of a plant or
animal to determine its structure, later the bodily structure itself.
The adjective is anatomical (an′-Ə-TOM′-Ə-kƏl).</p>
<p>Originally any book that was part of a larger work of many volumes
was called a tome (TŌM)—etymologically, a part cut from the whole.
Today, a tome designates, often disparagingly, an exceptionally large
book, or one that is heavy and dull in content.</p>
<p>The Greek prefix dicha-, in two, combines with tome to construct
dichotomy (dī-KOT′-Ə-mee), a splitting in two, a technical word used in
astronomy, biology, botany, and the science of logic. It is also
employed as a non-technical term, as when we refer to the dichotomy in
the life of a man who is a government clerk all day and a night-school
teacher after working hours, so that his life is, in a sense, split into
two parts. The verb is dichotomize (dī-KOT′-Ə-mīz′); the adjective is
dichotomous (dī-KOT′-Ə-mƏs). Dichotomous thinking is the sort that
divides everything into two parts—good and bad; white and black;
Democrats and Republicans; etc. An unknown wit has made this classic
statement about dichotomous thinking: “There are two kinds of people:
those who divide everything into two parts, and those who do not.”</p>
<p>Imagine a book, a complicated or massive report, or some other
elaborate document—now figuratively cut on or through it so that you can
get to its essence, the very heart of the idea contained in it. What you
have is an epitome (Ə-PIT′-Ə-mee), a condensation of the whole. (From
epi-, on, upon, plus tome.)</p>
<p>An epitome may refer to a summary, condensation, or abridgment of
language, as in “Let me have an epitome of the book,” or “Give me the
epitome of his speech.”</p>
<p>More commonly, epitome and the verb epitomize (Ə-PIT′-Ə-mīz′) are
used in sentences like “She is the epitome of kindness,” or “That one
act epitomizes her philosophy of life.” If you cut everything else away
to get to the essential part, that part is a representative
cross-section of the whole. So a woman who is the epitome of kindness
stands for all people who are kind; and an act that epitomizes a
philosophy of life represents, by itself, the complete philosophy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>love and words</li>
</ol>
<p>Logos, we know, means science or study; it may also mean word or
speech, as it does in philology (fƏ-LOL′-Ə-jee), etymologically the love
of words (from Greek philein, to love, plus logos), or what is more
commonly called linguistics (ling-GWIS′-tiks), the science of language,
a term derived from Latin lingua, tongue.</p>
<p>Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective form of philology?
__________________.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>more love</li>
</ol>
<p>Philanthropy (fƏ-LAN′-thrƏ-pee) is by etymology the love of
mankind—one who devotes oneself to philanthropy is a philanthropist
(fƏ-LAN′-thrƏ-pist), as we learned in Chapter 3; the adjective is
philanthropic (fil-Ən-THROP′-ik).</p>
<p>The verb philander (fƏ-LAN′-dƏr), to “play around” sexually, be
promiscuous, or have extramarital relations, combines philein with
andros, male. (Philandering, despite its derivation, is not of course
exclusively the male province. The word is, in fact, derived from the
proper name conventionally given to male lovers in plays and romances of
the 1500s and 1600s.) One who engages in the interesting activities
catalogued above is a philanderer (fƏ-LAN′-dƏr-Ər).</p>
<p>By etymology, philosophy is the love of wisdom (Greek sophos, wise);
Philadelphia is the City of Brotherly Love (Greek adelphos, brother);
philharmonic is the love of music or harmony (Greek harmonia, harmony);
and a philter, a rarely used word, is a love potion. Today we call
whatever arouses sexual desire an aphrodisiac (af′-rƏ-DIZ′-ee-ak′), from
Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love and beauty.</p>
<p>Aphrodisiac is an adjective as well as a noun, but a longer adjective
form, aphrodisiacal (af′-rƏ-dƏ-ZĪ′-Ə-kƏl), is also used.</p>
<p>A bibliophile (BIB′-lee-Ə-fīl′) is one who loves books as
collectibles, admiring their binding, typography, illustrations, rarity,
etc.—in short, a book collector. The combining root is Greek biblion,
book.</p>
<p>An Anglophile (ANG′-glƏ-fīl′) admires and is fond of the British
people, customs, culture, etc. The combining root is Latin Anglus,
English.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>words and how they affect people</li>
</ol>
<p>The semanticist is professionally involved in semantics
(sƏ-MAN′-tiks). The adjective is semantic (sƏ-MAN′-tik) or semantical
(sƏ-MAN′-tƏ-kƏl).</p>
<p>Semantics, like orthopedics, pediatrics, and obstetrics, is a
singular noun despite the -s ending. Semantics is, not are, an exciting
study. However, this rule applies only when we refer to the word as a
science or area of study. In the following sentence, semantics is used
as a plural: “The semantics of your thinking are all wrong.”</p>
<p>Two stimulating and highly readable books on the subject, well worth
a visit to the library to pick up, are Language in Thought and Action,
by S. I. Hayakawa, and People in Quandaries, by Dr. Wendell Johnson.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>how people live</li>
</ol>
<p>The profession of the sociologist is sociology (sō′-shee-OL′-Ə-jee or
sō-see-OL′-Ə-jee). Can you write, and pronounce, the adjective?
__________________.</p>
<p>Sociology is built on Latin socius, companion,1 plus logos, science,
study. Socius is the source of such common words as associate, social,
socialize, society, sociable, and antisocial; as well as asocial
(ay-SŌ′-shƏl), which combines the negative prefix a- with socius.</p>
<p>The antisocial person actively dislikes people, and often behaves in
ways that are detrimental or destructive to society or the social order
(anti-, against).</p>
<p>On the other hand, someone who is asocial is withdrawn and
self-centered, avoids contact with others, and feels completely
indifferent to the interests or welfare of society. The asocial person
doesn’t want to “get involved.”</p>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18)</p>
<p>WHERE TO GET NEW IDEAS</p>
<p>People with superior vocabularies, I have submitted, are the people
with ideas. The words they know are verbal symbols of the ideas they are
familiar with—reduce one and you must reduce the other, for ideas cannot
exist without verbalization. Freud once had an idea—and had to coin a
whole new vocabulary to make his idea clear to the world. Those who are
familiar with Freud’s theories know all the words that explain them—the
unconscious, the ego, the id, the superego, rationalization, Oedipus
complex, and so on. Splitting the atom was once a new idea—anyone
familiar with it knew something about fission, isotope, radioactive,
cyclotron, etc.</p>
<p>Remember this: your vocabulary indicates the alertness and range of
your mind. The words you know show the extent of your understanding of
what’s going on in the world. The size of your vocabulary varies
directly with the degree to which you are growing intellectually.</p>
<p>You have covered so far in this book several hundred words. Having
learned these words, you have begun to think of an equal number of new
ideas. A new word is not just another pattern of syllables with which to
clutter up your mind—a new word is a new idea to help you think, to help
you understand the thoughts of others, to help you express your own
thoughts, to help you live a richer intellectual life.</p>
<p>Realizing these facts, you may become impatient. You will begin to
doubt that a book like this can cover all the ideas that an alert and
intellectually mature adult wishes to be acquainted with. Your doubt is
well-founded.</p>
<p>One of the chief purposes of this book is to get you started, to give
you enough of a push so that you will begin to gather momentum, to
stimulate you enough so that you will want to start gathering your own
ideas.</p>
<p>Where can you gather them? From good books on new topics.</p>
<p>How can you gather them? By reading on a wide range of new
subjects.</p>
<p>Reference has repeatedly been made to psychology, psychiatry, and
psychoanalysis in these pages. If your curiosity has been piqued by
these references, here is a good place to start. In these fields there
is a tremendous and exciting literature—and you can read as widely and
as deeply as you wish.</p>
<p>What I would like to do is offer a few suggestions as to where you
might profitably begin—how far you go will depend on your own
interest.</p>
<p>I suggest, first, half a dozen older books (older, but still
immensely valuable and completely valid) available at any large public
library.</p>
<p>The Human Mind, by Karl A. Menninger</p>
<p>Mind and Body, by Flanders Dunbar</p>
<p>The Mind in Action, by Eric Berne</p>
<p>Understandable Psychiatry, by Leland E. Hinsie</p>
<p>A General Introduction to Psychoanalysis, by Sigmund Freud</p>
<p>Emotional Problems of Living, by O. Spurgeon English and Gerald H. J.
Pearson</p>
<p>Next, I suggest books on some of the newer approaches in psychology.
These are available in inexpensive paperback editions as well as at your
local library.</p>
<p>I Ain’t Well—But I Sure Am Better, by Jess Lair, Ph.D.</p>
<p>The Disowned Self, by Nathaniel Brandon</p>
<p>A Primer of Behavioral Psychology, by Adelaide Bry</p>
<p>I’m OK—You’re OK, by Thomas A. Harris, M.D.</p>
<p>Freedom to Be and Man the Manipulator, by Everett L. Shostrum</p>
<p>Games People Play, by Eric Berne, M.D.</p>
<p>Love and Orgasm, Pleasure and The Language of the Body, by Alexander
Lowen, M.D.</p>
<p>The Transparent Self, by Sydney M. Jourard</p>
<p>Don’t Say Yes When You Want to Say No, by Herbert Fensterheim and
Jean Baer</p>
<p>Gestalt Therapy Verbatim, by Frederick S. Perls</p>
<p>Born to Win, by Muriel James and Dorothy Jongeward</p>
<p>Joy and Here Comes Everybody, by William C. Schutz</p>
<p>The Fifty-Minute Hour, by Robert Lindner</p>
<p>(End of Session 13)</p>

<p>1 Companion itself has an interesting etymology—Latin com-, with,
plus panis, bread. If you are social, you enjoy breaking bread with
companions. Pantry also comes from panis, though far more than bread is
stored there.</p>
<p>Brief Intermission Four</p>
<p>HOW TO AVOID BEING A PURIST</p>
<p>Life, as you no doubt realize, is complicated enough these days. Yet
puristic textbooks and English teachers with puristic ideas are striving
to make it still more complicated. Their contribution to the complexity
of modern living is the repeated claim that many of the natural,
carefree, and popular expressions that most of us use every day are “bad
English,” “incorrect grammar,” “vulgar,” or “illiterate.”</p>
<p>In truth, many of the former restrictions and “thou shalt nots” of
academic grammar are now outmoded—most educated speakers quite simply
ignore them.</p>
<p>Students in my grammar classes at Rio Hondo College are somewhat
nonplused when they discover that correctness is not determined by
textbook rules and cannot be enforced by schoolteacher edict. They
invariably ask: “Aren’t you going to draw the line somewhere?”</p>
<p>It is neither necessary nor possible for any one person to “draw the
line.” That is done—and quite effectively—by the people themselves, by
the millions of educated people throughout the nation.</p>
<p>Of course certain expressions may be considered “incorrect” or
“illiterate” or “bad grammar”—not because they violate puristic rules,
but only because they are rarely if ever used by educated speakers.</p>
<p>Correctness, in short, is determined by current educated usage.</p>
<p>The following notes on current trends in modern usage are intended to
help you come to a decision about certain controversial expressions. As
you read each sentence, pay particular attention to the italicized word
or words. Does the usage square with your own language patterns? Would
you be willing to phrase your thoughts in just such terms? Decide
whether the sentence is “right” or “wrong,” then compare your
conclusions with the opinions given after the test.</p>

</ol>
<p>RIGHT WRONG</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Let’s not walk any further right now.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. In the nineteenth century, when professional grammarians
attempted to Latinize English grammar, an artificial distinction was
drawn between farther and further, to wit: farther refers to space,
further means to a greater extent or additional. Today, as a result,
many teachers who are still under the forbidding influence of
nineteenth-century restrictions insist that it is incorrect to use one
word for the other.</p>
<p>To check on current attitudes toward this distinction, I sent the
test sentence above to a number of dictionary editors, authors, and
professors of English, requesting their opinion of the acceptability of
further in reference to actual distance. Sixty out of eighty-seven
professors, over two thirds of those responding, accepted the usage
without qualification. Of twelve dictionary editors, eleven accepted
further, and in the case of the authors, thirteen out of twenty-three
accepted the word as used. A professor of English at Cornell University
remarked: “I know of no justification for any present-day distinction
between further and farther”; and a consulting editor of the Funk and
Wagnalls dictionary said, “There is nothing controversial here. As
applied to spatial distance, further and farther have long been
interchangeable.”</p>
<p>Perhaps the comment of a noted author and columnist is most to the
point: “I like both further and farther, as I have never been able to
tell which is which or why one is any farther or further than the
other.”</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Some people admit that their principle goal in life is to become
wealthy.</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. In speech, you can get principal and principle confused as
often as you like, and no one will ever know the difference—both words
are pronounced identically. In writing, however, your spelling will give
you away.</p>
<p>There is a simple memory trick that will help you if you get into
trouble with these two words. Rule and principle both end in -le—and a
principle is a rule. On the other hand, principal contains an a, and so
does main—and principal means main. Get these points straight and your
confusion is over.</p>
<p>Heads of schools are called principals, because they are the main
person in that institution of learning. The money you have in the bank
is your principal, your main financial assets. And the stars of a play
are principals—the main actors.</p>
<p>Thus, “Some people admit that their principal (main) goal in life is
to become wealthy,” but “Such a principle (rule) is not guaranteed to
lead to happiness.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>What a nice thing to say!</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. Purists object to the popular use of nice as a synonym for
pleasant, agreeable, or delightful. They wish to restrict the word to
its older and more erudite meaning of exact or subtle. You will be happy
to hear that they aren’t getting anywhere.</p>
<p>When I polled a group of well-known authors on the acceptability in
everyday speech of the popular meaning of nice, their opinions were
unanimous; not a single dissenting voice, out of the twenty-three
authors who answered, was raised against the usage. One writer
responded: “It has been right for about 150 years …”</p>
<p>Editors of magazines and newspapers questioned on the same point were
just a shade more conservative. Sixty out of sixty-nine accepted the
usage. One editor commented: “I think we do not have to be nice about
nice any longer. No one can eradicate it from popular speech as a
synonym for pleasant, or enjoyable, or kind, or courteous. It is a
workhorse of the vocabulary, and properly so.”</p>
<p>The only valid objection to the word is that it is overworked by some
people, but this shows a weakness in vocabulary rather than in
grammar.</p>
<p>As in the famous story of the editor who said to her secretary:
“There are two words I wish you would stop using so much. One is ‘nice’
and the other is ‘lousy.’”</p>
<p>“Okay,” said the secretary, who was eager to please. “What are
they?”</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>He’s pretty sick today.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. One of the purist’s pet targets of attack is the word pretty
as used in the sentence under discussion. Yet all modern dictionaries
accept such use of pretty, and a survey made by a professor at the
University of Wisconsin showed that the usage is established
English.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>I feel awfully sick.</li>
</ol>
<p>RIGHT. Dictionaries accept this usage in informal speech and the
University of Wisconsin survey showed that it is established
English.</p>
<p>The great popularity of awfully in educated speech is no doubt due to
the strong and unique emphasis that the word gives to an
adjective—substitute very, quite, extremely, or severely and you
considerably weaken the force.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is somewhat less than cultivated to say “I feel
awful sick,” and the wisdom of using awfully to intensify a pleasant
concept (“What an awfully pretty child”; “That book is awfully
interesting”) is perhaps still debatable, though getting less and less
so as the years go on.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Are you going to invite Doris and I to your party?</li>
</ol>
<p>WRONG. Some people are almost irresistibly drawn to the pronoun I in
constructions like this one. However, not only does such use of I
violate a valid and useful grammatical principle, but, more important,
it is rarely heard in educated speech. The meaning of the sentence is
equally clear no matter which form of the pronoun is employed, of
course, but the use of I, the less popular choice, may stigmatize the
speaker as uneducated.</p>
<p>Consider it this way: You would normally say, “Are you going to
invite me to your party?” It would be wiser, therefore, to say, “Are you
going to invite Doris and me to your party?”</p>
