TO TALK ABOUT A VARIETY OF PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS</h4>
<p>(Sessions 45–46)</p>
<hr />
<p>TEASER PREVIEW</p>
<p>What word, ending in -ous, describes someone who is:</p>
<p>• fawning, servilely attentive, transparently self-ingratiating?</p>
<p>• nagging, dissatisfied, complaining?</p>
<p>• snobbish, haughtily contemptuous, arrogant?</p>
<p>• noisily troublesome, unmanageable?</p>
<p>• habitually short of cash?</p>
<p>• attentive and courteous to women?</p>
<p>• harmless?</p>
<p>• fond of liquor?</p>
<p>• pale, gaunt, haggard?</p>
<p>• melancholy, sorrowful?</p>
<hr />
<p>SESSION 45</p>
<p>There are thousands of English words that end in the letters -ous—a
Latin suffix meaning full of.</p>
<p>The central theme about which the words in this chapter revolve is
the idea of “fullness”—and as you will shortly see, you can be full of
compliance and servility; full of complaints; full of snobbery; full of
noise; full of no money; full of horsemanship; full of harmlessness;
full of liquor; full of deathly pallor; and full of sorrows.</p>
<p>For each of these ideas English has a word—and the person with a rich
vocabularly knows the exact word to describe what someone is full
of.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>compliance</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root sequor means to follow—and those who follow rather
than lead are usually in a menial, subordinate, or inferior position.
People who engage in certain fields of endeavor—waiters, clerks, and
servants, for example—are forced, often contrary to their natural
temperaments, to act excessively courteous, pleasant, obliging, even
subservient and humble. They must follow the lead of their customers or
employers, bending their own wills according to the desires of those
they serve. They are, etymologically, full of following after, or—</p>
<p>obsequious</p>
<p>RELATED WORDS:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>obsequies—In a funeral cortege, the mourners follow after the
corpse. Hence, obsequies are the burial ceremonies, the funeral
rites.</p></li>
<li><p>subsequent—A subsequent letter, paragraph, time, etc. is one that
follows another.</p></li>
<li><p>sequel—A sequel may be a literary work, such as a novel, that
follows another, continuing the same subject, dealing with the same
people or village, etc. or it may be an occurrence that grows out of or
follows another, as in, “Just wait until you hear the sequel to the
story!”</p></li>
<li><p>sequence—In order, one item following another, as in, “The
sequence of events of the next few days left him breathless.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Any other word containing the root sequ- is likely to have some
relationship to the idea of following.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>complaints</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root queror means to complain—and anyone full of
complaints, constantly nagging, harping, fretful, petulant, whining,
never satisfied, may accordingly be called—</p>
<p>querulous</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>snobbery</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root cilium means eyelid; super means above; and above the
eyelid, as anyone can plainly see, is the eyebrow. Now there are certain
obnoxious people who go around raising their eyebrows in contempt,
disdain, and sneering arrogance at ordinary mortals like you and me.
Such contemptuous, sneering, overbearingly conceited people are
called—</p>
<p>supercilious</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>noise</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root strepo means to make a noise. Anyone who is unruly,
boisterous, resistant to authority, unmanageable—and in a noisy,
troublesome manner—is</p>
<p>obstreperous</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>moneyless</li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root pecus means cattle—and at one time in human history a
person’s wealth was measured not by stocks and bonds but by stocks of
domestic animals, which was a lot more logical, since you get milk and
leather and meat from cattle—true wealth—and all you get from the stock
market is a headache.</p>
<p>Someone who had lots of pecus, then, was rich—someone without pecus
was indigent, destitute, “broke.” And so today we call someone who is
habitually without funds, who seems generally to be full of a complete
lack of money—</p>
<p>impecunious</p>
<p>This word is not a synonym of indigent, destitute, or
poverty-stricken; it does not necessarily imply living in reduced
circumstances or want, but quite simply being short of
cash—habitually.</p>
<p>RELATED WORD:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>pecuniary—pertaining to money, as in, a pecuniary consideration,
pecuniary affairs, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>horses</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The French word cheval means horse; and in medieval times only
gentlemen and knights rode on horses—common people walked. Traditionally
(but not, I understand, actually) knights were courteous to women,
attentive to female desires, and self-sacrificing when their own
interests came in conflict with those of the fair sex. Hence, we call a
modern man who has a knightly attitude to women—</p>
<p>chivalrous</p>
<p>RELATED WORD:</p>
<p>(Cheval, horse, comes from Latin caballus, an inferior horse.
Callabus is found in English words in the spelling caval-.)</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>cavalcade—A procession of persons on horseback, as in a
parade.</p></li>
<li><p>cavalier—As a noun, a cavalier was once a mounted soldier. As an
adjective, cavalier describes actions and attitudes that are haughty,
unmindful of others’ feelings, too offhand, such attributes often being
associated with people in power (the military being one of the
powers-that-be). Thus, “He answered in a cavalier manner” would signify
that he was arrogant in his answer, as if the questioner were taking a
little too much privilege with him. Or, “After the cavalier treatment I
received, I never wished to return,” signifying that I was pretty much
made to feel unimportant and inferior. Or, “After her cavalier refusal,
I’ll never invite her to another party,” signifying that the refusal
was, perhaps, curt, offhand, without any attempt at apology or
courtesy.</p></li>
<li><p>cavalry—The mounted, or “horsed” part of an army.</p></li>
<li><p>chivalry—Noun form of chivalrous. Can you write the alternate
noun form ending in -ness? __________________</p></li>
<li><p>chivalric—Less commonly used adjective form, identical in meaning
to chivalrous.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Another Latin root for horse, as you know, is equus, found in words
we have already discussed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>equestrian—A horseman.</p></li>
<li><p>equestrienne—A horsewoman.</p></li>
<li><p>equine—Horselike.</p></li>
<li><p>no harm done</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The latin root noceo means to injure; someone who need cause you no
fear, so harmless is that person, so unable to interfere, so unlikely to
get you into trouble, is called—</p>
<p>innocuous</p>
<p>RELATED WORDS:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>innocent—Not guilty of crime or injury.</p></li>
<li><p>noxious—Harmful, poisonous; unwholesome.</p></li>
<li><p>alcoholic</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root bibo means to drink; and one who is generally found
with one foot up on the brass rail, who likes to tipple beyond the point
of sobriety—who, in short, has an overfondness for drinks with a
pronounced alcoholic content, is called, usually humorously—</p>
<p>bibulous</p>
<p>RELATED WORD:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>imbibe—To drink in, soak up, absorb. If we use this verb without
specifying what is drunk, as in, “He likes to imbibe,” the implication,
of course, is always liquor; but imbibe may also be used in patterns
like “imbibe learning” or “In early infancy she imbibed a respect for
her parents.”</p></li>
<li><p>bib—Upper part of an apron, or an apronlike napkin tied around a
child’s neck. In either case, the bib prevents what is drunk (or eaten)
from spilling over, or dribbling down, on the wearer’s
clothing.</p></li>
<li><p>like death itself</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root cado means to fall—one’s final fall is of course
always in death, and so someone who looks like a corpse (figuratively
speaking), who is pale, gaunt, thin, haggard, eyes deep-sunk, limbs
wasted, in other words the extreme opposite of the picture of glowing
health, is called—</p>
<p>cadaverous</p>
<p>RELATED WORD:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>cadaver—A corpse, literally, especially one used for surgical
dissection.</p></li>
<li><p>decadent—Etymologically, “falling down” (de- is a prefix one
meaning of which is down, as in descend, climb down; decline, turn down;
etc.). If something is in a decadent state, it is deteriorating,
becoming corrupt or demoralized. Decadence is a state of decay.
Generally decadent and decadence are used figuratively—they refer not to
actual physical decay (as of a dead body), but to moral or spiritual
decay.</p></li>
<li><p>pain and misery</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Latin root doleo means to suffer or grieve—one who is mournful
and sad, whose melancholy comes from physical pain or mental distress,
who seems to be suffering or grieving, is called—</p>
<p>dolorous</p>
<p>RELATED WORD:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>dolor—A poetic synonym of grief.</p></li>
<li><p>doleful—A word referring somewhat humorously to exaggerated
dismalness, sadness, or dreariness.</p></li>
<li><p>condole—Etymologically, to suffer or grieve with (Latin con-,
with, together). Condole is a somewhat less commonly used synonym of
commiserate, a verb we discussed in Chapter 15. The noun condolence is
much more frequently heard than the verb, as in, “Let me offer you my
condolences,” usually said to someone mourning the death of a friend or
relative. You have heard of condolence cards, and no doubt have sent
your share of them. When you condole with somebody who has sustained a
loss, usually by death, you are saying, in effect, “I am suffering or
grieving with you.”</p></li>

<p>TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In logic, a conclusion not based on the evidence is called a non
sequitur; by extension, the term is applied to any statement that
appears to have no connection or relevance to what was said before.
Knowing the root sequor, how would you define this term etymologically?
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Sequor, like many other Latin verbs, has another form somewhat
differently spelled. (Remember verto, versus and loquor, locutus?) The
other form of sequor is secutus. Can you define the following words in
terms of the root?</p></li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>second: ______________________</p></li>
<li><p>consecutive: ______________________</p></li>
<li><p>persecute: ______________________</p></li>
<li><p>prosecute: ______________________</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Latin super, above or over, is used as a prefix in hundreds of
English words. Can you figure out the word starting with super- that
fits each etymological definition?</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>above others (in quality, position, etc.)
__________________</p></li>
<li><p>above the surface; not in depth (adj.)
__________________</p></li>
<li><p>(flowing) above what is necessary; more than needed (adj.)
__________________</p></li>
<li><p>above (or beyond) the natural (adj.) __________________</p></li>
<li><p>to oversee; be in charge of (v.) __________________</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Cado, to fall, is found in the following English words (sometimes
the root is spelled -cid). Can you define each word in terms of its
etymological parts?</li>
</ol>
<ol type="a">
<li><p>cadence: _____________________</p></li>
<li><p>occidental: _____________________</p></li>
<li><p>deciduous: _____________________</p></li>
<li><p>incident: _____________________</p></li>
<li><p>accident: _____________________</p></li>
<li><p>coincidence: _____________________</p></li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>The negative prefix in- plus doleo, to suffer, forms an adjective
that etymologically means not suffering (pain), but actually means idle;
lazy; disliking effort or work. Can you figure out the English word?
__________________.</li>

<p>Can you write the noun form? __________________.</p>
