<p>TEASER PREVIEW</p>
<p>What word aptly describes:</p>
<p>• dire poverty?</p>
<p>• emotion experienced without direct participation?</p>
<p>• something which lasts a very short time?</p>
<p>• an inoffensive word for an unpleasant idea?</p>
<p>• light and easy banter?</p>
<p>• someone who is cowlike in his stolidity?</p>
<p>• homesickness?</p>
<p>• harsh sound?</p>
<p>• a meat-eating animal?</p>
<p>• something kept secret?</p>
<hr />
<p>SESSION 39</p>
<p>This world, Robert Louis Stevenson once claimed—with, I think,
questionable logic—is so full of a number of things that we should all
be as happy as kings.</p>
<p>I doubt very strongly that happiness comes from the outside, or that
kings are necessarily happy. But I will go this far (and no further)
with Stevenson: the world is certainly full of a number of things. For
instance, poverty and misery, hospitals and insane asylums, slums and
racial restrictions, cut-down forests and once fertile lands becoming
progressively more arid, war and death and taxes and bumbling diplomats.
I know that Stevenson had a different sort of thing in mind, for
romantic poets tend to view the world through rose-tinted spectacles,
but it is often necessary to counter one extreme with another—and I
simply wish to set the record straight.</p>
<p>In this chapter we are going to discuss a number of things to be
found in the world and in the minds of its inhabitants—poverty and
wealth; secondhand emotions; the relativity of time; praise of various
sorts; small talk and how to indulge in it; animals; longings for the
past; sounds; eating habits; and many kinds and conditions of
secrecy.</p>
<p>As you see, when you start exploring ideas, as we constantly do in
these chapters, you never know what will turn up.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>for want of the green stuff</li>
</ol>
<p>There are those people who are forced (often through no fault of
their own) to pursue an existence not only devoid of such luxuries as
radios, television sets, sunken bathtubs, electric orange-juice
squeezers, automobiles, Jacuzzis, private swimming pools, etc., but
lacking also in many of the pure necessities of living—sufficient food,
heated homes, hot water, vermin- and rodent-free surroundings, decent
clothing, etc.</p>
<p>Such people live:</p>
<p>in penury</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>at least watch it</li>
</ol>
<p>All normal people want and need love and at least a modicum of
excitement in their lives—so say the psychologists. If no one loves
them, and if they can find no one on whom to lavish their own love, they
may often satisfy their emotional longings and needs by getting their
feelings secondhand—through reading love stories, attending motion
pictures, watching soap operas, etc.</p>
<p>These are:</p>
<p>vicarious feelings</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>time is fleeting</li>
</ol>
<p>During the late winter and early spring of 1948–49, great numbers of
people went practically berserk joining and forming “pyramid clubs.” If
you have not heard of this amazing phenomenon, I won’t attempt to
describe it in any of its multifarious ramifications, but the main point
was that you paid two dollars, treated some people to coffee and
doughnuts, and shortly thereafter (if you were gullible enough to fall
for this get-rich-quick scheme) supposedly received a return of some
fantastic amount like ,064 for your investment.</p>
<p>For a short time, pyramid clubs were a rage—soon they had vanished
from the American scene.</p>
<p>Anything that lasts for but a short time and leaves no trace is:</p>
<p>ephemeral</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>how not to call a spade…</li>
</ol>
<p>Words are only symbols of things—they are not the things themselves.
(This, by the way, is one of the basic tenets of semantics.) But many
people identify the word and the thing so closely that they fear to use
certain words that symbolize things that are unpleasant to them.</p>
<p>I know that this is confusing, so let me illustrate.</p>
<p>Words having to do with death, sex, certain portions of the anatomy,
excretion, etc. are avoided by certain people.</p>
<p>These people prefer circumlocutions—words that “talk around” an idea
or that mean or imply something but don’t come right out and say so
directly.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>WORD CIRCUMLOCUTION</p>
<p>die expire; depart this life; pass away; leave this vale of tears</p>
<p>sexual intercourse (intimate) relations; “playing house”; “shacking
up”</p>
<p>prostitute lady of the evening; fille de joie; painted woman; lady of
easy virtue; fille de nuit; streetwalker; hooker</p>
<p>house of prostitution house of ill-fame; bawdyhouse; house of
ill-repute; bagnio; brothel; bordello; “house”; “massage parlor”</p>
<p>buttocks, behind derrière; rear end; butt; tail</p>
<p>breasts bosom; bust; curves</p>
<p>oilet powder room; little girl’s room; facilities; washroom;
lavatory; head</p>
<p>The left-hand column is the direct, non-pussyfooting word. The
right-hand column is made up of:</p>
<p>euphemisms</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>small talk</li>
</ol>
<p>“Whenever I’m in the dumps, I get a new suit.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so that’s where you get them!”</p>
<p>“Lend me a dime—I want to phone one of my friends.”</p>
<p>“Here’s a quarter—call them all.”</p>
<p>“The doctor says I have snoo in my blood!”</p>
<p>“Snoo? What’s snoo?”</p>
<p>“Not a darn! What’s new with you?”</p>
<p>“What are twins?”</p>
<p>“Okay, what are twins?”</p>
<p>“Womb mates!”</p>
<p>“I took a twip yesterday.”</p>
<p>“A twip?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I took a twip on a twain!”</p>
<p>These are examples of:</p>
<p>badinage</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>everything but give milk</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ve seen a cow contentedly munching its cud. Nothing seems capable
of disturbing this animal—and the animal seems to want nothing more out
of life than to lead a simple, vegetable existence.</p>
<p>Some people are like a cow—calm, patient, placid, phlegmatic,
vegetable-like. They are:</p>
<p>bovine1</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>good old days</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you sometimes experience a keen, almost physical, longing for
associations or places of the past?</p>
<p>When you pass the neighborhood in which you were born and where you
spent your early years, do you have a sharp, strange reaction, almost
akin to mild nausea?</p>
<p>When you are away from home and friends and family, do pleasant
remembrances crowd in on your mind to the point where your present
loneliness becomes almost unbearable, and you actually feel a little
sick?</p>
<p>This common feeling is called:</p>
<p>nostalgia</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>sounds that grate</li>
</ol>
<p>Some sounds are so harsh, grating, and discordant that they offend
the ear. They lack all sweetness, harmony, pleasantness. Traffic noises
of a big city, electronic rock music, chalk squeaking on a
blackboard.…</p>
<p>Such blaring, ear-splitting, or spine-tingling sounds are called:</p>
<p>cacophonous</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>eating habits</li>
</ol>
<p>Lions, tigers, wolves, and some other mammals subsist entirely on
flesh. No spinach, salad greens, whole-wheat cereals, sugar, or
spices—just good, red meat.</p>
<p>These mammals are:</p>
<p>carnivorous</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>private and public</li>
</ol>
<p>There are certain things most of us do in private, like taking a
bath. Some people like to engage in other activities in complete
privacy—eating, reading, watching TV, sleeping, for example.</p>
<p>The point is that, while these activities may be conducted in
privacy, there is never any reason for keeping them secret.</p>
<p>But there are other activities that are kept not only private, but
well-shrouded in secrecy and concealed from public knowledge. These
activities are unethical, illegal, or unsafe—like having an affair with
someone whose spouse is your best friend, betraying military secrets to
the enemy, trading in narcotics, bribing public officials, etc.</p>
<p>Arrangements, activities, or meetings that fall under this category
are called:</p>
<p>clandestine</p>

<p>SESSION 40</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>money, and what it will buy</li>
</ol>
<p>The modern world operates largely by means of a price
structure—wealth and poverty are therefore words that indicate the
possession, on the one hand, or the lack, on the other, of money.
Penury, from Latin penuria, need, neediness, is dire, abject poverty,
complete lack of financial resources. It is one of the two strongest
English words there are to denote absence of money. The adjective form,
penurious (pƏ-NYr′-ee-Əs or pƏ-NR′ ee-Əs), strangely enough, may mean
poverty-stricken, but more commonly signifies stingy, close-fisted,
niggardly; so sparing in the use of money as to give the appearance of
penury.</p>
<p>Penurious is a synonym of parsimonious (pahr′-sƏ-MŌ′-nee-Əs), but is
much stronger in implication. A parsimonious person is stingy; a
penurious person is twice as stingy. Penury, then, is poverty;
penuriousness is stinginess, excessive frugality. The noun form of
parsimonious is parsimony (PAHR′-sƏ-mō′-nee).</p>
<p>A somewhat milder word than penury for poverty (if you can imagine a
mild degree of poverty) is indigence (IN′-dƏ-jƏns). Indigent
(IN′-dƏ-jƏnt) people are not absolutely penniless—they are simply living
in reduced circumstances, forgoing many creature comforts, forced to
undergo the type of hardships that may accompany a lack of sufficient
funds.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a close synonym of penury, and one of equal
strength, is destitution (des′-tƏ-T′-shƏn). Destitute (DES′-tƏ-tt)
people do not even have the means for mere subsistence—as such, they are
perhaps on the verge of starvation. Penury and destitution are not
merely straitened circumstances—they are downright desperate
circumstances.</p>
<p>To turn now to the brighter side of the picture, the possession of
money, especially in increasing amounts, is expressed by affluence
(AF′-l-Əns). Affluent (AF′-l-Ənt) people, people of affluence, or those
living in affluent circumstances, are more than comfortable; in
addition, there is the implication that their wealth is increasing.
People who live in affluence probably own large and costly homes, run
big, new cars, belong to expensive golf or country clubs, etc.</p>
<p>A much stronger term is opulence (OP′-yƏ-lƏns), which not only
implies much greater wealth than affluence, but in addition suggests
lavish expenditures and ostentatiously luxurious surroundings. People of
opulence own estates; drive only outrageously expensive and specially
equipped cars (Rolls-Royces, Mercedes-Benzes, Porsches, etc.); have a
corps of servants, including a major-domo; belong to golf and yacht and
country clubs, etc., etc. Embroider the fantasy as much as you wish to.
Opulent (OP′-yƏ-lƏnt) may describe people, surroundings, styles of life,
or the like.</p>
<p>Affluent is a combination of the prefix ad-, to, toward (changing to
af- before a root beginning with f), plus the Latin verb fluo, to
flow—affluence is that delightful condition in which money keeps flowing
to us, and no one ever turns off the spigot. Other words from the same
root, fluo, to flow, are fluid, influence, confluence (a “flowing
together”), fluent (the words flow smoothly), etc.</p>
<p>Opulent is from Latin opulentus, wealthy. No other English words
derive from this root.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>doing and feeling</li>
</ol>
<p>If you watch a furious athletic event, and you get tired, though the
athletes expend all the energy—that’s vicarious fatigue.</p>
<p>If your friend goes on a bender, and as you watch him absorb one
drink after another, you begin to feel giddy and stimulated, that’s
vicarious intoxication.</p>
<p>If you watch a mother in a motion picture or dramatic play suffer
horribly at the death of her child, and you go through the same agony,
that’s vicarious torment.</p>
<p>You can experience an emotion, then, in two ways: firsthand, through
actual participation; or vicariously, by becoming empathetically
involved in another person’s feelings.</p>
<p>Some people, for example, lead essentially dull and colorless lives.
Through their children, through reading or attending the theater,
however, they can experience all the emotions felt by others whose lives
move along at a swift, exciting pace. These people live at second hand;
they live vicariously.</p>

<li>time is relative</li>
</ol>
<p>Elephants and turtles live almost forever; human beings in the United
States have a life expectancy in general of sixty-eight to seventy-six
years (though the gradual conquest of disease is constantly lengthening
our span);2 dogs live from seven to ten years; and some insects exist
for only a few hours or days.</p>
<p>One such short-lived creature is the dayfly, which in Greek was
called ephemera. Hence anything so short-lived, so unenduring that it
scarcely seems to outlast the day, may be called ephemeral.</p>
<p>A synonym of ephemeral is evanescent (ev-Ə-NES′-Ənt), fleeting,
staying for a remarkably short time, vanishing. Something intangible,
like a feeling, may be called evanescent; it’s here, and before you can
quite comprehend it, it’s gone—vanished.</p>
<p>The noun is evanescence (ev′-Ə-NES′-Əns); the verb is to evanesce
(ev-Ə-NES′).</p>
<p>Evanescent is built on the prefix e- (ex-), out, the root vanesco, to
vanish, and the adjective suffix -ent.</p>
<p>The suffix -esce often, but not always, means begin to. -Escent may
mean becoming or beginning to. Thus:</p>
<p>adolescent—beginning to grow up;</p>
<p>beginning to become an adult</p>
<p>evanesce—begin to vanish</p>
<p>convalesce—begin to get well after illness</p>
<p>putrescent—beginning to rot;</p>
<p>beginning to become putrid</p>
<p>obsolescent—becoming obsolete</p>

<p>A euphemism is a word or expression that has been substituted for
another that is likely to offend—it is built on the Greek prefix eu-,
good, the root pheme, voice, and the noun suffix -ism. (Etymologically,
“something said in a good voice!”) Adjective: euphemistic
(y′-fƏ-MIS′-tik)</p>
<p>Other English words constructed from the prefix eu-:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>euphony (YOO′-fƏ-nee)—good sound; pleasant lilt or rhythm (phone,
sound)</li>
</ol>
<p>Adjective: euphonic (y-FON′-ik) or euphonious (y-FŌ′-nee-Əs)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>eulogy (Y′-lƏ-jee)—etymologically, “good speech”; a formal speech of
praise, usually delivered as a funeral oration. Logos in this term means
word or speech, as it did in philology (Chapter 6). Logos more commonly
means science or study, but has the alternate meaning in eulogy,
philology, monologue, dialogue, epilogue (words upon the other words, or
“after-words”), and prologue (words before the main part,
“before-words,” or introduction).</li>
</ol>
<p>Adjective: eulogistic (y-lƏ-JIS′-tik); verb: eulogize (Y-lƏ-jīz′);
person who delivers a eulogy: eulogist (Y-lƏ-jist)</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>euphoria (y-FAWR′-ee-Ə)—good feeling, a sense of mental buoyancy and
physical well-being</li>
</ol>
<p>Adjective: euphoric (y-FAWR′-ik)</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>euthanasia (y′-thƏ-NAY′-zhƏ)—etymologically, “good death”; method
of painless death inflicted on people suffering from incurable
diseases—not legal at the present time, but advocated by many people.
The word derives from eu- plus Greek thanatos, death.</p></li>
<li><p>exploration of modes of expression</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Badinage is a half-teasing, non-malicious, frivolous banter, intended
to amuse rather than wound. Badinage has a close synonym, persiflage
(PUR′-sƏ-flahzh′), which is a little more derisive, a trifle more
indicative of contempt or mockery—but still totally unmalicious.</p>
<p>In line with badinage and persiflage, there are four other forms of
expression you should be familiar with: cliché (klee-SHAY′), bromide
(BRŌ′-mīd′), platitude (PLAT′-Ə-td), and anodyne (AN′-Ə-dīn′).</p>
<p>A cliché is a pattern of words which was once new and fresh, but
which now is so old, worn, and threadbare that only banal, unimaginative
speakers and writers ever use it. Examples are: fast and furious; unsung
heroes; by leaps and bounds; conspicuous by its absence; green with
envy; etc. The most devastating criticism you can make of a piece of
writing is to say, “It is full of clichés”; the most pointed insult to a
person’s way of talking is, “You speak in clichés.”</p>
<p>A bromide is any trite, dull, and probably fallacious remark that
shows little evidence of original thinking, and that therefore convinces
a listener of the total absence of perspicacity on the part of the
speaker.</p>
<p>For instance, some cautious, dull-minded individual might warn you
not to take a chance in these words: “Remember it’s better to be safe
than sorry!”</p>
<p>Your sneering response might be: “Oh, that old bromide!”</p>
<p>A platitude is similar to a cliché or bromide, in that it is a dull,
trite, hackneyed, unimaginative pattern of words—but, to add insult to
injury (cliché), the speaker uses it with an air of novelty—as if he
just made it up, and isn’t he the brilliant fellow!</p>
<p>An anodyne, in the medical sense, is a drug that allays pain without
curing an illness, like aspirin or morphine. Figuratively, an anodyne is
a statement made to allay someone’s fears or anxieties, not believed by
the speaker, but intended to be believed by the listener. “Prosperity is
just around the corner” was a popular anodyne of the 1930s.</p>
<p>A bromide is also a drug, formerly used as a sedative. Sedatives dull
the senses—the statement labeled a bromide comes from a speaker of dull
wit and has a sedative effect on the listener. The adjective is bromidic
(brō-MID′-ik), as in “his bromidic way of expressing himself.”</p>
<p>Platitude derives from Greek platys, broad or flat, plus the noun
suffix -tude. Words like plateau (flat land), plate and platter (flat
dishes), and platypus (flat foot) all derive from the same root as
platitude, a flat statement, i.e., one that falls flat, despite the
speaker’s high hopes for it. The adjective is platitudinous
(plat′-Ə-T-dƏ-nƏs), as in, “What a platitudinous remark.”</p>
<p>Anodyne is a combination of the negative prefix an- with Greek odyne,
pain. Anodynes, as drugs, lessen pain; as statements, they are intended
to reduce or eliminate emotional pain or anxiety.</p>

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>people are the craziest animals</li>
</ol>
<p>Bovine, placid like a cow, stolid, patient, unexcitable, is built on
the Latin word for ox or cow, bovis, plus the suffix -ine, like, similar
to, or characteristic of. To call someone bovine is of course far from
complimentary, for this adjective is considerably stronger than
phlegmatic, and implies a certain mild contempt on the part of the
speaker. A bovine person is somewhat like a vegetable: eats and grows
and lives, but apparently is lacking in any strong feelings.</p>
<p>Humans are sometimes compared to animals, as in the following
adjectives:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>leonine (LEE′-Ə-nīn′)—like a lion in appearance or
temperament.</p></li>
<li><p>canine (KAY′-nīn′)—like a dog. As a noun, the word refers to the
species to which dogs belong. Our canine teeth are similar to those of a
dog.</p></li>
<li><p>feline (FEE′-līn′)—catlike. We may speak of feline grace; or
(insultingly) of feline temperament when we mean that a person is
“catty.”</p></li>
<li><p>porcine (PAWR′-sīn′)—piglike.</p></li>
<li><p>vulpine (VUL′-pīn′)—foxlike in appearance or temperament. When
applied to people, this adjective usually indicates the shrewdness of a
fox.</p></li>
<li><p>ursine (UR′-sīn′)—bearlike.</p></li>
<li><p>lupine (L′-pīn)—wolflike.</p></li>
<li><p>equine (EE′-kwīn′)—horselike; “horsy.”</p></li>
<li><p>piscine (PIS′-īn′)—fishlike.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All these adjectives come from the corresponding Latin words for the
animals; and, of course, each adjective also describes, or refers to,
the specific animal as well as to the person likened to the animal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>leo lion</p></li>
<li><p>canis dog</p></li>
<li><p>felis cat</p></li>
<li><p>porcus pig</p></li>
<li><p>vulpus fox</p></li>
<li><p>ursus bear</p></li>
<li><p>lupus wolf</p></li>
<li><p>equus horse</p></li>
<li><p>piscis fish</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The word for meat from a pig—pork—derives, obviously, from porcus.
Ursa Major and Ursa Minor, the Great Bear and the Little Bear, the two
conspicuous groups of stars in the northern sky (conspicuous, of course,
only on a clear night), are so labeled because in formation they
resemble the outlines of bears. The feminine name Ursula is, by
etymology, “a little bear,” which, perhaps, is a strange name to burden
a child with. The skin disease lupus was so named because it eats into
the flesh, as a wolf might.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>you can’t go home again</li>
</ol>
<p>Nostalgia, built on two Greek roots, nostos, a return, and algos,
pain (as in neuralgia, cardialgia, etc.), is a feeling you can’t ever
understand until you’ve experienced it—and you have probably experienced
it whenever some external stimulus has crowded your mind with scenes
from an earlier day.</p>
<p>You know how life often seems much pleasanter in retrospect? Your
conscious memory tends to store up the pleasant experiences of the past
(the trauma and unpleasant experiences may get buried in the
unconscious), and when you are lonely or unhappy you may begin to relive
these pleasant occurrences. It is then that you feel the emotional pain
and longing that we call nostalgia.</p>
<p>The adjective is nostalgic (nos-TAL′-jik), as in “motion pictures
that are nostalgic of the fifties,” or as in, “He feels nostalgic
whenever he passes 138th Street and sees the house in which he grew
up.”</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>soundings</li>
</ol>
<p>Cacophony is itself a harsh-sounding word—and is the only one that
exactly describes the unmusical, grating, ear-offending noises you are
likely to hear in man-made surroundings: the New York subway trains
thundering through their tunnels (they are also, these days in the late
1970s, eye-offending, for which we might coin the term cacopsis, noun,
and cacoptic, adjective), the traffic bedlam of rush hours in a big
city, a steel mill, an automobile factory, a blast furnace, etc.
Adjective: cacophonous (kƏ-KOF′-Ə-nƏs).</p>
<p>These words are built on the Greek roots kakos, bad, harsh, or ugly,
and phone, sound.</p>
<p>Phone, sound, is found also in:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>telephone—etymologically, “sound from afar”</p></li>
<li><p>euphony—pleasant sound</p></li>
<li><p>phonograph—etymologically, “writer of sound”</p></li>
<li><p>saxophone—a musical instrument (hence sound) invented by Adolphe
Sax</p></li>
<li><p>xylophone—a musical instrument; etymologically, “sounds through
wood” (Greek xylon, wood)</p></li>
<li><p>phonetics (fƏ-NET′-iks)—the science of the sounds of language;
the adjective is phonetic (fƏ-NET′-ik), the expert a phonetician
(fō′-nƏ-TISH′-Ən)</p></li>
<li><p>phonics—the science of sound; also the method of teaching reading
by drilling the sounds of letters and syllables</p></li>
<li><p>the flesh and all</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Carnivorous combines carnis, flesh, and voro, to devour. A
carnivorous animal, or carnivore (KAHR′-nƏ-vawr′), is one whose main
diet is meat.</p>
<p>Voro, to devour, is the origin of other words referring to eating
habits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>herbivorous (hur-BIV′-Ər-Əs)—subsisting on grains, grasses, and
other vegetation, as cows, deer, horses, etc. The animal is a herbivore
(HUR′-bƏ-vawr′). Derivation: Latin herba, herb, plus voro, to
devour</p></li>
<li><p>omnivorous (om-NIV′-Ər-Əs)—eating everything: meat, grains,
grasses, fish, insects, and anything else digestible. The only species
so indiscriminate in their diet are humans and rats, plus, of course,
some cats and dogs that live with people (in contrast to felines and
canines—lions, tigers, bobcats, wolves, etc.—that are not domesticated).
Omnivorous (combining Latin omnis, all, with voro, plus the adjective
suffix -ous) refers not only to food. An omnivorous reader reads
everything in great quantities (that is, devours all kinds of reading
matter).</p></li>
<li><p>voracious (vaw-RAY′-shƏs)—devouring; hence, greedy or gluttonous;
may refer either to food or to any other habits. One may be a voracious
eater, voracious reader, voracious in one’s pursuit of money, pleasure,
etc. Think of the two noun forms of loquacious. Can you write two nouns
derived from voracious? (1) __________________, (2)
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>“allness”</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Latin omnis, all, is the origin of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>omnipotent (om-NIP′-Ə-tƏnt)—all-powerful, an adjective usually
applied to God; also, to any ruler whose governing powers are unlimited,
which allows for some exaggeration, as King Canute the Great proved to
his sycophantic courtiers when he ordered the tide to come so far up the
beach and no further. He got soaking wet! (Omnis plus Latin potens,
potentis, powerful, as in potentate, a powerful ruler; impotent
(IM′-pƏ-tƏnt), powerless; potent, powerful; and potential, possessing
power or ability not yet exercised). Can you write the noun form of
omnipotent?</p></li>
<li><p>omniscient (om-NISH′-Ənt)—all-knowing: hence, infinitely wise.
(Omnis plus sciens, knowing.) We have discussed this adjective in a
previous chapter, so you will have no problem writing the noun:
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>omnipresent (om′-nƏ-PREZ′-Ənt)—present in all places at once.
Fear was omnipresent in Europe during 1939 just before World War II. A
synonym of omnipresent is ubiquitous (y-BIK′-wƏ-tƏs), from Latin ubique,
everywhere. The ubiquitous ice cream vendor seems to be everywhere at
the same time, tinkling those little bells, once spring arrives. The
ubiquitous little red wagon rides around everywhere in airports to
refuel departing planes. “Ubiquitous laughter greeted the press
secretary’s remark,” i.e., laughter was heard everywhere in the room.
The noun forms are ubiquity (y-BIK′-wƏ-tee) or __________________. (Can
you think of the alternate form?)</p></li>
<li><p>omnibus (OM′-nƏ-bƏs)—etymologically, “for all, including all.” In
the shortened form bus we have a public vehicle for all who can pay; in
a John Galsworthy omnibus we have a book containing all of Galsworthy’s
works; in an omnibus legislative bill we have a bill containing all the
miscellaneous provisions and appropriations left out of other
bills.</p></li>
<li><p>more flesh</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note how carnis, flesh, is the building block of:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>carnelian (kahr-NEEL′-yƏn)—a reddish color, the color of red
flesh.</p></li>
<li><p>carnival (KAHR′-nƏ-vƏl)—originally the season of merrymaking just
before Lent, when people took a last fling before saying “Carne vale!”
“Oh flesh, farewell!” (Latin vale, farewell, goodbye). Today a carnival
is a kind of outdoor entertainment with games, rides, side shows, and,
of course, lots of food—also any exuberant or riotous merrymaking or
festivities.</p></li>
<li><p>carnal (KAHR′-nƏl)—most often found in phrases like “carnal
pleasures” or “carnal appetites,” and signifying pleasures or appetites
of the flesh rather than of the spirit—hence, sensual, lecherous,
lascivious, lubricious, etc. The noun is carnality
(kahr-NAL′-Ə-tee).</p></li>
<li><p>carnage (KAHR′-nƏj)—great destruction of life (that is, of human
flesh), as in war or mass murders.</p></li>
<li><p>reincarnation (ree′-in-kahr-NAY′-shƏn)—a rebirth or reappearance.
Believers in reincarnation maintain that one’s soul persists after it
has fled the flesh, and eventually reappears in the body of a newborn
infant or animal, or in another form. Some of us, according to this
interesting philosophy, were once Napoleon, Alexander the Great,
Cleopatra, etc. The verb is to reincarnate (ree-in-KAHR′-nayt), to bring
(a soul) back in another bodily form.</p></li>
<li><p>incarnate (in-KAHR′-nƏt)—in the flesh. If we use this adjective
to call someone “the devil incarnate,” we mean that here is the devil in
the flesh. Or we may say that someone is evil incarnate, that is, the
personification of evil, evil invested with human or bodily form. The
verb to incarnate (in-KAHR′-nayt) is to embody, give bodily form to, or
make real.</p></li>
<li><p>dark secrets</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Clandestine comes from Latin clam, secretly, and implies secrecy or
concealment in the working out of a plan that is dangerous or illegal.
Clandestine is a close synonym of surreptitious (sur′-Əp-TISH′-Əs),
which means stealthy, sneaky, furtive, generally because of fear of
detection.</p>
<p>The two words cannot always, however, be used interchangeably. We may
speak of either clandestine or surreptitious meetings or arrangements;
but usually only of clandestine plans and only of surreptitious
movements or actions. Can you write the noun form of surreptitious?

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18)</p>
<p>GETTING USED TO NEW WORDS</p>
<p>Reference has been made, in previous chapters, to the intimate
relationship between reading and vocabulary building. Good books and the
better magazines will not only acquaint you with a host of new ideas
(and, therefore, new words, since every word is the verbalization of an
idea), but also will help you gain a more complete and a richer
understanding of the hundreds of words you are learning through your
work in this book. If you have been doing a sufficient amount of
stimulating reading—and that means, at minimum, several magazines a week
and at least three books of non-fiction a month—you have been meeting,
constantly, over and over again, the new words you have been learning in
these pages. Every such encounter is like seeing an old friend in a new
place. You know how much better you understand your friends when you
have a chance to see them react to new situations; similarly, you will
gain a much deeper understanding of the friends you have been making
among words as you see them in different contexts and in different
places.</p>
<p>My recommendations in the past have been of non-fiction titles, but
novels too are a rich source of additions to your vocabulary—provided
you stay alert to the new words you will inevitably meet in reading
novels.</p>
<p>The natural temptation, when you encounter a brand-new word in a
novel, is to ignore it—the lines of the plot are perfectly clear even if
many of the author’s words are not.</p>
<p>I want to counsel strongly that you resist the temptation to ignore
the unfamiliar words you may meet in your novel reading: resist it with
every ounce of your energy, for only by such resistance can you keep
building your vocabulary as you read.</p>
<p>What should you do? Don’t rush to a dictionary, don’t bother
underlining the word, don’t keep long lists of words that you will
eventually look up en masse—these activities are likely to become
painful and you will not continue them for any great length of time.</p>
<p>Instead, do something quite simple—and very effective.</p>
<p>When you meet a new word, underline it with a mental pencil. That is,
pause for a second and attempt to figure out its meaning from its use in
the sentence or from its etymological root or prefix, if it contains one
you have studied. Make a mental note of it, say it aloud once or
twice—and then go on reading.</p>
<p>That’s all there is to it. What you are doing, of course, is
developing the same type of mind-set toward the new word that you have
developed toward the words you have studied in this book. And the
results, of course, will be the same—you will begin to notice the word
occurring again and again in other reading you do, and finally, having
seen it in a number of varying contexts, you will begin to get enough of
its connotation and flavor to come to a fairly accurate understanding of
its meaning. In this way you will be developing alertness not only to
the words you have studied in this book, but to all expressive and
meaningful words. And your vocabulary will keep growing.</p>
<p>But of course that will happen only if you keep reading.</p>
<p>I do not wish to recommend any particular novels or novelists, since
the type of fiction one enjoys is a very personal matter. You doubtless
know the kind of story you like—mystery, science fiction, spy,
adventure, historical, political, romantic, Western, biographical, one
or all of the above. Or you may be entranced by novels of ideas, of
sexual prowess, of fantasy, of life in different segments of society
from your own. No matter. Find the kind of novel or novelist you enjoy
by browsing in the public library or among the thousands of titles in
bookstores that have a rich assortment of paperbacks as well as
hardbacks.</p>
<p>And then read! And keep on the alert for new words! You will find
them by the hundreds and thousands. Bear in mind: people with rich
vocabularies have been reading omnivorously, voraciously, since
childhood—including the ingredients listed in small print on bread
wrappers and cereal boxes.</p>

<p>HOW TO SPELL A WORD</p>
<p>The spelling of English words is archaic, it’s confusing, it’s
needlessly complicated, and, if you have a sense of humor, it’s
downright comical. In fact, any insulting epithet you might wish to
level against our weird methods of putting letters together to form
words would probably be justified—but it’s our spelling, and we’re stuck
with it.</p>
<p>How completely stuck we are is illustrated by a somewhat ludicrous
event that goes back to 1906, and that cost philanthropist Andrew
Carnegie 5,000.</p>
<p>Working under a five-year grant of funds from Carnegie, and headed by
the esteemed scholar Brander Matthews, the Simplified Spelling Board
published in that year a number of recommendations for bringing some
small semblance of order out of the great chaos of English spelling.
Their suggestions affected a mere three hundred words out of the half
million then in the language. Here are a few examples, to give you a
general idea:</p>
<p>SPELLING THEN CURRENT SIMPLIFIED SPELLING</p>
<p>mediaeval medieval</p>
<p>doubt dout</p>
<p>debtor dettor</p>
<p>head hed</p>
<p>hough tho</p>
<p>hrough thru</p>
<p>laugh laf</p>
<p>ough tuf</p>
<p>knife nife</p>
<p>heatre theater</p>
<p>centre center</p>
<p>phantom fantom</p>
<p>These revisions seemed eminently sensible to no less a personage than
the then President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt. So
delighted was he with the new garb in which these three hundred words
could be clothed that he immediately ordered that all government
documents be printed in simplified spelling. And the result? Such a howl
went up from the good citizens of the republic, from the nation’s
editors and schoolteachers and businessmen, that the issue was finally
debated in the halls of Congress. Almost to a man, senators and
representatives stood opposed to the plan. Teddy Roosevelt, as you have
doubtless heard, was a stubborn fellow—but when Congress threatened to
hold up the White House stationery appropriation unless the President
backed down, Teddy rescinded the order. Roosevelt ran for re-election
some time later, and lost. That his attitude toward spelling contributed
to his defeat is of course highly doubtful—nevertheless an opposition
New York newspaper, the day the returns were in, maliciously commented
on the outgoing incumbent in a one-word simplified-spelling editorial:
“THRU!”</p>
<p>Roosevelt was not the first President to be justifiably outraged by
our ridiculous orthography. Over a hundred years ago, when Andrew
Jackson was twitted on his poor spelling, he is supposed to have made
this characteristic reply, “Well, sir, it is a damned poor mind that
cannot think of more than one way to spell a word!” And according to one
apocryphal version, it was Jackson’s odd spelling that gave birth to the
expression “okay.” Jackson thought, so goes the story, that “all
correct” was spelled “orl korrect,” and he used O.K. as the abbreviation
for these words when he approved state papers.</p>
<p>Many years ago, the British playwright George Bernard Shaw offered a
dramatic proposal for reducing England’s taxes. Just eliminate
unnecessary letters from our unwieldy spelling, he said, and you’ll save
enough money in paper and printing to cut everyone’s tax rate in half.
Maybe it would work, but it’s never been put to the test—and the way
things look now, it never will be. Current practice more and more holds
spelling exactly where it is, bad though it may be. It is a scientific
law of language that if enough people make a “mistake,” the “mistake”
becomes acceptable usage. That law applies to pronunciation, to grammar,
to word meanings, but not to spelling. Maybe it’s because of our
misbegotten faith in, and worship of, the printed word—maybe it’s
because written language tends to be static, while spoken language
constantly changes. Whatever the cause, spelling today successfully
resists every logical effort at reform. “English spelling,” said
Thorstein Veblen, “satisfies all the requirements of the canons of
reputability under the law of conspicuous waste. It is archaic,
cumbrous, and ineffective.” Perfectly true. Notwithstanding, it’s here
to stay.</p>
<p>Your most erudite friend doubtless misspells the name of the Hawaiian
guitar. I asked half a dozen members of the English department of a
large college to spell the word—without exception they responded with
ukelele. Yet the only accepted form is ukulele.</p>
<p>Judging from my experience with my classes at Rio Hondo College, half
the population of the country must think the word is spelled alright.
Seventy-five per cent of the members of my classes can’t spell
embarrassing or coolly. People will go on misspelling these four words,
but the authorized spellings will remain impervious to change.</p>
<p>Well, you know the one about Mohammed and the mountain. Though it’s
true that we have modernized spelling to a microscopic extent in the
last eighty years (traveler, center, theater, medieval, labor, and
honor, for example, have pretty much replaced traveller, centre,
theatre, mediaeval, labour, and honour), still the resistance to change
has not observably weakened. If spelling won’t change, as it probably
won’t, those of us who consider ourselves poor spellers will have to.
We’ll just have to get up and go to the mountain.</p>
<p>Is it hard to become a good speller? I have demonstrated over and
over again in my classes that anyone of normal intelligence and average
educational background can become a good speller in very little
time.</p>
<p>What makes the task so easy?</p>
<p>First—investigations have proved that 95 per cent of the spelling
errors that educated people make occur in just one hundred words. Not
only do we all misspell the same words—but we misspell them in about the
same way.</p>
<p>Second—correct spelling relies exclusively on memory, and the most
effective way to train memory is by means of association or, to use the
technical term, mnemonics.</p>
<p>If you fancy yourself an imperfect or even a terrible speller, the
chances are very great that you’ve developed a complex solely because
you misspell some or all of the hundred words with which this
Intermission deals. When you have conquered this single list, and I
shall immediately proceed to demonstrate how easy it is, by means of
mnemonics, to do so, 95 per cent of your spelling difficulties will in
all likelihood vanish.</p>
<p>Let us start with twenty-five words from the list. In the first
column you will find the correct spelling of each, and in the second
column the simple mnemonic that will forevermore fix that correct
spelling in your memory.</p>
<p>CORRECT SPELLING MNEMONIC</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>all right Two words, no matter what it means. Keep in mind that
it’s the opposite of all wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>coolly Of course you can spell cool—simply add the adverbial
ending -ly.</p></li>
<li><p>supersede This is the only word in the language ending in -sede
(the only one, mind you—there isn’t a single other one so
spelled).</p></li>
<li><p>succeed The only three words in the entire</p></li>
<li><p>proceed language ending in -ceed. When you</p></li>
<li><p>exceed think of the three words in the order given here, the
initial letters form the beginning of SPEED.</p></li>
<li><p>cede, precede, recede, etc. All other words with a
similar-sounding final syllable end in -cede.</p></li>
<li><p>procedure One of the double e’s of proceed moves to the end in
the noun form, procedure.</p></li>
<li><p>stationery This is the word that means paper, and notice the -er
in paper.</p></li>
<li><p>stationary In this spelling, the words means standing, and notice
the -a in stand.</p></li>
<li><p>recommend Commend, which we all spell correctly, plus the prefix
re-.</p></li>
<li><p>separate Look for a rat in both words.</p></li>
<li><p>comparative</p></li>
<li><p>ecstasy to sy (sigh) with ecstasy</p></li>
<li><p>analyze The only two non-technical words in</p></li>
<li><p>paralyze the whole language ending in -yze.</p></li>
<li><p>repetition First four letters identical with those in the allied
form repeat.</p></li>
<li><p>irritable Think of allied forms irritate and</p></li>
<li><p>inimitable imitate.</p></li>
<li><p>absence Think of the allied form absent, and you will not be
tempted to misspell it abscence.</p></li>
<li><p>superintendent The superintendent in an apartment house collects
the rent—thus you avoid superintendant.</p></li>
<li><p>conscience Science plus prefix con-.</p></li>
<li><p>anoint Think of an ointment, hence no double n.</p></li>
<li><p>ridiculous Think of the allied form ridicule, which we usually
spell correctly, thus avoiding rediculous.</p></li>
<li><p>despair Again, think of another form—desperate—and so avoid
dispair.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Whether or not you have much faith in your spelling ability, you will
need very little time to conquer the preceding twenty-five demons. Spend
a few minutes, now, on each of those words in the list that you’re
doubtful of, and then test your success by means of the exercise below.
Perhaps to your astonishment, you will find it easy to make a high
score.</p>

<p>Mere repetitious drill is of no value in learning to spell a word
correctly. You’ve probably heard the one about the youngster who was
kept after school because he was in the habit of using the ungrammatical
expression “I have went.” Miss X was going to cure her pupil, even if it
required drastic measures. So she ordered him to write “I have gone” one
thousand times. “Just leave your work on my desk before you go home,”
she said, “and I’ll find it when I come in tomorrow morning.” Well,
there were twenty pages of neat script on her desk next morning, one
thousand lines of “I have gone’s,” and on the last sheet was a note from
the child. “Dear Teacher,” it read, “I have done the work and I have
went home.” If this didn’t actually happen, it logically could have, for
in any drill, if the mind is not actively engaged, no learning will
result. If you drive a car, or sew, or do any familiar and repetitious
manual work, you know how your hands can carry on an accustomed task
while your mind is far away. And if you hope to learn to spell by
filling pages with a word, stop wasting your time. All you’ll get for
your trouble is writer’s cramp.</p>
<p>The only way to learn to spell those words that now plague you is to
devise a mnemonic for each one.</p>
<p>If you are never quite sure whether it’s indispensible or
indispensable, you can spell it out one hundred, one thousand, or one
million times—and the next time you have occasion to write it in a
sentence, you’ll still wonder whether to end it with -ible or -able. But
if you say to yourself just once that able people are generally
indispensable, that thought will come to you whenever you need to spell
the word; in a few seconds you’ve conquered another spelling demon. By
engineering your own mnemonic through a study of the architecture of a
troublesome word, you will become so quickly and completely involved
with the correct spelling of that word that it will be impossible for
you ever to be stumped again.</p>
<p>Let us start at once. Below you will find another twenty-five words
from the list of one hundred demons, each offered to you in both the
correct form and in the popular misspelling. Go through the test
quickly, checking off what you consider a proper choice in each case. In
that way you will discover which of the twenty-five you would be likely
to get caught on. Then devise a personal mnemonic for each word you
flunked, writing your ingenious result out in the margin of the page.
And don’t be alarmed if some of your mnemonics turn out kind of
silly—the sillier they are the more likely you are to recall them in an
emergency. One of my pupils, who could not remember how many l’s to put
into tranquillity (or is it tranquility?), shifted his mind into high
gear and came up with this: “In the old days life was more tranquil than
today, and people wrote with quills instead of fountain pens.
Hence—tranquillity!” Another pupil, a girl who always chewed her nails
over irresistible before she could decide whether to end it with -ible
or -able, suddenly realized that a certain brand of lipstick was called
irresistible, the point being of course that the only vowel in lipstick
is i—hence, -ible! Silly, aren’t they? But they work. Go ahead to the
test now; and see how clever—or silly—you can be.</p>

<p>By now you’re well on the way toward developing a definite
superiority complex about your spelling—which isn’t a half-bad thing,
for I’ve learned, working with my students, that many people think
they’re awful spellers, and have completely lost faith in their ability,
solely because they get befuddled over no more than two dozen or so
common words that they use over and over again and always misspell.
Every other word they spell perfectly, but they still think they’re
prize boobs in spelling until their self-confidence is restored. So if
you’re beginning to gain more assurance, you’re on the right track. The
conquest of the one hundred common words most frequently misspelled is
not going to assure you that you will always come out top man in a
spelling bee, but it’s certain to clean up your writing and bolster your
ego.</p>
<p>So far you have worked with fifty of the one hundred spelling demons.
Here, now, is the remainder of the list. Test yourself, or have someone
who can keep a secret test you, and discover which ones are your
Waterloo. Study each one you miss as if it were a problem in
engineering. Observe how it’s put together and devise whatever
association pattern will fix the correct form in your mind.</p>
<p>Happy spelling!</p>
