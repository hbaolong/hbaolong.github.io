LYING</h4>
<p>(Sessions 14–17)</p>
<hr />
<p>TEASER PREVIEW</p>
<p>What kind of liar are you if you:</p>
<p>• have developed a reputation for falsehood?</p>
<p>• are particularly skillful?</p>
<p>• cannot be reformed?</p>
<p>• have become habituated to your vice?</p>
<p>• started to lie from the moment of your birth?</p>
<p>• always lie?</p>
<p>• cannot distinguish fact from fancy?</p>
<p>• suffer no pangs of conscience?</p>
<p>• are suspiciously smooth and fluent in your lying?</p>
<p>• tell vicious lies?</p>
<hr />
<p>SESSION 14</p>
<p>It was the famous Greek philosopher and cynic Diogenes who went
around the streets of Athens, lantern in hand, looking for an honest
person.</p>
<p>This was over two thousand years ago, but I presume that Diogenes
would have as little success in his search today. Lying seems to be an
integral weakness of mortal character—I doubt that few human beings
would be so brash as to claim that they have never in their lives told
at least a partial untruth. Indeed, one philologist goes so far as to
theorize that language must have been invented for the sole purpose of
deception. Perhaps so. It is certainly true that animals seem somewhat
more honest than humans, maybe because they are less gifted
mentally.</p>
<p>Why do people lie? To increase their sense of importance, to escape
punishment, to gain an end that would otherwise be denied them, out of
long-standing habit, or sometimes because they actually do not know the
difference between fact and fancy. These are the common reasons for
falsification. No doubt there are other, fairly unique, motives that
impel people to distort the truth. And, to come right down to it, can we
always be certain what is true and what is false?</p>
<p>If lying is a prevalent and all-too-human phenomenon, there would of
course be a number of interesting words to describe different types of
liars.</p>
<p>Let us pretend (not to get personal, but only to help you become
personally involved in the ideas and words) that you are a liar.</p>
<p>The question is, what kind of liar are you?</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>you don’t fool even some of the people</li>
</ol>
<p>Everybody knows your propensity for avoiding facts. You have built so
solid and unsavory a reputation that only a stranger is likely to be
misled—and then, not for long.</p>
<p>A notorious liar</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>to the highest summits of artistry</li>
</ol>
<p>Your ability is top-drawer—rarely does anyone lie as convincingly or
as artistically as you do. Your skill has, in short, reached the zenith
of perfection. Indeed, your mastery of the art is so great that your
lying is almost always crowned with success—and you have no trouble
seducing an unwary listener into believing that you are telling gospel
truth.</p>
<p>A consummate liar</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>beyond redemption or salvation</li>
</ol>
<p>You are impervious to correction. Often as you may be caught in your
fabrications, there is no reforming you—you go right on lying despite
the punishment, embarrassment, or unhappiness that your distortions of
truth may bring upon you.</p>
<p>An incorrigible liar</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>too old to learn new tricks</li>
</ol>
<p>You are the victim of firmly fixed and deep-rooted habits. Telling
untruths is as frequent and customary an activity as brushing your teeth
in the morning, or having toast and coffee for breakfast, or lighting up
a cigarette after dinner (if you are a smoker). And almost as
reflexive.</p>
<p>An inveterate liar</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>an early start</li>
</ol>
<p>You have such a long history of persistent falsification that one can
only suspect that your vice started when you were reposing in your
mother’s womb. In other words, and allowing for a great deal of
exaggeration for effect, you have been lying from the moment of your
birth.</p>
<p>A congenital liar</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>no letup</li>
</ol>
<p>You never stop lying. While normal people lie on occasion, and often
for special reasons, you lie continually—not occasionally or even
frequently, but over and over.</p>
<p>A chronic liar</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>a strange disease</li>
</ol>
<p>You are not concerned with the difference between truth and
falsehood; you do not bother to distinguish fact from fantasy. In fact,
your lying is a disease that no antibiotic can cure.</p>
<p>A pathological liar</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>no regrets</li>
</ol>
<p>You are completely without a conscience. No matter what misery your
fabrications may cause your innocent victims, you never feel the
slightest twinge of guilt. Totally unscrupulous, you are a dangerous
person to get mixed up with.</p>
<p>An unconscionable liar</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>smooth!</li>
</ol>
<p>Possessed of a lively imagination and a ready tongue, you can distort
facts as smoothly and as effortlessly as you can say your name. But you
do not always get away with your lies.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, it is your very smoothness that makes you suspect:
your answers are too quick to be true. Even if we can’t immediately
catch you in your lies, we have learned from unhappy past experience not
to suspend our critical faculties when you are talking. We admire your
nimble wit, but we listen with a skeptical ear.</p>
<p>A glib liar</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>outstanding!</li>
</ol>
<p>Lies, after all, are bad—they are frequently injurious to other
people, and may have a particularly dangerous effect on you as a liar.
At best, if you are caught you suffer some embarrassment. At worst, if
you succeed in your deception your character becomes warped and your
sense of values suffers. Almost all lies are harmful; some are no less
than vicious.</p>
<p>If you are one type of liar, all your lies are vicious—calculatedly,
predeterminedly, coldly, and advisedly vicious. In short, your lies are
so outstandingly hurtful that people gasp in amazement and disgust at
hearing them.</p>
<p>An egregious liar</p>
<p>In this chapter the ten basic words revolve rather closely around a
central core. Each one, however, has a distinct, a unique meaning, a
special implication. Note the differences.</p>
<p>TYPE OF LIAR SPECIAL IMPLICATION</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>notorious famous—or infamous—for lying; tendency to falsify is
well-known</p></li>
<li><p>consummate great skill</p></li>
<li><p>incorrigible too far gone to be reformed—impervious to
rehabilitation</p></li>
<li><p>inveterate lying has become a deep-rooted habit</p></li>
<li><p>congenital lying had very early beginnings—as if from
birth</p></li>
<li><p>chronic over and over</p></li>
<li><p>pathological an irresistible compulsion to lie—often for no
rational reason; lying is a disease</p></li>
<li><p>unconscionable lack of regret or remorse</p></li>
<li><p>glib great smoothness</p></li>
<li><p>egregious viciousness of the lies</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These ten expressive adjectives, needless to say, are not restricted
to lying or liars. Note their general meanings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>notorious well-known for some bad quality—a notorious
philanderer</p></li>
<li><p>consummate perfect, highly skilled—consummate artistry at the
keyboard</p></li>
<li><p>incorrigible beyond reform—an incorrigible optimist</p></li>
<li><p>inveterate long-accustomed, deeply habituated—an inveterate
smoker (this adjective, like notorious, usually has an unfavorable
connotation)</p></li>
<li><p>congenital happening at or during birth–a congenital
deformity</p></li>
<li><p>chronic going on for a long time, or occurring again and
again—chronic appendicitis</p></li>
<li><p>pathological diseased—a pathological condition</p></li>
<li><p>unconscionable without pangs of conscience–unconscionable cruelty
to children</p></li>
<li><p>glib smooth, suspiciously fluent–a glib witness</p></li>
<li><p>egregious outstandingly bad or vicious–an egregious
error</p></li>
</ol>
<p>With the exception of consummate and congenital, all ten adjectives
have strongly derogatory implications and are generally used to describe
people, characteristics, or conditions we disapprove of.</p>

<p>(End of Session 14)</p>
<p>SESSION 15</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>well-known</li>
</ol>
<p>“Widely but unfavorably known” is the common definition for
notorious. Just as a notorious liar is well-known for unreliable
statements, so a notorious gambler, a notorious thief, or a notorious
killer has achieved a wide reputation for some form of antisocial
behavior. The noun is notoriety (nō-tƏ-RĪ′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>The derivation is from Latin notus, known, from which we also get
noted. It is an interesting characteristic of some words that a change
of syllables can alter the emotional impact. Thus, an admirer of certain
business executives will speak of them as “noted industrialists”; these
same people’s enemies will call them “notorious exploiters.” Similarly,
if we admire a man’s or a woman’s unworldliness, we refer to it by the
complimentary term childlike; but if we are annoyed by the trait, we
describe it, derogatively, as childish. Change “-like” to “-ish” and our
emotional tone undergoes a complete reversal.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>plenty of room at the top</li>
</ol>
<p>The top of a mountain is called, as you know, the summit, a word
derived from Latin summus, highest, which also gives us the mathematical
term sum, as in addition. A consummate artist has reached the very
highest point of perfection; and to consummate (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt) a
marriage, a business deal, or a contract is, etymologically, to bring it
to the highest point; that is, to put the final touches to it, to bring
it to completion.</p>
<p>[Note how differently consummate (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt), the adjective, is
pronounced from the verb to consummate (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt)].</p>
<p>Nouns are formed from adjectives by the addition of the noun suffix
-ness: sweet—sweetness; simple—simpleness; envious—enviousness; etc.</p>
<p>Many adjectives, however, have alternate noun forms, and the
adjective consummate is one of them. To make a noun out of consummate,
add either -ness or -acy; consummateness (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏt-nƏs) or
consummacy (KAHN′-sƏ-mƏ-see).</p>
<p>Verbs ending in -ate invariably tack on the noun suffix -ion to form
nouns: create—creation; evaluate—evaluation; etc.</p>
<p>Can you write the noun form of the verb to consummate?</p>
<hr />
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>no help</li>
</ol>
<p>Call people incorrigible (in-KAWR′-Ə-jƏ-bƏl) if they do anything to
excess, and if all efforts to correct or reform them are to no avail.
Thus, one can be an incorrigible idealist, an incorrigible criminal, an
incorrigible optimist, or an incorrigible philanderer. The word derives
from Latin corrigo, to correct or set straight, plus the negative prefix
in-. (This prefix, depending on the root it precedes, may be negative,
may intensify the root, as in invaluable, or may mean in.)</p>
<p>The noun is incorrigibility (in-kawr′-Ə-jƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee) or,
alternatively, incorrigibleness.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>veterans</li>
</ol>
<p>Inveterate, from Latin vetus, old,1 generally indicates
disapproval.</p>
<p>Inveterate gamblers have grown old in the habit, etymologically
speaking; inveterate drinkers have been imbibing for so long that they,
too, have formed old, well-established habits; and inveterate liars have
been lying for so long, and their habits are by now so deep-rooted, that
one can scarcely remember (the word implies) when they ever told the
truth.</p>
<p>The noun is inveteracy (in-VET′-Ər-Ə-see) or inveterateness.</p>
<p>A veteran (VET′-Ə-rƏn), as of the Armed Forces, grew older serving
the country; otherwise a veteran is an old hand at the game (and
therefore skillful). The word is both a noun and an adjective: a veteran
at (or in) swimming, tennis, police work, business, negotiations,
diplomacy—or a veteran actor, teacher, diplomat, political reformer.</p>

<li>birth</li>
</ol>
<p>Greek genesis, birth or origin, a root we discovered in discussing
psychogenic (Chapter 5), is the source of a great many English
words.</p>
<p>Genetics (jƏ-NET′-iks) is the science that treats of the transmission
of hereditary characteristics from parents to offspring. The scientist
specializing in the field is a geneticist (jƏ-NET′-Ə-sist), the
adjective is genetic (jƏ-NET′-ik). The particle in the chromosome of the
germ cell containing a hereditary characteristic is a gene (JEEN).</p>
<p>Genealogy (jeen′-ee-AL′-Ə-jee) is the study of family trees or
ancestral origins (logos, study). The practitioner is a genealogist
(jeen′-ee-AL′-Ə-jist). Can you form the adjective? __________________.
(And can you pronounce it?)</p>
<p>The genital (GEN′-Ə-tƏl), or sexual, organs are involved in the
process of conception and birth. The genesis (JEN′-Ə-sis) of anything—a
plan, idea, thought, career, etc.—is its beginning, birth, or origin,
and Genesis, the first book of the Old Testament, describes the
creation, or birth, of the universe.</p>
<p>Congenital is constructed by combining the prefix con-, with or
together, and the root genesis, birth.</p>
<p>So a congenital defect, deformity, condition, etc. occurs during the
nine-month birth process (or period of gestation, to become technical).
Hereditary (hƏ-RED′-Ə-tair′-ee) characteristics, on the other hand, are
acquired at the moment of conception. Thus, eye color, nose shape, hair
texture, and other such qualities are hereditary; they are determined by
the genes in the germ cells of the mother and father. But a thalidomide
baby resulted from the use of the drug by a pregnant woman, so the
deformities were congenital.</p>
<p>Congenital is used both literally and figuratively. Literally, the
word generally refers to some medical deformity or abnormality occurring
during gestation. Figuratively, it wildly exaggerates, for effect, the
very early existence of some quality: congenital liar, congenital fear
of the dark, etc.</p>

<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>of time and place</li>
</ol>
<p>A chronic liar lies constantly, again and again and again; a chronic
invalid is ill time after time, frequently, repeatedly. The derivation
of the word is Greek chronos, time. The noun form is chronicity
(krƏ-NIS′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>An anachronism (Ə-NAK′-rƏ-niz-Əm) is someone or something out of
time, out of date, belonging to a different era, either earlier or
later. (The prefix ana- like a-, is negative.) The adjective is
anachronous (Ə-NAK′-rƏ-nƏs) or anachronistic (Ə-nak′-rƏ-NIS′-tik).</p>
<p>Wander along Fifty-ninth Street and Central Park in Manhattan some
Sunday. You will see horse-drawn carriages with top-hatted coachmen—a
vestige of the 1800s. Surrounded by twentieth-century motorcars and
modern skyscrapers, these romantic vehicles of a bygone era are
anachronous.</p>
<p>Read a novel in which a scene is supposedly taking place in the
nineteenth century and see one of the characters turning on a TV set. An
anachronism!</p>
<p>Your friend talks, thinks, dresses, and acts as if he were living in
the time of Shakespeare. Another anachronism!</p>
<p>Science fiction is deliberately anachronous—it deals with phenomena,
gadgetry, accomplishments far off (possibly) in the future.</p>
<p>An anachronism is out of time; something out of place is incongruous
(in-KONG′-gr-Əs), a word combining the negative prefix in-, the prefix
con-, with or together, and a Latin verb meaning to agree or
correspond.</p>
<p>Thus, it is incongruous to wear a sweater and slacks to a formal
wedding; it is anachronous to wear the wasp waist, conspicuous bustle,
or powdered wig of the eighteenth century. The noun form of incongruous
is incongruity (in-kƏng-GR′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>Chronological (kron-Ə-LOJ′-Ə-kƏl), in correct time order, comes from
chronos. To tell a story chronologically is to relate the events in the
time order of their occurrence. Chronology (krƏ-NOL′-Ə-jee) is the
science of time order and the accurate dating of events (logos,
science)—the expert in this field is a chronologist (krƏ-NOL′-Ə-jist)—or
a list of events in the time order in which they have occurred or will
occur.</p>
<p>A chronometer (krƏ-NOM′-Ə-tƏr), combining chronos with metron,
measurement, is a highly accurate timepiece, especially one used on
ships. Chronometry (krƏ-NOM′-Ə-tree) is the measurement of time—the
adjective is chronometric (kron′-Ə-MET′-rik).</p>
<p>Add the prefix syn-, together, plus the verb suffix -ize, to chronos,
and you have constructed synchronize (SIN′-krƏ-nīz′), etymologically to
time together, or to move, happen, or cause to happen, at the same time
or rate. If you and your friend synchronize your watches, you set them
at the same time. If you synchronize the activity of your arms and legs,
as in swimming, you move them at the same time or rate. The adjective is
synchronous (SIN′-krƏ-nƏs); the noun form of the verb synchronize is
synchronization (sin′-krƏ-nƏ-ZAY′-shƏn).</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>disease, suffering, teeling</li>
</ol>
<p>Pathological is diseased (a pathological condition)—this meaning of
the word ignores the root logos, science, study.</p>
<p>Pathology (pƏ-THOL′-Ə-jee) is the science or study of disease—its
nature, cause, cure, etc. However, another meaning of the noun ignores
logos, and pathology may be any morbid, diseased, or abnormal physical
condition or conditions; in short, simply disease, as in “This case
involves so many kinds of pathology that several different specialists
are working on it.”</p>
<p>A pathologist (pƏ-THOL′-Ə-jist) is an expert who examines tissue,
often by autopsy or biopsy, to diagnose disease and interpret the
abnormalities in such tissue that may be caused by specific
diseases.</p>
<p>Pathos occurs in some English words with the additional meaning of
feeling. If you feel or suffer with someone, you are sympathetic
(sim-pƏ-THET′-ik)—sym- is a respelling before the letter p of the Greek
prefix syn-, with or together. The noun is sympathy (SIM′-pƏ-thee), the
verb sympathize (SIM′-pƏ-thīz). Husbands, for example, so the story
goes, may have sympathetic labor pains when their wives are about to
deliver.</p>
<p>The prefix anti-, you will recall, means against. If you experience
antipathy (an-TIP′-Ə-thee) to people or things, you feel against
them—you feel strong dislike or hostility. The adjective is antipathetic
(an′-tƏ-pƏ-THET′-ik), as in “an antipathetic reaction to an authority
figure.”</p>
<p>But you may have no feeling at all—just indifference, lack of any
interest, emotion, or response, complete listlessness, especially when
some reaction is normal or expected. Then you are apathetic
(ap-Ə-THET′-ik); a-, as you know, is a negative prefix. The noun is
apathy (AP′-Ə-thee), as in voter apathy, student apathy, etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you may be so sensitive or perceptive that you not
only share the feelings of another, but you also identify with those
feelings, in fact experience them yourself as if momentarily you were
that other person. What you have, then, is empathy (EM′-pƏ-thee); you
empathize (EM′-pƏ-thīz′), you are empathetic (em-pƏ-THET′-ik), or, to
use an alternate adjective, empathic (em-PATH′-ik). Em- is a respelling
before the letter p of the Greek prefix en-, in.</p>
<p>Someone is pathetic (pƏ-THET′-ik) who is obviously suffering—such a
person may arouse sympathy or pity (or perhaps antipathy?) in you. A
pathetic story is about suffering and, again, is likely to arouse
sadness, sorrow, or pity.</p>
<p>Some interesting research was done many years ago by Dr. J. B. Rhine
and his associates at Duke University on extrasensory perception; you
will find an interesting account of Rhine’s work in his book The Reach
of the Mind. What makes it possible for two people separated by miles of
space to communicate with each other without recourse to messenger,
telephone, telegraph, or postal service? It can be done, say the
believers in telepathy (tƏ-LEP′-Ə-thee), also called mental telepathy,
though they do not yet admit to knowing how. How can one person read the
mind of another? Simple—by being telepathic (tel-Ə-PATH′-ik), but no one
can explain the chemistry or biology of it. Telepathy is built by
combining pathos, feeling, with the prefix tele-, distance, the same
prefix we found in telephone, telegraph, telescope.</p>
<p>Telepathic (tel-Ə-PATH′-ik) communication occurs when people can feel
each other’s thoughts from a distance, when they have ESP.</p>

<p>SESSION 17</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>knowing</li>
</ol>
<p>Psychopaths commit antisocial and unconscionable acts—they are not
troubled by conscience, guilt, remorse, etc. over what they have
done.</p>
<p>Unconscionable and conscience are related in derivation—the first
word from Latin scio, to know, the second from Latin sciens, knowing,
and both using the prefix con-, with, together.</p>
<p>Etymologically, then, your conscience is your knowledge with a moral
sense of right and wrong; if you are unconscionable, your conscience is
not (un-) working, or you have no conscience. The noun form is
unconscionableness or unconscionability (un-kon′-shƏ-nƏ-BIL′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>Conscious, also from con- plus scio, is knowledge or awareness of
one’s emotions or sensations, or of what’s happening around one.</p>
<p>Science, from sciens, is systematized knowledge as opposed, for
example, to belief, faith, intuition, or guesswork.</p>
<p>Add Latin omnis, all, to sciens, to construct omniscient
(om-NISH′-Ənt), all-knowing, possessed of infinite knowledge. The noun
is omniscience (om-NISH′-Əns).</p>
<p>Add the prefix pre-, before, to sciens, to construct prescient
(PREE′-shƏnt)—knowing about events before they occur, i.e., psychic, or
possessed of unusual powers of prediction. The noun is prescience
(PREE′-shƏns).</p>
<p>And, finally, add the negative prefix ne- to sciens to produce
nescient (NESH′-Ənt), not knowing, or ignorant. Can you, by analogy with
the previous two words, write the noun form of nescient?
__________________. (Can you pronounce it?)</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>fool some of the people…</li>
</ol>
<p>Glib is from an old English root that means slippery. Glib liars or
glib talkers are smooth and slippery; they have ready answers, fluent
tongues, a persuasive air—but, such is the implication of the word, they
fool only the most nescient, for their smoothness lacks sincerity and
conviction.</p>
<p>The noun is glibness.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>herds and flocks</li>
</ol>
<p>Egregious (remember the pronunciation? Ə-GREE′-jƏs) is from Latin
grex, gregis, herd or flock. An egregious lie, act, crime, mistake, etc.
is so exceptionally vicious that it conspicuously stands out (e-, a
shortened form of the prefix ex-, out) from the herd or flock of other
bad things.</p>
<p>The noun is egregiousness (Ə-GREE′-jƏs-nƏs).</p>
<p>A person who enjoys companionship, who, etymologically, likes to be
with the herd, who reaches out for friends and is happiest when
surrounded by people—such a person is gregarious (grƏ-GAIR′-ee-Əs).</p>
<p>Extroverts are of course gregarious—they prefer human contact,
conversation, laughter, interrelationships, to solitude.</p>
<p>The suffix -ness, as you know, can be added to an adjective to
construct a noun form. Write the noun for gregarious:
__________________.</p>
<p>Add the prefix con-, with, together, to grex, gregis, to get the verb
congregate (KONG′-grƏ-gayt′); add the prefix se-, apart, to build the
verb segregate (SEG′-rƏ-gayt′); add the prefix ad-, to, toward (ad-
changes to ag- before a root starting with g-), to construct the verb
aggregate (AG-rƏ-gayt′).</p>
<p>Let’s see what we have. When people gather together in a herd or
flock, they (write the verb) __________________.</p>
<p>The noun is congregation (cong′-grƏ-GAY′-shƏn), one of the meanings
of which is a religious “flock.”</p>
<p>Put people or things apart from the herd, and you (write the verb)
__________________ them. Can you construct the noun by adding the
suitable noun suffix? __________________.</p>
<p>Bring individual items to or toward the herd or flock, and you (write
the verb) __________________ them. What is the noun form of this verb?
__________________.</p>
<p>The verb aggregate also means to come together to or toward the herd,
that is, to gather into a mass or whole, or by extension, to total or
amount to. So aggregate, another noun form, pronounced AG′-rƏ-gƏt, is a
group or mass of individuals considered as a whole, a herd, or a flock,
as in the phrase “people in the aggregate…”</p>

<p>TEASER QUESTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR ETYMOLOGIST</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>“She was one of many notables who attended the convention.”
Recognizing that the italicized word is built on the root notus, can you
define the noun notable in the context of known?
__________________</p></li>
<li><p>Notify and notice derive from the same root. Can you define these
two words, again in the context of known? Notify: __________________.
Notice:__________________. What do you supose the verb suffix -fy of
notify means? (Think also of simplify, clarify, liquefy, etc.)
__________________.</p></li>
<li><p>You are familiar with the roots chronos and graphein. Suppose you
came across the word chronograph in your reading. Can you make an
educated guess as to the meaning? __________________.</p></li>
<li><p>Recognizing the root genesis in the verb generate, how would you
define the word? __________________.</p></li>

<li>Recognizing the root omnis in omnipotent and omnipresent, can you
define the words?</li>

<p>Omnipotent: __________________.</p>
<p>Omnipresent: __________________.</p>
<p>Recalling how we formed a noun from the adjective omniscient, write
the noun forms of:</p>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18)</p>
<p>FOUR LASTING BENEFITS</p>
<p>You know by now that it is easy to build your vocabulary if you work
diligently and intelligently. Diligence is important—to come to the book
occasionally is to learn new words and ideas in an aimless fashion,
rather than in the continuous way that characterizes the natural,
uninterrupted, intellectual growth of a child. (You will recall that
children are top experts in increasing their vocabularies.) And an
intelligent approach is crucial—new words can be completely understood
and permanently remembered only as symbols of vital ideas, never if
memorized in long lists of isolated forms.</p>
<p>If you have worked diligently and intelligently, you have done much
more than merely learned a few hundred new words. Actually, I needn’t
tell you what else you’ve accomplished, since, if you really have
accomplished it, you can feel it for yourself; but it may be useful if I
verbalize the feelings you may have.</p>
<p>In addition to learning the meanings, pronunciation, background, and
use of 300–350 valuable words, you have:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Begun to sense a change in your intellectual atmosphere. (You
have begun to do your thinking with many of the words, with many of the
ideas behind the words. You have begun to use the words in your speech
and writing, and have become alert to their appearance in your
reading.)</p></li>
<li><p>Begun to develop a new interest in words as expressions of
ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>Begun to be aware of the new words you hear and that you see in
your reading.</p></li>
<li><p>Begun to gain a new feeling for the relationship between words.
(For you realize that many words are built on roots from other languages
and are related to other words which derive from the same
roots.)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Now, suppose we pause to see how successful your learning has
been.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, I offer you a comprehensive test on the first
part of your work.</p>
