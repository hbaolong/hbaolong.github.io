PERSONALITY TYPES</h4>
<p>(Sessions 1–3)</p>
<hr />
<p>TEASER PREVIEW</p>
<p>What word best describes your personality if you:</p>
<p>• are interested solely in your own welfare?</p>
<p>• constantly talk about yourself?</p>
<p>• dedicate your life to helping others?</p>
<p>• turn your mind inward?</p>
<p>• turn your mind outward?</p>
<p>• hate humanity?</p>
<p>• hate women?</p>
<p>• hate marriage?</p>
<p>• lead a lonely, austere existence?</p>
<hr />
<p>SESSION 1</p>
<p>Every human being is, in one way or another, unique.</p>
<p>Everyone’s personality is determined by a combination of genetic and
environmental factors.</p>
<p>Let us examine ten personality types (one of which might by chance be
your very own) that result from the way culture, growth, family
background, and environment interact with heredity.</p>
<p>And, of course, we begin not with the words, but with the ideas.</p>
<p>IDEAS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>me first</li>
</ol>
<p>Your attitude to life is simple, direct, and aboveboard—every
decision you make is based on the answer to one question: “What’s in it
for me?” If your selfishness, greed, and ruthless desire for
self-advancement hurt other people, that’s too bad. “This is a tough
world, pal, dog eat dog and all that, and I, for one, am not going to be
left behind!”</p>
<p>An egoist</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>the height of conceit</li>
</ol>
<p>“Now, let’s see. Have you heard about all the money I’m making? Did I
tell you about my latest amorous conquest? Let me give you my opinion—I
know, because I’m an expert at practically everything!” You are boastful
to the point of being obnoxious—you have only one string to your
conversational violin, namely, yourself; and on it you play a number of
monotonous variations: what you think, what you have done, how good you
are, how you would solve the problems of the world, etc. ad nauseam.</p>
<p>An egotist</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>let me help you</li>
</ol>
<p>You have discovered the secret of true happiness—concerning yourself
with the welfare of others. Never mind your own interests, how’s the
next fellow getting along?</p>
<p>An altruist</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>leave me alone</li>
</ol>
<p>Like a biochemist studying a colony of bacteria under the microscope,
you minutely examine your every thought, feeling, and action. Probing,
futile questions like “What do other people think of me?”, “How do I
look?”, and “Maybe I shouldn’t have said that?” are your constant
nagging companions, for you are unable to realize that other people do
not spend as much time and energy analyzing you as you think.</p>
<p>You may seem unsocial, yet your greatest desire is to be liked and
accepted. You may be shy and quiet, you are often moody and unhappy, and
you prefer solitude or at most the company of one person to a crowd. You
have an aptitude for creative work and are uncomfortable engaging in
activities that require cooperation with other people. You may even be a
genius, or eventually turn into one.</p>
<p>An introvert</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>let’s do it together</li>
</ol>
<p>You would be great as a teacher, counselor, administrator, insurance
agent. You can always become interested—sincerely, vitally interested—in
other people’s problems. You’re the life of the party, because you never
worry about the effect of your actions, never inhibit yourself with
doubts about dignity or propriety. You are usually happy, generally full
of high spirits; you love to be with people—lots of people. Your
thoughts, your interests, your whole personality are turned outward.</p>
<p>An extrovert</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>neither extreme</li>
</ol>
<p>You have both introverted and extroverted tendencies—at different
times and on different occasions. Your interests are turned, in about
equal proportions, both inward and outward. Indeed, you’re quite
normal—in the sense that your personality is like that of most
people.</p>
<p>An ambivert</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>people are no damn good</li>
</ol>
<p>Cynical, embittered, suspicious, you hate everyone. (Especially, but
never to be admitted, yourself?) The perfectibility of the human race?
“Nonsense! No way!” The stupidity, the meanness, and the crookedness of
most mortals (“Most? Probably all!”)—that is your favorite theme.</p>
<p>A misanthrope</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>women are no damn good</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometime in your dim past, you were crossed, scorned, or deeply
wounded by a woman (a mother, or mother figure, perhaps?). So now you
have a carefully constructed defense against further hurt—you hate all
women.</p>
<p>A misogynist</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>“marriage is an institution—and who wants to live in an
institution?”</li>
</ol>
<p>You will not make the ultimate legal commitment. Members of the
opposite sex are great as lovers, roommates, apartment- or
house-sharers, but not as lawfully wedded spouses. The ties that bind
are too binding for you. You may possibly believe, and possibly, for
yourself, be right, that a commitment is deeper and more meaningful if
freedom is available without judicial proceedings.</p>
<p>A misogamist</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>“… that the flesh is heir to …”</li>
</ol>
<p>Self-denial, austerity, lonely contemplation—these are the
characteristics of the good life, so you claim. The simplest food and
the least amount of it that will keep body and soul together, combined
with abstinence from fleshly, earthly pleasures, will eventually lead to
spiritual perfection—that is your philosophy.</p>
<p>An ascetic</p>
<p>USING THE WORDS</p>
<p>You have been introduced to ten valuable words—but in each case, as
you have noticed, you have first considered the ideas that these words
represent. Now say the words—each one is respelled phonetically so that
you will be sure to pronounce it correctly.1</p>
<p>Say each word aloud. This is the first important step to complete
mastery. As you hear a word in your own voice, think of its meaning. Are
you quite clear about it? If not, reinforce your learning by rereading
the explanatory paragraph or paragraphs.</p>
<p>Can you pronounce the words?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>egoist EE′-gō-ist</p></li>
<li><p>egotist EE′-gō-tist</p></li>
<li><p>altruist AL′-tr-ist</p></li>

<li><p>ambivert AM′-bƏ-vurt′</p></li>
<li><p>misanthrope MIS′-Ən-thrōp′</p></li>
<li><p>misogynist mƏ-SOJ′-Ə-nist</p></li>
<li><p>misogamist mƏ-SOG′-Ə-mist</p></li>
<li><p>ascetic Ə-SET′-ik</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Can you work with the words?</p>
<p>You have taken two long steps toward mastery of the expressive words
in this chapter—you have thought about the ideas behind them, and you
have said them aloud.</p>
<p>For your third step, match each personality with the appropriate
characteristic, action, or attitude.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>egoist a. turns thoughts inward</p></li>
<li><p>egotist b. hates marriage</p></li>
<li><p>altruist c. talks about accomplishments</p></li>
<li><p>introvert d. hates people</p></li>
<li><p>extrovert e. does not pursue pleasures of the flesh</p></li>
<li><p>ambivert f. is interested in the welfare of others</p></li>
<li><p>misanthrope g. believes in self-advancement</p></li>
<li><p>misogynist h. turns thoughts both inward and outward</p></li>
<li><p>misogamist i. hates women</p></li>
<li><p>ascetic j. turns thoughts outward</p></li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p>KEY: 1–g, 2–c, 3–f, 4–a, 5–j, 6–h, 7–d, 8–i, 9–b, 10–e</p>
<hr />
<p>Do you understand the words?</p>
<p>Now that you are becoming more and more involved in these ten words,
find out if they can make an immediate appeal to your understanding.
Here are ten questions—can you indicate, quickly, and without reference
to any previous definitions, whether the correct answer to each of these
questions is yes or no?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is an egoist selfish?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Is modesty one of the characteristics of the egotist?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Is an altruist selfish?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>Does an introvert pay much attention to himself?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li>Does an extrovert prefer solitude to companionship?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Are most normal people ambiverts?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="7" type="1">
<li>Does a misanthrope like people?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li>Does a misogynist enjoy the company of women?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li>Does an ascetic lead a life of luxury?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>Does a misogamist try to avoid marriage?</li>
</ol>
<p>YES NO</p>
<hr />
<p>KEY: 1–yes, 2–no, 3–no, 4–yes, 5–no, 6–yes, 7– no, 8–no, 9–no,
10–yes</p>
<hr />
<p>Can you recall the words?</p>
<p>You have thus far reinforced your learning by saying the words aloud,
by matching them to their definitions, and by responding to meaning when
they were used in context.</p>
<p>Can you recall each word, now, without further reference to previous
material? And can you spell it correctly?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Who lives a lonely, austere life?</p></li>
<li><p>A_________________</p></li>
<li><p>Whose interests are turned outward?</p></li>

<hr />
<p>(End of Session 1)</p>
<p>SESSION 2</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<p>Every word in the English language has a history—and these ten are no
exception. In this section you will learn a good deal more about the
words you have been working with; in addition, you will make excursions
into many other words allied either in meaning, form, or history to our
basic ten.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the ego</li>
</ol>
<p>Egoist and egotist are built on the same Latin root—the pronoun ego,
meaning I. I is the greatest concern in the egoist’s mind, the most
overused word in the egotist’s vocabulary. (Keep the words
differentiated in your own mind by thinking of the t in talk, and the
additional t in egotist.) Ego itself has been taken over from Latin as
an important English word and is commonly used to denote one’s concept
of oneself, as in, “What do you think your constant criticisms do to my
ego?” Ego has also a special meaning in psychology—but for the moment
you have enough problems without going into that.</p>
<p>If you are an egocentric (ee′-gō-SEN′-trik), you consider yourself
the center of the universe—you are an extreme form of the egoist. And if
you are an egomaniac (ee′-gō-MAY′-nee-ak), you carry egoism to such an
extreme that your needs, desires, and interests have become a morbid
obsession, a mania. The egoist or egotist is obnoxious, the egocentric
is intolerable, and the egomaniac is dangerous and slightly mad.</p>
<p>Egocentric is both a noun (“What an egocentric her new roommate is!”)
and an adjective (“He is the most egocentric person I have ever
met!”).</p>
<p>To derive the adjective form of egomaniac, add -al, a common
adjective suffix. Say the adjective aloud:</p>
<p>egomaniacal ee′-gō-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>others</li>
</ol>
<p>In Latin, the word for other is alter, and a number of valuable
English words are built on this root.</p>
<p>Altruism (AL′-tr-iz-Əm), the philosophy practiced by altruists, comes
from one of the variant spellings of Latin alter, other. Altruistic
(al-tr-IS′-tik) actions look toward the benefit of others. If you
alternate (AWL′-tƏr-nayt′), you skip one and take the other, so to
speak, as when you play golf on alternate (AWL′-tƏr-nƏt) Saturdays.</p>
<p>An alternate (AWL′-tƏr-nƏt) in a debate, contest, or convention is
the other person who will take over if the original choice is unable to
attend. And if you have no alternative (awl-TUR′-nƏ-tiv), you have no
other choice.</p>
<p>You see how easy it is to understand the meanings of these words once
you realize that they all come from the same source. And keeping in mind
that alter means other, you can quickly understand words like alter ego,
altercation, and alteration.</p>
<p>An alteration (awl′-tƏ-RAY′-shƏn) is of course a change—a making into
something other. When you alter (AWL′-tƏr) your plans, you make other
plans.</p>
<p>An altercation (awl′-tƏr-KAY′-shƏn) is a verbal dispute. When you
have an altercation with someone, you have a violent disagreement, a
“fight” with words. And why? Because you have other ideas, plans, or
opinions than those of the person on the other side of the argument.
Altercation, by the way, is stronger than quarrel or dispute—the
sentiment is more heated, the disagreement is likely to be angry or even
hot-tempered, there may be recourse, if the disputants are human, to
profanity or obscenity. You have altercations, in short, over pretty
important issues, and the word implies that you get quite excited.</p>
<p>Alter ego (AWL′-tƏr EE′-gō), which combines alter, other, with ego,
I, self, generally refers to someone with whom you are so close that you
both do the same things, think alike, react similarly, and are, in
temperament, almost mirror images of each other. Any such friend is your
other I, your other self, your alter ego.</p>
<p>USING THE WORDS</p>
<p>Can you pronounce the words?</p>
<p>Digging a little into the derivation of three of our basic words,
egoist, egotist, and altruist, has put us in touch with two important
Latin roots, ego, I, self, and alter, other, and has made it possible
for us to explore, with little difficulty, many other words derived from
these roots. Pause now, for a moment, to digest these new acquisitions,
and to say them aloud.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>ego EE′-gō</p></li>
<li><p>egocentric ee-gō-SEN′-trik</p></li>
<li><p>egomaniac ee-gō-MAY′-nee-ak</p></li>
<li><p>egomaniacal ee′-gō-mƏ-NĪ′-Ə-kƏl</p></li>
<li><p>altruism AL′-tr-iz-Əm</p></li>
<li><p>altruistic al-tr-IS′-tik</p></li>
<li><p>to alternate (v.) AWL′-tƏr-nayt′</p></li>
<li><p>alternate (adj. or noun) AWL′-tƏr-nƏt</p></li>
<li><p>alternative awl-TUR′-nƏ-tiv</p></li>
<li><p>alteration awl′-tƏr-AY′-shƏn</p></li>
<li><p>to alter AWL′-tƏr</p></li>
<li><p>altercation awl′-tƏr-KAY′-shƏn</p></li>
<li><p>alter ego AWL′-tƏr EE′-gō</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Can you work with the words? (I)</p>
<p>You have seen how these thirteen words derive from the two Latin
roots ego, I, self, and alter, other, and you have pronounced them aloud
and thereby begun to make them part of your active vocabulary.</p>
<p>Are you ready to match definitions to words?</p>

etc.</p></li>

<p>SESSION 3</p>
<p>ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>depends how you turn</li>
</ol>
<p>Introvert, extrovert, and ambivert are built on the Latin verb verto,
to turn. If your thoughts are constantly turned inward (intro-), you are
an introvert; outward (extro-), an extrovert; and in both directions
(ambi-), an ambivert. The prefix ambi-, both, is also found in
ambidextrous (am′-bƏ-DEKS′-trƏs), able to use both hands with equal
skill. The noun is ambidexterity (am′-bƏ-deks-TAIR′-Ə-tee).</p>
<p>Dexterous (DEKS′-trƏs) means skillful, the noun dexterity
(deks-TAIR′-Ə-tee) is skill. The ending -ous is a common adjective
suffix (famous, dangerous, perilous, etc.); -ity is a common noun suffix
(vanity, quality, simplicity, etc.).</p>
<p>(Spelling caution: Note that the letter following the t- in
ambidextrous is -r, but that in dexterous the next letter is -e.)</p>
<p>Dexter is actually the Latin word for right hand—in the ambidextrous
person, both hands are right hands, so to speak.</p>
<p>The right hand is traditionally the more skillful one; it is only
within recent decades that we have come to accept that “lefties” or
“southpaws” are just as normal as anyone else—and the term left-handed
is still used as a synonym of awkward.</p>
<p>The Latin word for the left hand is sinister. This same word, in
English, means threatening, evil, or dangerous, a further commentary on
our early suspiciousness of left-handed persons. There may still be some
parents who insist on forcing left-handed children to change (though
left-handedness is inherited, and as much an integral part of its
possessor as eye color or nose shape), with various unfortunate results
to the child—sometimes stuttering or an inability to read with normal
skill.</p>
<p>The French word for the left hand is gauche, and, as you would
suspect, when we took this word over into English we invested it with an
uncomplimentary meaning. Call someone gauche (GŌSH) and you imply
clumsiness, generally social rather than physical. (We’re right back to
our age-old misconception that left-handed people are less skillful than
right-handed ones.) A gauche remark is tactless; a gauche offer of
sympathy is so bumbling as to be embarrassing; gaucherie (GŌ′-shƏ-ree)
is an awkward, clumsy, tactless, embarrassing way of saying things or of
handling situations. The gauche person is totally without finesse.</p>
<p>And the French word for the right hand is droit, which we have used
in building our English word adroit (Ə-DROYT′). Needless to say, adroit,
like dexterous, means skillful, but especially in the exercise of the
mental facilities. Like gauche, adroit, or its noun adroitness, usually
is used figuratively. The adroit person is quickwitted, can get out of
difficult spots cleverly, can handle situations ingeniously. Adroitness
is, then, quite the opposite of gaucherie.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>love, hate, and marriage</li>
</ol>
<p>Misanthrope, misogynist, and misogamist are built on the Greek root
misein, to hate. The misanthrope hates mankind (Greek anthropos,
mankind); the misogynist hates women (Greek gyne, woman); the misogamist
hates marriage (Greek gamos, marriage).</p>
<p>Anthropos, mankind, is also found in anthropology
(an-thrƏ-POL′-Ə-jee), the study of the development of the human race;
and in philanthropist (fƏ-LAN′-thrƏ-pist), one who loves mankind and
shows such love by making substantial financial contributions to
charitable organizations or by donating time and energy to helping those
in need.</p>
<p>The root gyne, woman, is also found in gynecologist
(gīn-Ə-KOL′-Ə-jist or jīn-KOL′-Ə-jist), the medical specialist who
treats female disorders. And the root gamos, marriage, occurs also in
monogamy (mƏ-NOG′-Ə-mee), bigamy (BIG′-Ə-mee), and polygamy
(pƏ-LIG′-Ə-mee).</p>
<p>(As we will discover later, monos means one, bi- means two, polys
means many.)</p>
<p>So monogamy is the custom of only one marriage (at a time).</p>
<p>Bigamy, by etymology, is two marriages—in actuality, the unlawful act
of contracting another marriage without divorcing one’s current legal
spouse.</p>
<p>And polygamy, by derivation many marriages, and therefore
etymologically denoting plural marriage for either males or females, in
current usage generally refers to the custom practiced in earlier times
by the Mormons, and before them by King Solomon, in which the man has as
many wives as he can afford financially and/or emotionally. The correct,
but rarely used, term for this custom is polygyny (pƏ-LIJ′-Ə-nee)—polys,
many, plus gyne, woman.</p>
<p>What if a woman has two or more husbands, a form of marriage
practiced in the Himalaya Mountains of Tibet? That custom is called
polyandry (pol-ee-AN′-dree), from polys plus Greek andros, male.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>making friends with suffixes</li>
</ol>
<p>English words have various forms, using certain suffixes for nouns
referring to persons, other suffixes for practices, attitudes,
philosophies, etc, and still others for adjectives.</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p>Person Practice, etc. Adjective</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>misanthrope or misanthropist misanthropy misanthropic</p></li>
<li><p>misogynist misogyny misogynous or misogynistic</p></li>
<li><p>gynecologist gynecology gynecological</p></li>
<li><p>monogamist monogamy monogamous</p></li>
<li><p>bigamist bigamy bigamous</p></li>
<li><p>polygamist polygamy polygamous</p></li>
<li><p>polygynist polygyny polygynous</p></li>
<li><p>polyandrist polyandry polyandrous</p></li>
<li><p>philanthropist philanthropy philanthropic</p></li>
<li><p>anthropologist anthropology anthropological</p></li>
</ol>
<p>You will note, then, that -ist is a common suffix for a person; -y
for a practice, attitude, etc.; and -ic or -ous for an adjective.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>living alone and liking it</li>
</ol>
<p>Ascetic is from the Greek word asketes, monk or hermit.</p>
<p>A monk lives a lonely life—not for him the pleasures of the
fleshpots, the laughter and merriment of convivial gatherings, the
dissipation of high living. Rather, days of contemplation, study, and
rough toil, nights on a hard bed in a simple cell, and the kind of
self-denial that leads to a purification of the soul.</p>
<p>That person is an ascetic who leads an existence, voluntarily of
course, that compares in austerity, simplicity, and rigorous hardship
with the life of a monk.</p>
<p>The practice is asceticism (Ə-SET′-Ə-siz-Əm), the adjective
ascetic.</p>

<p>(Answers in Chapter 18.)</p>
<p>STICK TO YOUR TIME SCHEDULE!</p>
<p>In three sessions, you have become acquainted with scores of new,
vital, exciting words. You understand the ideas behind these words,
their various forms and spellings, their pronunciation, their
derivation, how they can be used, and exactly what they mean. I do not
wish to press a point unduly, but it is possible that you have learned
more new words in the short time it took you to cover this chapter than
the average adult learns in an entire year. This realization should make
you feel both gratified and excited.</p>
<p>Funny thing about time. Aside from the fact that we all, rich or
poor, sick or well, have the same amount of time, exactly twenty-four
hours every day (that is looking at time from a static point of view),
it is also true that we can always find time for the things we enjoy
doing, almost never for the things we find unpleasant (and that is
looking at time from the dynamic point of view). I am not merely being
philosophical—I am sure you will agree with this concept if you give it
a little thought.</p>
<p>If you have enjoyed learning new words, accepting new challenges,
gaining new understanding, and discovering the thrill of successful
accomplishment, then make sure to stay with the time schedule you have
set up for yourself.</p>
<p>A crucial factor in successful, ongoing learning is routine.</p>
<p>Develop a comfortable time routine, persevere against all
distractions, and you will learn anything you sincerely want to
learn.</p>
<p>So, to give yourself an edge, write here the day and hour you plan to
return to your work:</p>

<p>Brief Intermission One</p>
<p>TEST YOUR GRAMMAR</p>
<p>How good is your English? Have you ever said me and then wondered if
it shouldn’t have been I—or vice versa? Do you sometimes get a little
confused about lay and lie or who and whom? Perhaps you are often a
little less than certain about the distinction between effect and
affect, principal and principle, childish and childlike?</p>
<p>Here is a series of quick tests that will show you how skillful you
are in using the right word in the right place, that will give you a
reliable indication of how your language ability compares with the
average.</p>
<p>TEST I—EASY</p>
<p>If your English is every bit as good as average, you will have no
difficulty making a proper choice in at least eight of the following ten
sentences.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There is a beautiful moon out tonight and Estelle and I are going
for a stroll—would you like to come along with (she and I, her and
me?)</p></li>
<li><p>Your husband doesn’t believe that you are older than (I,
me).</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe we’re not as rich as (they, them), but I bet we’re a lot
happier.</p></li>
<li><p>Does your child still (lay, lie) down for a nap after
lunch?</p></li>
<li><p>When we saw Mary openly flirting with Nellie’s husband, we
(could, couldn’t) hardly believe our eyes.</p></li>
<li><p>You should (of, have) put more vermouth into the
martini.</p></li>
<li><p>Does your company (leave, let) you have as long a lunch break as
you would like?</p></li>
<li><p>Harriet feels that her (brothers-in-law, brother-in-laws) are
impossible to get along with.</p></li>
<li><p>“What (kind of, kind of a) car are you looking for?” asked the
salesman.</p></li>
<li><p>Mrs. White was delighted that the Fennells had invited John and
(she, her) to their party.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Is your English up to par? HERE ARE THE CORRECT ANSWERS</p>
<p>1–her and me, 2–I, 3-they, 4–lie, 5–could, 6–have, 7–let,
8–brothers-in-law, 9–kind of, 10–her</p>
<p>TEST II—HARDER</p>
<p>Choose correctly in at least seven of the following problems to
consider that your skill is distinctly above average—get all ten right
to conclude that you rarely, if ever, make an error in grammar.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>What (effect, affect) has the new administration’s policies had
on investor confidence?</p></li>
<li><p>A feeling of one’s worth is one of the (principle, principal)
goals of psychological therapy.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s no sense (in, of) carrying on that way.</p></li>
<li><p>I can’t remember (who, whom) it was.</p></li>
<li><p>The infant (lay, laid) quietly sucking its thumb.</p></li>
<li><p>No one but (she, her) ever made a perfect score on the
test.</p></li>
<li><p>In the early days of frontier history, horse thieves were
(hanged, hung).</p></li>
<li><p>Neither of your responses (are, is) satisfactory.</p></li>
<li><p>Either of these two small cars, if properly maintained, (is, are)
sure to give over thirty miles per gallon in highway driving.</p></li>
<li><p>Tell (whoever, whomever) is waiting to come in.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Is your English above average? HERE ARE THE CORRECT ANSWERS</p>
<p>1–effect, 2–principal, 3–in, 4–who, 5–lay, 6–her, 7–hanged, 8–is,
9–is, 10–whoever</p>
<p>TEST III—HARDEST</p>
<p>Now you can discover how close you are to being an expert in English.
The next ten sentences are no cinch—you will be acquitting yourself
creditably if you check the correct word five times out of ten. And you
have every right to consider yourself an expert if you get nine or ten
right.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We have just interviewed an applicant (who, whom) the committee
believes is best qualified for the position.</p></li>
<li><p>She is one of those gifted writers who (turns, turn) out one best
seller after another.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t sound so (incredulous, incredible); what I am saying is
absolutely true.</p></li>
<li><p>We were totally (disinterested, uninterested) in the
offer.</p></li>
<li><p>This recipe calls for two (cupsful, cupfuls) of sugar.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you trying to (infer, imply) by those words that he is not to
be trusted?</p></li>
<li><p>We thought the actress to be (she, her), but we weren’t
sure.</p></li>
<li><p>Was it (she, her) you were talking about?</p></li>
<li><p>Your criteria (is, are) not valid.</p></li>
<li><p>“It is I who (is, am) the only friend you’ve got,” she told him
pointedly.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Are you an expert? HERE ARE THE CORRECT ANSWERS</p>
<p>1–who, 2–turn, 3–incredulous, 4–uninterested, 5–cupfuls, 6–imply,
7–her, 8–she, 9–are, 10–am</p>
