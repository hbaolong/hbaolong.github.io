<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>
<p>How This Book Came to Be</p>
<p>In the early summer of 2004, I got a phone call from Steve Jobs. He
had been scattershot friendly to me over the years, with occasional
bursts of intensity, especially when he was launching a new product that
he wanted on the cover of Time or featured on CNN, places where I’d
worked. But now that I was no longer at either of those places, I hadn’t
heard from him much. We talked a bit about the Aspen Institute, which I
had recently joined, and I invited him to speak at our summer campus in
Colorado. He’d be happy to come, he said, but not to be onstage. He
wanted instead to take a walk so that we could talk.</p>
<p>That seemed a bit odd. I didn’t yet know that taking a long walk was
his preferred way to have a serious conversation. It turned out that he
wanted me to write a biography of him. I had recently published one on
Benjamin Franklin and was writing one about Albert Einstein, and my
initial reaction was to wonder, half jokingly, whether he saw himself as
the natural successor in that sequence. Because I assumed that he was
still in the middle of an oscillating career that had many more ups and
downs left, I demurred. Not now, I said. Maybe in a decade or two, when
you retire.</p>
<p>I had known him since 1984, when he came to Manhattan to have lunch
with Time’s editors and extol his new Macintosh. He was petulant even
then, attacking a Time correspondent for having wounded him with a story
that was too revealing. But talking to him afterward, I found myself
rather captivated, as so many others have been over the years, by his
engaging intensity. We stayed in touch, even after he was ousted from
Apple. When he had something to pitch, such as a NeXT computer or Pixar
movie, the beam of his charm would suddenly refocus on me, and he would
take me to a sushi restaurant in Lower Manhattan to tell me that
whatever he was touting was the best thing he had ever produced. I liked
him.</p>
<p>When he was restored to the throne at Apple, we put him on the cover
of Time, and soon thereafter he began offering me his ideas for a series
we were doing on the most influential people of the century. He had
launched his “Think Different” campaign, featuring iconic photos of some
of the same people we were considering, and he found the endeavor of
assessing historic influence fascinating.</p>
<p>After I had deflected his suggestion that I write a biography of him,
I heard from him every now and then. At one point I emailed to ask if it
was true, as my daughter had told me, that the Apple logo was an homage
to Alan Turing, the British computer pioneer who broke the German
wartime codes and then committed suicide by biting into a cyanide-laced
apple. He replied that he wished he had thought of that, but hadn’t.
That started an exchange about the early history of Apple, and I found
myself gathering string on the subject, just in case I ever decided to
do such a book. When my Einstein biography came out, he came to a book
event in Palo Alto and pulled me aside to suggest, again, that he would
make a good subject.</p>
<p>His persistence baffled me. He was known to guard his privacy, and I
had no reason to believe he’d ever read any of my books. Maybe someday,
I continued to say. But in 2009 his wife, Laurene Powell, said bluntly,
“If you’re ever going to do a book on Steve, you’d better do it now.” He
had just taken a second medical leave. I confessed to her that when he
had first raised the idea, I hadn’t known he was sick. Almost nobody
knew, she said. He had called me right before he was going to be
operated on for cancer, and he was still keeping it a secret, she
explained.</p>
<p>I decided then to write this book. Jobs surprised me by readily
acknowledging that he would have no control over it or even the right to
see it in advance. “It’s your book,” he said. “I won’t even read it.”
But later that fall he seemed to have second thoughts about cooperating
and, though I didn’t know it, was hit by another round of cancer
complications. He stopped returning my calls, and I put the project
aside for a while.</p>
<p>Then, unexpectedly, he phoned me late on the afternoon of New Year’s
Eve 2009. He was at home in Palo Alto with only his sister, the writer
Mona Simpson. His wife and their three children had taken a quick trip
to go skiing, but he was not healthy enough to join them. He was in a
reflective mood, and we talked for more than an hour. He began by
recalling that he had wanted to build a frequency counter when he was
twelve, and he was able to look up Bill Hewlett, the founder of HP, in
the phone book and call him to get parts. Jobs said that the past twelve
years of his life, since his return to Apple, had been his most
productive in terms of creating new products. But his more important
goal, he said, was to do what Hewlett and his friend David Packard had
done, which was create a company that was so imbued with innovative
creativity that it would outlive them.</p>
<p>“I always thought of myself as a humanities person as a kid, but I
liked electronics,” he said. “Then I read something that one of my
heroes, Edwin Land of Polaroid, said about the importance of people who
could stand at the intersection of humanities and sciences, and I
decided that’s what I wanted to do.” It was as if he were suggesting
themes for his biography (and in this instance, at least, the theme
turned out to be valid). The creativity that can occur when a feel for
both the humanities and the sciences combine in one strong personality
was the topic that most interested me in my biographies of Franklin and
Einstein, and I believe that it will be a key to creating innovative
economies in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p>I asked Jobs why he wanted me to be the one to write his biography.
“I think you’re good at getting people to talk,” he replied. That was an
unexpected answer. I knew that I would have to interview scores of
people he had fired, abused, abandoned, or otherwise infuriated, and I
feared he would not be comfortable with my getting them to talk. And
indeed he did turn out to be skittish when word trickled back to him of
people that I was interviewing. But after a couple of months, he began
encouraging people to talk to me, even foes and former girlfriends. Nor
did he try to put anything offlimits. “I’ve done a lot of things I’m not
proud of, such as getting my girlfriend pregnant when I was twenty-three
and the way I handled that,” he said. “But I don’t have any skeletons in
my closet that can’t be allowed out.” He didn’t seek any control over
what I wrote, or even ask to read it in advance. His only involvement
came when my publisher was choosing the cover art. When he saw an early
version of a proposed cover treatment, he disliked it so much that he
asked to have input in designing a new version. I was both amused and
willing, so I readily assented.</p>
<p>I ended up having more than forty interviews and conversations with
him. Some were formal ones in his Palo Alto living room, others were
done during long walks and drives or by telephone. During my two years
of visits, he became increasingly intimate and revealing, though at
times I witnessed what his veteran colleagues at Apple used to call his
“reality distortion field.” Sometimes it was the inadvertent misfiring
of memory cells that happens to us all; at other times he was spinning
his own version of reality both to me and to himself. To check and flesh
out his story, I interviewed more than a hundred friends, relatives,
competitors, adversaries, and colleagues.</p>
<p>His wife also did not request any restrictions or control, nor did
she ask to see in advance what I would publish. In fact she strongly
encouraged me to be honest about his failings as well as his strengths.
She is one of the smartest and most grounded people I have ever met.
“There are parts of his life and personality that are extremely messy,
and that’s the truth,” she told me early on. “You shouldn’t whitewash
it. He’s good at spin, but he also has a remarkable story, and I’d like
to see that it’s all told truthfully.”</p>
<p>I leave it to the reader to assess whether I have succeeded in this
mission. I’m sure there are players in this drama who will remember some
of the events differently or think that I sometimes got trapped in
Jobs’s distortion field. As happened when I wrote a book about Henry
Kissinger, which in some ways was good preparation for this project, I
found that people had such strong positive and negative emotions about
Jobs that the Rashomon effect was often evident. But I’ve done the best
I can to balance conflicting accounts fairly and be transparent about
the sources I used.</p>
<p>This is a book about the roller-coaster life and searingly intense
personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and
ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers,
animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital
publishing. You might even add a seventh, retail stores, which Jobs did
not quite revolutionize but did reimagine. In addition, he opened the
way for a new market for digital content based on apps rather than just
websites. Along the way he produced not only transforming products but
also, on his second try, a lasting company, endowed with his DNA, that
is filled with creative designers and daredevil engineers who could
carry forward his vision. In August 2011, right before he stepped down
as CEO, the enterprise he started in his parents’ garage became the
world’s most valuable company.</p>
<p>This is also, I hope, a book about innovation. At a time when the
United States is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when
societies around the world are trying to build creative digital-age
economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness,
imagination, and sustained innovation. He knew that the best way to
create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with
technology, so he built a company where leaps of the imagination were
combined with remarkable feats of engineering. He and his colleagues at
Apple were able to think differently: They developed not merely modest
product advances based on focus groups, but whole new devices and
services that consumers did not yet know they needed.</p>
<p>He was not a model boss or human being, tidily packaged for
emulation. Driven by demons, he could drive those around him to fury and
despair. But his personality and passions and products were all
interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if
part of an integrated system. His tale is thus both instructive and
cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership,
and values.</p>
<p>Shakespeare’s Henry V—the story of a willful and immature prince who
becomes a passionate but sensitive, callous but sentimental, inspiring
but flawed king—begins with the exhortation “O for a Muse of fire, that
would ascend / The brightest heaven of invention.” For Steve Jobs, the
ascent to the brightest heaven of invention begins with a tale of two
sets of parents, and of growing up in a valley that was just learning
how to turn silicon into gold.</p>
