SECOND COMING</h4>
<p>What Rough Beast, Its Hour Come Round at Last . . .</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, 1996</p>
<p>Things Fall Apart</p>
<p>When Jobs unveiled the NeXT computer in 1988, there was a burst of
excitement. That fizzled when the computer finally went on sale the
following year. Jobs’s ability to dazzle, intimidate, and spin the press
began to fail him, and there was a series of stories on the company’s
woes. “NeXT is incompatible with other computers at a time when the
industry is moving toward interchangeable systems,” Bart Ziegler of
Associated Press reported. “Because relatively little software exists to
run on NeXT, it has a hard time attracting customers.”</p>
<p>NeXT tried to reposition itself as the leader in a new category,
personal workstations, for people who wanted the power of a workstation
and the friendliness of a personal computer. But those customers were by
now buying them from fast-growing Sun Microsystems. Revenues for NeXT in
1990 were 8 million; Sun made .5 billion that year. IBM abandoned its
deal to license the NeXT software, so Jobs was forced to do something
against his nature: Despite his ingrained belief that hardware and
software should be integrally linked, he agreed in January 1992 to
license the NeXTSTEP operating system to run on other computers.</p>
<p>One surprising defender of Jobs was Jean-Louis Gassée, who had bumped
elbows with Jobs when he replaced him at Apple and subsequently been
ousted himself. He wrote an article extolling the creativity of NeXT
products. “NeXT might not be Apple,” Gassée argued, “but Steve is still
Steve.” A few days later his wife answered a knock on the door and went
running upstairs to tell him that Jobs was standing there. He thanked
Gassée for the article and invited him to an event where Intel’s Andy
Grove would join Jobs in announcing that NeXTSTEP would be ported to the
IBM/Intel platform. “I sat next to Steve’s father, Paul Jobs, a movingly
dignified individual,” Gassée recalled. “He raised a difficult son, but
he was proud and happy to see him onstage with Andy Grove.”</p>
<p>A year later Jobs took the inevitable subsequent step: He gave up
making the hardware altogether. This was a painful decision, just as it
had been when he gave up making hardware at Pixar. He cared about all
aspects of his products, but the hardware was a particular passion. He
was energized by great design, obsessed over manufacturing details, and
would spend hours watching his robots make his perfect machines. But now
he had to lay off more than half his workforce, sell his beloved factory
to Canon (which auctioned off the fancy furniture), and satisfy himself
with a company that tried to license an operating system to
manufacturers of uninspired machines.</p>
<p>By the mid-1990s Jobs was finding some pleasure in his new family
life and his astonishing triumph in the movie business, but he despaired
about the personal computer industry. “Innovation has virtually ceased,”
he told Gary Wolf of Wired at the end of 1995. “Microsoft dominates with
very little innovation. Apple lost. The desktop market has entered the
dark ages.”</p>
<p>He was also gloomy in an interview with Tony Perkins and the editors
of Red Herring. First, he displayed the “Bad Steve” side of his
personality. Soon after Perkins and his colleagues arrived, Jobs slipped
out the back door “for a walk,” and he didn’t return for forty-five
minutes. When the magazine’s photographer began taking pictures, he
snapped at her sarcastically and made her stop. Perkins later noted,
“Manipulation, selfishness, or downright rudeness, we couldn’t figure
out the motivation behind his madness.” When he finally settled down for
the interview, he said that even the advent of the web would do little
to stop Microsoft’s domination. “Windows has won,” he said. “It beat the
Mac, unfortunately, it beat UNIX, it beat OS/2. An inferior product
won.”</p>
<p>Apple Falling</p>
<p>For a few years after Jobs was ousted, Apple was able to coast
comfortably with a high profit margin based on its temporary dominance
in desktop publishing. Feeling like a genius back in 1987, John Sculley
had made a series of proclamations that nowadays sound embarrassing.
Jobs wanted Apple “to become a wonderful consumer products company,”
Sculley wrote. “This was a lunatic plan. . . . Apple would never be a
consumer products company. . . . We couldn’t bend reality to all our
dreams of changing the world. . . . High tech could not be designed and
sold as a consumer product.”</p>
<p>Jobs was appalled, and he became angry and contemptuous as Sculley
presided over a steady decline in market share for Apple in the early
1990s. “Sculley destroyed Apple by bringing in corrupt people and
corrupt values,” Jobs later lamented. “They cared about making money—for
themselves mainly, and also for Apple—rather than making great
products.” He felt that Sculley’s drive for profits came at the expense
of gaining market share. “Macintosh lost to Microsoft because Sculley
insisted on milking all the profits he could get rather than improving
the product and making it affordable.” As a result, the profits
eventually disappeared.</p>
<p>It had taken Microsoft a few years to replicate Macintosh’s graphical
user interface, but by 1990 it had come out with Windows 3.0, which
began the company’s march to dominance in the desktop market. Windows
95, which was released in 1995, became the most successful operating
system ever, and Macintosh sales began to collapse. “Microsoft simply
ripped off what other people did,” Jobs later said. “Apple deserved it.
After I left, it didn’t invent anything new. The Mac hardly improved. It
was a sitting duck for Microsoft.”</p>
<p>His frustration with Apple was evident when he gave a talk to a
Stanford Business School club at the home of a student, who asked him to
sign a Macintosh keyboard. Jobs agreed to do so if he could remove the
keys that had been added to the Mac after he left. He pulled out his car
keys and pried off the four arrow cursor keys, which he had once banned,
as well as the top row of F1, F2, F3 . . . function keys. “I’m changing
the world one keyboard at a time,” he deadpanned. Then he signed the
mutilated keyboard.</p>
<p>During his 1995 Christmas vacation in Kona Village, Hawaii, Jobs went
walking along the beach with his friend Larry Ellison, the irrepressible
Oracle chairman. They discussed making a takeover bid for Apple and
restoring Jobs as its head. Ellison said he could line up billion in
financing: “I will buy Apple, you will get 25% of it right away for
being CEO, and we can restore it to its past glory.” But Jobs demurred.
“I decided I’m not a hostile-takeover kind of guy,” he explained. “If
they had asked me to come back, it might have been different.”</p>
<p>By 1996 Apple’s share of the market had fallen to 4% from a high of
16% in the late 1980s. Michael Spindler, the German-born chief of
Apple’s European operations who had replaced Sculley as CEO in 1993,
tried to sell the company to Sun, IBM, and Hewlett-Packard. That failed,
and he was ousted in February 1996 and replaced by Gil Amelio, a
research engineer who was CEO of National Semiconductor. During his
first year the company lost billion, and the stock price, which had been
0 in 1991, fell to 4, even as the tech bubble was pushing other stocks
into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Amelio was not a fan of Jobs. Their first meeting had been in 1994,
just after Amelio was elected to the Apple board. Jobs had called him
and announced, “I want to come over and see you.” Amelio invited him
over to his office at National Semiconductor, and he later recalled
watching through the glass wall of his office as Jobs arrived. He looked
“rather like a boxer, aggressive and elusively graceful, or like an
elegant jungle cat ready to spring at its prey.” After a few minutes of
pleasantries—far more than Jobs usually engaged in—he abruptly announced
the reason for his visit. He wanted Amelio to help him return to Apple
as the CEO. “There’s only one person who can rally the Apple troops,”
Jobs said, “only one person who can straighten out the company.” The
Macintosh era had passed, Jobs argued, and it was now time for Apple to
create something new that was just as innovative.</p>
<p>“If the Mac is dead, what’s going to replace it?” Amelio asked.
Jobs’s reply didn’t impress him. “Steve didn’t seem to have a clear
answer,” Amelio later said. “He seemed to have a set of one-liners.”
Amelio felt he was witnessing Jobs’s reality distortion field and was
proud to be immune to it. He shooed Jobs unceremoniously out of his
office.</p>
<p>By the summer of 1996 Amelio realized that he had a serious problem.
Apple was pinning its hopes on creating a new operating system, called
Copland, but Amelio had discovered soon after becoming CEO that it was a
bloated piece of vaporware that would not solve Apple’s needs for better
networking and memory protection, nor would it be ready to ship as
scheduled in 1997. He publicly promised that he would quickly find an
alternative. His problem was that he didn’t have one.</p>
<p>So Apple needed a partner, one that could make a stable operating
system, preferably one that was UNIX-like and had an object-oriented
application layer. There was one company that could obviously supply
such software—NeXT—but it would take a while for Apple to focus on
it.</p>
<p>Apple first homed in on a company that had been started by Jean-Louis
Gassée, called Be. Gassée began negotiating the sale of Be to Apple, but
in August 1996 he overplayed his hand at a meeting with Amelio in
Hawaii. He said he wanted to bring his fifty-person team to Apple, and
he asked for 15% of the company, worth about 00 million. Amelio was
stunned. Apple calculated that Be was worth about 0 million. After a few
offers and counteroffers, Gassée refused to budge from demanding at
least 75 million. He thought that Apple had no alternatives. It got back
to Amelio that Gassée said, “I’ve got them by the balls, and I’m going
to squeeze until it hurts.” This did not please Amelio.</p>
<p>Apple’s chief technology officer, Ellen Hancock, argued for going
with Sun’s UNIX-based Solaris operating system, even though it did not
yet have a friendly user interface. Amelio began to favor using, of all
things, Microsoft’s Windows NT, which he felt could be rejiggered on the
surface to look and feel just like a Mac while being compatible with the
wide range of software available to Windows users. Bill Gates, eager to
make a deal, began personally calling Amelio.</p>
<p>There was, of course, one other option. Two years earlier Macworld
magazine columnist (and former Apple software evangelist) Guy Kawasaki
had published a parody press release joking that Apple was buying NeXT
and making Jobs its CEO. In the spoof Mike Markkula asked Jobs, “Do you
want to spend the rest of your life selling UNIX with a sugarcoating, or
change the world?” Jobs responded, “Because I’m now a father, I needed a
steadier source of income.” The release noted that “because of his
experience at Next, he is expected to bring a newfound sense of humility
back to Apple.” It also quoted Bill Gates as saying there would now be
more innovations from Jobs that Microsoft could copy. Everything in the
press release was meant as a joke, of course. But reality has an odd
habit of catching up with satire.</p>
<p>Slouching toward Cupertino</p>
<p>“Does anyone know Steve well enough to call him on this?” Amelio
asked his staff. Because his encounter with Jobs two years earlier had
ended badly, Amelio didn’t want to make the call himself. But as it
turned out, he didn’t need to. Apple was already getting incoming pings
from NeXT. A midlevel product marketer at NeXT, Garrett Rice, had simply
picked up the phone and, without consulting Jobs, called Ellen Hancock
to see if she might be interested in taking a look at its software. She
sent someone to meet with him.</p>
<p>By Thanksgiving of 1996 the two companies had begun midlevel talks,
and Jobs picked up the phone to call Amelio directly. “I’m on my way to
Japan, but I’ll be back in a week and I’d like to see you as soon as I
return,” he said. “Don’t make any decision until we can get together.”
Amelio, despite his earlier experience with Jobs, was thrilled to hear
from him and entranced by the possibility of working with him. “For me,
the phone call with Steve was like inhaling the flavors of a great
bottle of vintage wine,” he recalled. He gave his assurance he would
make no deal with Be or anyone else before they got together.</p>
<p>For Jobs, the contest against Be was both professional and personal.
NeXT was failing, and the prospect of being bought by Apple was a
tantalizing lifeline. In addition, Jobs held grudges, sometimes
passionately, and Gassée was near the top of his list, despite the fact
that they had seemed to reconcile when Jobs was at NeXT. “Gassée is one
of the few people in my life I would say is truly horrible,” Jobs later
insisted, unfairly. “He knifed me in the back in 1985.” Sculley, to his
credit, had at least been gentlemanly enough to knife Jobs in the
front.</p>
<p>On December 2, 1996, Steve Jobs set foot on Apple’s Cupertino campus
for the first time since his ouster eleven years earlier. In the
executive conference room, he met Amelio and Hancock to make the pitch
for NeXT. Once again he was scribbling on the whiteboard there, this
time giving his lecture about the four waves of computer systems that
had culminated, at least in his telling, with the launch of NeXT. He was
at his most seductive, despite the fact that he was speaking to two
people he didn’t respect. He was particularly adroit at feigning
modesty. “It’s probably a totally crazy idea,” he said, but if they
found it appealing, “I’ll structure any kind of deal you want—license
the software, sell you the company, whatever.” He was, in fact, eager to
sell everything, and he pushed that approach. “When you take a close
look, you’ll decide you want more than my software,” he told them.
“You’ll want to buy the whole company and take all the people.”</p>
<p>A few weeks later Jobs and his family went to Hawaii for Christmas
vacation. Larry Ellison was also there, as he had been the year before.
“You know, Larry, I think I’ve found a way for me to get back into Apple
and get control of it without you having to buy it,” Jobs said as they
walked along the shore. Ellison recalled, “He explained his strategy,
which was getting Apple to buy NeXT, then he would go on the board and
be one step away from being CEO.” Ellison thought that Jobs was missing
a key point. “But Steve, there’s one thing I don’t understand,” he said.
“If we don’t buy the company, how can we make any money?” It was a
reminder of how different their desires were. Jobs put his hand on
Ellison’s left shoulder, pulled him so close that their noses almost
touched, and said, “Larry, this is why it’s really important that I’m
your friend. You don’t need any more money.”</p>
<p>Ellison recalled that his own answer was almost a whine: “Well, I may
not need the money, but why should some fund manager at Fidelity get the
money? Why should someone else get it? Why shouldn’t it be us?”</p>
<p>“I think if I went back to Apple, and I didn’t own any of Apple, and
you didn’t own any of Apple, I’d have the moral high ground,” Jobs
replied.</p>
<p>“Steve, that’s really expensive real estate, this moral high ground,”
said Ellison. “Look, Steve, you’re my best friend, and Apple is your
company. I’ll do whatever you want.” Although Jobs later said that he
was not plotting to take over Apple at the time, Ellison thought it was
inevitable. “Anyone who spent more than a half hour with Amelio would
realize that he couldn’t do anything but self-destruct,” he later
said.</p>
<p>The big bakeoff between NeXT and Be was held at the Garden Court
Hotel in Palo Alto on December 10, in front of Amelio, Hancock, and six
other Apple executives. NeXT went first, with Avie Tevanian
demonstrating the software while Jobs displayed his hypnotizing
salesmanship. They showed how the software could play four video clips
on the screen at once, create multimedia, and link to the Internet.
“Steve’s sales pitch on the NeXT operating system was dazzling,”
according to Amelio. “He praised the virtues and strengths as though he
were describing a performance of Olivier as Macbeth.”</p>
<p>Gassée came in afterward, but he acted as if he had the deal in his
hand. He provided no new presentation. He simply said that the Apple
team knew the capabilities of the Be OS and asked if they had any
further questions. It was a short session. While Gassée was presenting,
Jobs and Tevanian walked the streets of Palo Alto. After a while they
bumped into one of the Apple executives who had been at the meetings.
“You’re going to win this,” he told them.</p>
<p>Tevanian later said that this was no surprise: “We had better
technology, we had a solution that was complete, and we had Steve.”
Amelio knew that bringing Jobs back into the fold would be a
double-edged sword, but the same was true of bringing Gassée back. Larry
Tesler, one of the Macintosh veterans from the old days, recommended to
Amelio that he choose NeXT, but added, “Whatever company you choose,
you’ll get someone who will take your job away, Steve or
Jean-Louis.”</p>
<p>Amelio opted for Jobs. He called Jobs to say that he planned to
propose to the Apple board that he be authorized to negotiate a purchase
of NeXT. Would he like to be at the meeting? Jobs said he would. When he
walked in, there was an emotional moment when he saw Mike Markkula. They
had not spoken since Markkula, once his mentor and father figure, had
sided with Sculley there back in 1985. Jobs walked over and shook his
hand.</p>
<p>Jobs invited Amelio to come to his house in Palo Alto so they could
negotiate in a friendly setting. When Amelio arrived in his classic 1973
Mercedes, Jobs was impressed; he liked the car. In the kitchen, which
had finally been renovated, Jobs put a kettle on for tea, and then they
sat at the wooden table in front of the open-hearth pizza oven. The
financial part of the negotiations went smoothly; Jobs was eager not to
make Gassée’s mistake of overreaching. He suggested that Apple pay 2 a
share for NeXT. That would amount to about 00 million. Amelio said that
was too high. He countered with 0 a share, or just over 00 million.
Unlike Be, NeXT had an actual product, real revenues, and a great team,
but Jobs was nevertheless pleasantly surprised at that counteroffer. He
accepted immediately.</p>
<p>One sticking point was that Jobs wanted his payout to be in cash.
Amelio insisted that he needed to “have skin in the game” and take the
payout in stock that he would agree to hold for at least a year. Jobs
resisted. Finally, they compromised: Jobs would take 20 million in cash
and 7 million in stock, and he pledged to hold the stock for at least
six months.</p>
<p>As usual Jobs wanted to have some of their conversation while taking
a walk. While they ambled around Palo Alto, he made a pitch to be put on
Apple’s board. Amelio tried to deflect it, saying there was too much
history to do something like that too quickly. “Gil, that really hurts,”
Jobs said. “This was my company. I’ve been left out since that horrible
day with Sculley.” Amelio said he understood, but he was not sure what
the board would want. When he was about to begin his negotiations with
Jobs, he had made a mental note to “move ahead with logic as my drill
sergeant” and “sidestep the charisma.” But during the walk he, like so
many others, was caught in Jobs’s force field. “I was hooked in by
Steve’s energy and enthusiasm,” he recalled.</p>
<p>After circling the long blocks a couple of times, they returned to
the house just as Laurene and the kids were arriving home. They all
celebrated the easy negotiations, then Amelio rode off in his Mercedes.
“He made me feel like a lifelong friend,” Amelio recalled. Jobs indeed
had a way of doing that. Later, after Jobs had engineered his ouster,
Amelio would look back on Jobs’s friendliness that day and note
wistfully, “As I would painfully discover, it was merely one facet of an
extremely complex personality.”</p>
<p>After informing Gassée that Apple was buying NeXT, Amelio had what
turned out to be an even more uncomfortable task: telling Bill Gates.
“He went into orbit,” Amelio recalled. Gates found it ridiculous, but
perhaps not surprising, that Jobs had pulled off this coup. “Do you
really think Steve Jobs has anything there?” Gates asked Amelio. “I know
his technology, it’s nothing but a warmed-over UNIX, and you’ll never be
able to make it work on your machines.” Gates, like Jobs, had a way of
working himself up, and he did so now: “Don’t you understand that Steve
doesn’t know anything about technology? He’s just a super salesman. I
can’t believe you’re making such a stupid decision. . . . He doesn’t
know anything about engineering, and 99% of what he says and thinks is
wrong. What the hell are you buying that garbage for?”</p>
<p>Years later, when I raised it with him, Gates did not recall being
that upset. The purchase of NeXT, he argued, did not really give Apple a
new operating system. “Amelio paid a lot for NeXT, and let’s be frank,
the NeXT OS was never really used.” Instead the purchase ended up
bringing in Avie Tevanian, who could help the existing Apple operating
system evolve so that it eventually incorporated the kernel of the NeXT
technology. Gates knew that the deal was destined to bring Jobs back to
power. “But that was a twist of fate,” he said. “What they ended up
buying was a guy who most people would not have predicted would be a
great CEO, because he didn’t have much experience at it, but he was a
brilliant guy with great design taste and great engineering taste. He
suppressed his craziness enough to get himself appointed interim
CEO.”</p>
<p>Despite what both Ellison and Gates believed, Jobs had deeply
conflicted feelings about whether he wanted to return to an active role
at Apple, at least while Amelio was there. A few days before the NeXT
purchase was due to be announced, Amelio asked Jobs to rejoin Apple
full-time and take charge of operating system development. Jobs,
however, kept deflecting Amelio’s request.</p>
<p>Finally, on the day that he was scheduled to make the big
announcement, Amelio called Jobs in. He needed an answer. “Steve, do you
just want to take your money and leave?” Amelio asked. “It’s okay if
that’s what you want.” Jobs did not answer; he just stared. “Do you want
to be on the payroll? An advisor?” Again Jobs stayed silent. Amelio went
out and grabbed Jobs’s lawyer, Larry Sonsini, and asked what he thought
Jobs wanted. “Beats me,” Sonsini said. So Amelio went back behind closed
doors with Jobs and gave it one more try. “Steve, what’s on your mind?
What are you feeling? Please, I need a decision now.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t get any sleep last night,” Jobs replied.</p>
<p>“Why? What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking about all the things that need to be done and about
the deal we’re making, and it’s all running together for me. I’m really
tired now and not thinking clearly. I just don’t want to be asked any
more questions.”</p>
<p>Amelio said that wasn’t possible. He needed to say something.</p>
<p>Finally Jobs answered, “Look, if you have to tell them something,
just say advisor to the chairman.” And that is what Amelio did.</p>
<p>The announcement was made that evening—December 20, 1996—in front of
250 cheering employees at Apple headquarters. Amelio did as Jobs had
requested and described his new role as merely that of a part-time
advisor. Instead of appearing from the wings of the stage, Jobs walked
in from the rear of the auditorium and ambled down the aisle. Amelio had
told the gathering that Jobs would be too tired to say anything, but by
then he had been energized by the applause. “I’m very excited,” Jobs
said. “I’m looking forward to get to reknow some old colleagues.” Louise
Kehoe of the Financial Times came up to the stage afterward and asked
Jobs, sounding almost accusatory, whether he was going to end up taking
over Apple. “Oh no, Louise,” he said. “There are a lot of other things
going on in my life now. I have a family. I am involved at Pixar. My
time is limited, but I hope I can share some ideas.”</p>
<p>The next day Jobs drove to Pixar. He had fallen increasingly in love
with the place, and he wanted to let the crew there know he was still
going to be president and deeply involved. But the Pixar people were
happy to see him go back to Apple part-time; a little less of Jobs’s
focus would be a good thing. He was useful when there were big
negotiations, but he could be dangerous when he had too much time on his
hands. When he arrived at Pixar that day, he went to Lasseter’s office
and explained that even just being an advisor at Apple would take up a
lot of his time. He said he wanted Lasseter’s blessing. “I keep thinking
about all the time away from my family this will cause, and the time
away from the other family at Pixar,” Jobs said. “But the only reason I
want to do it is that the world will be a better place with Apple in
it.”</p>
<p>Lasseter smiled gently. “You have my blessing,” he said.</p>
