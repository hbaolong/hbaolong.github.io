JOBS</h4>
<p>When Orbits Intersect</p>
<p>Jobs and Gates, 1991</p>
<p>The Macintosh Partnership</p>
<p>In astronomy, a binary system occurs when the orbits of two stars are
linked because of their gravitational interaction. There have been
analogous situations in history, when an era is shaped by the
relationship and rivalry of two orbiting superstars: Albert Einstein and
Niels Bohr in twentieth-century physics, for example, or Thomas
Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton in early American governance. For the
first thirty years of the personal computer age, beginning in the late
1970s, the defining binary star system was composed of two high-energy
college dropouts both born in 1955.</p>
<p>Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, despite their similar ambitions at the
confluence of technology and business, had very different personalities
and backgrounds. Gates’s father was a prominent Seattle lawyer, his
mother a civic leader on a variety of prestigious boards. He became a
tech geek at the area’s finest private school, Lakeside High, but he was
never a rebel, hippie, spiritual seeker, or member of the
counterculture. Instead of a Blue Box to rip off the phone company,
Gates created for his school a program for scheduling classes, which
helped him get into ones with the right girls, and a car-counting
program for local traffic engineers. He went to Harvard, and when he
decided to drop out it was not to find enlightenment with an Indian guru
but to start a computer software company.</p>
<p>Gates was good at computer coding, unlike Jobs, and his mind was more
practical, disciplined, and abundant in analytic processing power. Jobs
was more intuitive and romantic and had a greater instinct for making
technology usable, design delightful, and interfaces friendly. He had a
passion for perfection, which made him fiercely demanding, and he
managed by charisma and scattershot intensity. Gates was more
methodical; he held tightly scheduled product review meetings where he
would cut to the heart of issues with lapidary skill. Both could be
rude, but with Gates—who early in his career seemed to have a typical
geek’s flirtation with the fringes of the Asperger’s scale—the cutting
behavior tended to be less personal, based more on intellectual
incisiveness than emotional callousness. Jobs would stare at people with
a burning, wounding intensity; Gates sometimes had trouble making eye
contact, but he was fundamentally humane.</p>
<p>“Each one thought he was smarter than the other one, but Steve
generally treated Bill as someone who was slightly inferior, especially
in matters of taste and style,” said Andy Hertzfeld. “Bill looked down
on Steve because he couldn’t actually program.” From the beginning of
their relationship, Gates was fascinated by Jobs and slightly envious of
his mesmerizing effect on people. But he also found him “fundamentally
odd” and “weirdly flawed as a human being,” and he was put off by Jobs’s
rudeness and his tendency to be “either in the mode of saying you were
shit or trying to seduce you.” For his part, Jobs found Gates
unnervingly narrow. “He’d be a broader guy if he had dropped acid once
or gone off to an ashram when he was younger,” Jobs once declared.</p>
<p>Their differences in personality and character would lead them to
opposite sides of what would become the fundamental divide in the
digital age. Jobs was a perfectionist who craved control and indulged in
the uncompromising temperament of an artist; he and Apple became the
exemplars of a digital strategy that tightly integrated hardware,
software, and content into a seamless package. Gates was a smart,
calculating, and pragmatic analyst of business and technology; he was
open to licensing Microsoft’s operating system and software to a variety
of manufacturers.</p>
<p>After thirty years Gates would develop a grudging respect for Jobs.
“He really never knew much about technology, but he had an amazing
instinct for what works,” he said. But Jobs never reciprocated by fully
appreciating Gates’s real strengths. “Bill is basically unimaginative
and has never invented anything, which is why I think he’s more
comfortable now in philanthropy than technology,” Jobs said, unfairly.
“He just shamelessly ripped off other people’s ideas.”</p>
<p>When the Macintosh was first being developed, Jobs went up to visit
Gates at his office near Seattle. Microsoft had written some
applications for the Apple II, including a spreadsheet program called
Multiplan, and Jobs wanted to excite Gates and Co. about doing even more
for the forthcoming Macintosh. Sitting in Gates’s conference room, Jobs
spun an enticing vision of a computer for the masses, with a friendly
interface, which would be churned out by the millions in an automated
California factory. His description of the dream factory sucking in the
California silicon components and turning out finished Macintoshes
caused the Microsoft team to code-name the project “Sand.” They even
reverse-engineered it into an acronym, for “Steve’s amazing new
device.”</p>
<p>Gates had launched Microsoft by writing a version of BASIC, a
programming language, for the Altair. Jobs wanted Microsoft to write a
version of BASIC for the Macintosh, because Wozniak—despite much
prodding by Jobs—had never enhanced his version of the Apple II’s BASIC
to handle floating-point numbers. In addition, Jobs wanted Microsoft to
write application software—such as word processing and spreadsheet
programs—for the Macintosh. At the time, Jobs was a king and Gates still
a courtier: In 1982 Apple’s annual sales were billion, while Microsoft’s
were a mere 2 million. Gates signed on to do graphical versions of a new
spreadsheet called Excel, a word-processing program called Word, and
BASIC.</p>
<p>Gates frequently went to Cupertino for demonstrations of the
Macintosh operating system, and he was not very impressed. “I remember
the first time we went down, Steve had this app where it was just things
bouncing around on the screen,” he said. “That was the only app that
ran.” Gates was also put off by Jobs’s attitude. “It was kind of a weird
seduction visit, where Steve was saying, ‘We don’t really need you and
we’re doing this great thing, and it’s under the cover.’ He’s in his
Steve Jobs sales mode, but kind of the sales mode that also says, ‘I
don’t need you, but I might let you be involved.’”</p>
<p>The Macintosh pirates found Gates hard to take. “You could tell that
Bill Gates was not a very good listener. He couldn’t bear to have anyone
explain how something worked to him—he had to leap ahead instead and
guess about how he thought it would work,” Hertzfeld recalled. They
showed him how the Macintosh’s cursor moved smoothly across the screen
without flickering. “What kind of hardware do you use to draw the
cursor?” Gates asked. Hertzfeld, who took great pride that they could
achieve their functionality solely using software, replied, “We don’t
have any special hardware for it!” Gates insisted that it was necessary
to have special hardware to move the cursor that way. “So what do you
say to somebody like that?” Bruce Horn, one of the Macintosh engineers,
later said. “It made it clear to me that Gates was not the kind of
person that would understand or appreciate the elegance of a
Macintosh.”</p>
<p>Despite their mutual wariness, both teams were excited by the
prospect that Microsoft would create graphical software for the
Macintosh that would take personal computing into a new realm, and they
went to dinner at a fancy restaurant to celebrate. Microsoft soon
dedicated a large team to the task. “We had more people working on the
Mac than he did,” Gates said. “He had about fourteen or fifteen people.
We had like twenty people. We really bet our life on it.” And even
though Jobs thought that they didn’t exhibit much taste, the Microsoft
programmers were persistent. “They came out with applications that were
terrible,” Jobs recalled, “but they kept at it and they made them
better.” Eventually Jobs became so enamored of Excel that he made a
secret bargain with Gates: If Microsoft would make Excel exclusively for
the Macintosh for two years, and not make a version for IBM PCs, then
Jobs would shut down his team working on a version of BASIC for the
Macintosh and instead indefinitely license Microsoft’s BASIC. Gates
smartly took the deal, which infuriated the Apple team whose project got
canceled and gave Microsoft a lever in future negotiations.</p>
<p>For the time being, Gates and Jobs forged a bond. That summer they
went to a conference hosted by the industry analyst Ben Rosen at a
Playboy Club retreat in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, where nobody knew about
the graphical interfaces that Apple was developing. “Everybody was
acting like the IBM PC was everything, which was nice, but Steve and I
were kind of smiling that, hey, we’ve got something,” Gates recalled.
“And he’s kind of leaking, but nobody actually caught on.” Gates became
a regular at Apple retreats. “I went to every luau,” said Gates. “I was
part of the crew.”</p>
<p>Gates enjoyed his frequent visits to Cupertino, where he got to watch
Jobs interact erratically with his employees and display his obsessions.
“Steve was in his ultimate pied piper mode, proclaiming how the Mac will
change the world and overworking people like mad, with incredible
tensions and complex personal relationships.” Sometimes Jobs would begin
on a high, then lapse into sharing his fears with Gates. “We’d go down
Friday night, have dinner, and Steve would just be promoting that
everything is great. Then the second day, without fail, he’d be kind of,
‘Oh shit, is this thing going to sell, oh God, I have to raise the
price, I’m sorry I did that to you, and my team is a bunch of
idiots.’”</p>
<p>Gates saw Jobs’s reality distortion field at play when the Xerox Star
was launched. At a joint team dinner one Friday night, Jobs asked Gates
how many Stars had been sold thus far. Gates said six hundred. The next
day, in front of Gates and the whole team, Jobs said that three hundred
Stars had been sold, forgetting that Gates had just told everyone it was
actually six hundred. “So his whole team starts looking at me like, ‘Are
you going to tell him that he’s full of shit?’” Gates recalled. “And in
that case I didn’t take the bait.” On another occasion Jobs and his team
were visiting Microsoft and having dinner at the Seattle Tennis Club.
Jobs launched into a sermon about how the Macintosh and its software
would be so easy to use that there would be no manuals. “It was like
anybody who ever thought that there would be a manual for any Mac
application was the greatest idiot,” said Gates. “And we were like,
‘Does he really mean it? Should we not tell him that we have people who
are actually working on manuals?’”</p>
<p>After a while the relationship became bumpier. The original plan was
to have some of the Microsoft applications—such as Excel, Chart, and
File—carry the Apple logo and come bundled with the purchase of a
Macintosh. “We were going to get 0 per app, per machine,” said Gates.
But this arrangement upset competing software makers. In addition, it
seemed that some of Microsoft’s programs might be late. So Jobs invoked
a provision in his deal with Microsoft and decided not to bundle its
software; Microsoft would have to scramble to distribute its software as
products sold directly to consumers.</p>
<p>Gates went along without much complaint. He was already getting used
to the fact that, as he put it, Jobs could “play fast and loose,” and he
suspected that the unbundling would actually help Microsoft. “We could
make more money selling our software separately,” Gates said. “It works
better that way if you’re willing to think you’re going to have
reasonable market share.” Microsoft ended up making its software for
various other platforms, and it began to give priority to the IBM PC
version of Microsoft Word rather than the Macintosh version. In the end,
Jobs’s decision to back out of the bundling deal hurt Apple more than it
did Microsoft.</p>
<p>When Excel for the Macintosh was released, Jobs and Gates unveiled it
together at a press dinner at New York’s Tavern on the Green. Asked if
Microsoft would make a version of it for IBM PCs, Gates did not reveal
the bargain he had made with Jobs but merely answered that “in time”
that might happen. Jobs took the microphone. “I’m sure ‘in time’ we’ll
all be dead,” he joked.</p>
<p>The Battle of the GUI</p>
<p>At that time, Microsoft was producing an operating system, known as
DOS, which it licensed to IBM and compatible computers. It was based on
an old-fashioned command line interface that confronted users with surly
little prompts such as C:&gt;. As Jobs and his team began to work
closely with Microsoft, they grew worried that it would copy Macintosh’s
graphical user interface. Andy Hertzfeld noticed that his contact at
Microsoft was asking detailed questions about how the Macintosh
operating system worked. “I told Steve that I suspected that Microsoft
was going to clone the Mac,” he recalled.</p>
<p>They were right to worry. Gates believed that graphical interfaces
were the future, and that Microsoft had just as much right as Apple did
to copy what had been developed at Xerox PARC. As he freely admitted
later, “We sort of say, ‘Hey, we believe in graphics interfaces, we saw
the Xerox Alto too.’”</p>
<p>In their original deal, Jobs had convinced Gates to agree that
Microsoft would not create graphical software for anyone other than
Apple until a year after the Macintosh shipped in January 1983.
Unfortunately for Apple, it did not provide for the possibility that the
Macintosh launch would be delayed for a year. So Gates was within his
rights when, in November 1983, he revealed that Microsoft planned to
develop a new operating system for IBM PCs featuring a graphical
interface with windows, icons, and a mouse for point-and-click
navigation. It would be called Windows. Gates hosted a Jobs-like product
announcement, the most lavish thus far in Microsoft’s history, at the
Helmsley Palace Hotel in New York.</p>
<p>Jobs was furious. He knew there was little he could do about
it—Microsoft’s deal with Apple not to do competing graphical software
was running out—but he lashed out nonetheless. “Get Gates down here
immediately,” he ordered Mike Boich, who was Apple’s evangelist to other
software companies. Gates arrived, alone and willing to discuss things
with Jobs. “He called me down to get pissed off at me,” Gates recalled.
“I went down to Cupertino, like a command performance. I told him,
‘We’re doing Windows.’ I said to him, ‘We’re betting our company on
graphical interfaces.’”</p>
<p>They met in Jobs’s conference room, where Gates found himself
surrounded by ten Apple employees who were eager to watch their boss
assail him. Jobs didn’t disappoint his troops. “You’re ripping us off!”
he shouted. “I trusted you, and now you’re stealing from us!” Hertzfeld
recalled that Gates just sat there coolly, looking Steve in the eye,
before hurling back, in his squeaky voice, what became a classic zinger.
“Well, Steve, I think there’s more than one way of looking at it. I
think it’s more like we both had this rich neighbor named Xerox and I
broke into his house to steal the TV set and found out that you had
already stolen it.”</p>
<p>Gates’s two-day visit provoked the full range of Jobs’s emotional
responses and manipulation techniques. It also made clear that the
Apple-Microsoft symbiosis had become a scorpion dance, with both sides
circling warily, knowing that a sting by either could cause problems for
both. After the confrontation in the conference room, Gates quietly gave
Jobs a private demo of what was being planned for Windows. “Steve didn’t
know what to say,” Gates recalled. “He could either say, ‘Oh, this is a
violation of something,’ but he didn’t. He chose to say, ‘Oh, it’s
actually really a piece of shit.’” Gates was thrilled, because it gave
him a chance to calm Jobs down for a moment. “I said, ‘Yes, it’s a nice
little piece of shit.’” So Jobs went through a gamut of other emotions.
“During the course of this meeting, he’s just ruder than shit,” Gates
said. “And then there’s a part where he’s almost crying, like, ‘Oh, just
give me a chance to get this thing off.’” Gates responded by becoming
very calm. “I’m good at when people are emotional, I’m kind of less
emotional.”</p>
<p>As he often did when he wanted to have a serious conversation, Jobs
suggested they go on a long walk. They trekked the streets of Cupertino,
back and forth to De Anza college, stopping at a diner and then walking
some more. “We had to take a walk, which is not one of my management
techniques,” Gates said. “That was when he began saying things like,
‘Okay, okay, but don’t make it too much like what we’re doing.’”</p>
<p>As it turned out, Microsoft wasn’t able to get Windows 1.0 ready for
shipping until the fall of 1985. Even then, it was a shoddy product. It
lacked the elegance of the Macintosh interface, and it had tiled windows
rather than the magical clipping of overlapping windows that Bill
Atkinson had devised. Reviewers ridiculed it and consumers spurned it.
Nevertheless, as is often the case with Microsoft products, persistence
eventually made Windows better and then dominant.</p>
<p>Jobs never got over his anger. “They just ripped us off completely,
because Gates has no shame,” Jobs told me almost thirty years later.
Upon hearing this, Gates responded, “If he believes that, he really has
entered into one of his own reality distortion fields.” In a legal
sense, Gates was right, as courts over the years have subsequently
ruled. And on a practical level, he had a strong case as well. Even
though Apple made a deal for the right to use what it saw at Xerox PARC,
it was inevitable that other companies would develop similar graphical
interfaces. As Apple found out, the “look and feel” of a computer
interface design is a hard thing to protect.</p>
<p>And yet Jobs’s dismay was understandable. Apple had been more
innovative, imaginative, elegant in execution, and brilliant in design.
But even though Microsoft created a crudely copied series of products,
it would end up winning the war of operating systems. This exposed an
aesthetic flaw in how the universe worked: The best and most innovative
products don’t always win. A decade later, this truism caused Jobs to
let loose a rant that was somewhat arrogant and over-the-top, but also
had a whiff of truth to it. “The only problem with Microsoft is they
just have no taste, they have absolutely no taste,” he said. “I don’t
mean that in a small way. I mean that in a big way, in the sense that
they don’t think of original ideas and they don’t bring much culture
into their product.”</p>
