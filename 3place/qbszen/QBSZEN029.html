PRINCIPLES</h4>
<p>The Studio of Jobs and Ive</p>
<p>With Jony Ive and the sunflower iMac, 2002</p>
<p>Jony Ive</p>
<p>When Jobs gathered his top management for a pep talk just after he
became iCEO in September 1997, sitting in the audience was a sensitive
and passionate thirty-year-old Brit who was head of the company’s design
team. Jonathan Ive, known to all as Jony, was planning to quit. He was
sick of the company’s focus on profit maximization rather than product
design. Jobs’s talk led him to reconsider. “I remember very clearly
Steve announcing that our goal is not just to make money but to make
great products,” Ive recalled. “The decisions you make based on that
philosophy are fundamentally different from the ones we had been making
at Apple.” Ive and Jobs would soon forge a bond that would lead to the
greatest industrial design collaboration of their era.</p>
<p>Ive grew up in Chingford, a town on the northeast edge of London. His
father was a silversmith who taught at the local college. “He’s a
fantastic craftsman,” Ive recalled. “His Christmas gift to me would be
one day of his time in his college workshop, during the Christmas break
when no one else was there, helping me make whatever I dreamed up.” The
only condition was that Jony had to draw by hand what they planned to
make. “I always understood the beauty of things made by hand. I came to
realize that what was really important was the care that was put into
it. What I really despise is when I sense some carelessness in a
product.”</p>
<p>Ive enrolled in Newcastle Polytechnic and spent his spare time and
summers working at a design consultancy. One of his creations was a pen
with a little ball on top that was fun to fiddle with. It helped give
the owner a playful emotional connection to the pen. For his thesis he
designed a microphone and earpiece—in purest white plastic—to
communicate with hearing-impaired kids. His flat was filled with foam
models he had made to help him perfect the design. He also designed an
ATM machine and a curved phone, both of which won awards from the Royal
Society of Arts. Unlike some designers, he didn’t just make beautiful
sketches; he also focused on how the engineering and inner components
would work. He had an epiphany in college when he was able to design on
a Macintosh. “I discovered the Mac and felt I had a connection with the
people who were making this product,” he recalled. “I suddenly
understood what a company was, or was supposed to be.”</p>
<p>After graduation Ive helped to build a design firm in London,
Tangerine, which got a consulting contract with Apple. In 1992 he moved
to Cupertino to take a job in the Apple design department. He became the
head of the department in 1996, the year before Jobs returned, but
wasn’t happy. Amelio had little appreciation for design. “There wasn’t
that feeling of putting care into a product, because we were trying to
maximize the money we made,” Ive said. “All they wanted from us
designers was a model of what something was supposed to look like on the
outside, and then engineers would make it as cheap as possible. I was
about to quit.”</p>
<p>When Jobs took over and gave his pep talk, Ive decided to stick
around. But Jobs at first looked around for a world-class designer from
the outside. He talked to Richard Sapper, who designed the IBM ThinkPad,
and Giorgetto Giugiaro, who designed the Ferrari 250 and the Maserati
Ghibli. But then he took a tour of Apple’s design studio and bonded with
the affable, eager, and very earnest Ive. “We discussed approaches to
forms and materials,” Ive recalled. “We were on the same wavelength. I
suddenly understood why I loved the company.”</p>
<p>Ive reported, at least initially, to Jon Rubinstein, whom Jobs had
brought in to head the hardware division, but he developed a direct and
unusually strong relationship with Jobs. They began to have lunch
together regularly, and Jobs would end his day by dropping by Ive’s
design studio for a chat. “Jony had a special status,” said Laurene
Powell. “He would come by our house, and our families became close.
Steve is never intentionally wounding to him. Most people in Steve’s
life are replaceable. But not Jony.”</p>
<p>Jobs described to me his respect for Ive:</p>
<p>The difference that Jony has made, not only at Apple but in the
world, is huge. He is a wickedly intelligent person in all ways. He
understands business concepts, marketing concepts. He picks stuff up
just like that, click. He understands what we do at our core better than
anyone. If I had a spiritual partner at Apple, it’s Jony. Jony and I
think up most of the products together and then pull others in and say,
“Hey, what do you think about this?” He gets the big picture as well as
the most infinitesimal details about each product. And he understands
that Apple is a product company. He’s not just a designer. That’s why he
works directly for me. He has more operational power than anyone else at
Apple except me. There’s no one who can tell him what to do, or to butt
out. That’s the way I set it up.</p>
<p>Like most designers, Ive enjoyed analyzing the philosophy and the
step-by-step thinking that went into a particular design. For Jobs, the
process was more intuitive. He would point to models and sketches he
liked and dump on the ones he didn’t. Ive would then take the cues and
develop the concepts Jobs blessed.</p>
<p>Ive was a fan of the German industrial designer Dieter Rams, who
worked for the electronics firm Braun. Rams preached the gospel of “Less
but better,” Weniger aber besser, and likewise Jobs and Ive wrestled
with each new design to see how much they could simplify it. Ever since
Apple’s first brochure proclaimed “Simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication,” Jobs had aimed for the simplicity that comes from
conquering complexities, not ignoring them. “It takes a lot of hard
work,” he said, “to make something simple, to truly understand the
underlying challenges and come up with elegant solutions.”</p>
<p>In Ive, Jobs met his soul mate in the quest for true rather than
surface simplicity. Sitting in his design studio, Ive described his
philosophy:</p>
<p>Why do we assume that simple is good? Because with physical products,
we have to feel we can dominate them. As you bring order to complexity,
you find a way to make the product defer to you. Simplicity isn’t just a
visual style. It’s not just minimalism or the absence of clutter. It
involves digging through the depth of the complexity. To be truly
simple, you have to go really deep. For example, to have no screws on
something, you can end up having a product that is so convoluted and so
complex. The better way is to go deeper with the simplicity, to
understand everything about it and how it’s manufactured. You have to
deeply understand the essence of a product in order to be able to get
rid of the parts that are not essential.</p>
<p>That was the fundamental principle Jobs and Ive shared. Design was
not just about what a product looked like on the surface. It had to
reflect the product’s essence. “In most people’s vocabularies, design
means veneer,” Jobs told Fortune shortly after retaking the reins at
Apple. “But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.
Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up
expressing itself in successive outer layers.”</p>
<p>As a result, the process of designing a product at Apple was
integrally related to how it would be engineered and manufactured. Ive
described one of Apple’s Power Macs. “We wanted to get rid of anything
other than what was absolutely essential,” he said. “To do so required
total collaboration between the designers, the product developers, the
engineers, and the manufacturing team. We kept going back to the
beginning, again and again. Do we need that part? Can we get it to
perform the function of the other four parts?”</p>
<p>The connection between the design of a product, its essence, and its
manufacturing was illustrated for Jobs and Ive when they were traveling
in France and went into a kitchen supply store. Ive picked up a knife he
admired, but then put it down in disappointment. Jobs did the same. “We
both noticed a tiny bit of glue between the handle and the blade,” Ive
recalled. They talked about how the knife’s good design had been ruined
by the way it was manufactured. “We don’t like to think of our knives as
being glued together,” Ive said. “Steve and I care about things like
that, which ruin the purity and detract from the essence of something
like a utensil, and we think alike about how products should be made to
look pure and seamless.”</p>
<p>At most other companies, engineering tends to drive design. The
engineers set forth their specifications and requirements, and the
designers then come up with cases and shells that will accommodate them.
For Jobs, the process tended to work the other way. In the early days of
Apple, Jobs had approved the design of the case of the original
Macintosh, and the engineers had to make their boards and components
fit.</p>
<p>After he was forced out, the process at Apple reverted to being
engineer-driven. “Before Steve came back, engineers would say ‘Here are
the guts’—processor, hard drive—and then it would go to the designers to
put it in a box,” said Apple’s marketing chief Phil Schiller. “When you
do it that way, you come up with awful products.” But when Jobs returned
and forged his bond with Ive, the balance was again tilted toward the
designers. “Steve kept impressing on us that the design was integral to
what would make us great,” said Schiller. “Design once again dictated
the engineering, not just vice versa.”</p>
<p>On occasion this could backfire, such as when Jobs and Ive insisted
on using a solid piece of brushed aluminum for the edge of the iPhone 4
even when the engineers worried that it would compromise the antenna.
But usually the distinctiveness of its designs—for the iMac, the iPod,
the iPhone, and the iPad—would set Apple apart and lead to its triumphs
in the years after Jobs returned.</p>
<p>Inside the Studio</p>
<p>The design studio where Jony Ive reigns, on the ground floor of Two
Infinite Loop on the Apple campus, is shielded by tinted windows and a
heavy clad, locked door. Just inside is a glass-booth reception desk
where two assistants guard access. Even high-level Apple employees are
not allowed in without special permission. Most of my interviews with
Jony Ive for this book were held elsewhere, but one day in 2010 he
arranged for me to spend an afternoon touring the studio and talking
about how he and Jobs collaborate there.</p>
<p>To the left of the entrance is a bullpen of desks with young
designers; to the right is the cavernous main room with six long steel
tables for displaying and playing with works in progress. Beyond the
main room is a computer-aided design studio, filled with workstations,
that leads to a room with molding machines to turn what’s on the screens
into foam models. Beyond that is a robot-controlled spray-painting
chamber to make the models look real. The look is sparse and industrial,
with metallic gray décor. Leaves from the trees outside cast moving
patterns of light and shadows on the tinted windows. Techno and jazz
play in the background.</p>
<p>Almost every day when Jobs was healthy and in the office, he would
have lunch with Ive and then wander by the studio in the afternoon. As
he entered, he could survey the tables and see the products in the
pipeline, sense how they fit into Apple’s strategy, and inspect with his
fingertips the evolving design of each. Usually it was just the two of
them alone, while the other designers glanced up from their work but
kept a respectful distance. If Jobs had a specific issue, he might call
over the head of mechanical design or another of Ive’s deputies. If
something excited him or sparked some thoughts about corporate strategy,
he might ask the chief operating officer Tim Cook or the marketing head
Phil Schiller to come over and join them. Ive described the usual
process:</p>
<p>This great room is the one place in the company where you can look
around and see everything we have in the works. When Steve comes in, he
will sit at one of these tables. If we’re working on a new iPhone, for
example, he might grab a stool and start playing with different models
and feeling them in his hands, remarking on which ones he likes best.
Then he will graze by the other tables, just him and me, to see where
all the other products are heading. He can get a sense of the sweep of
the whole company, the iPhone and iPad, the iMac and laptop and
everything we’re considering. That helps him see where the company is
spending its energy and how things connect. And he can ask, “Does doing
this make sense, because over here is where we are growing a lot?” or
questions like that. He gets to see things in relationship to each
other, which is pretty hard to do in a big company. Looking at the
models on these tables, he can see the future for the next three
years.</p>
<p>Much of the design process is a conversation, a back-and-forth as we
walk around the tables and play with the models. He doesn’t like to read
complex drawings. He wants to see and feel a model. He’s right. I get
surprised when we make a model and then realize it’s rubbish, even
though based on the CAD [computer-aided design] renderings it looked
great.</p>
<p>He loves coming in here because it’s calm and gentle. It’s a paradise
if you’re a visual person. There are no formal design reviews, so there
are no huge decision points. Instead, we can make the decisions fluid.
Since we iterate every day and never have dumb-ass presentations, we
don’t run into major disagreements.</p>
<p>On this day Ive was overseeing the creation of a new European power
plug and connector for the Macintosh. Dozens of foam models, each with
the tiniest variation, have been cast and painted for inspection. Some
would find it odd that the head of design would fret over something like
this, but Jobs got involved as well. Ever since he had a special power
supply made for the Apple II, Jobs has cared about not only the
engineering but also the design of such parts. His name is listed on the
patent for the white power brick used by the MacBook as well as its
magnetic connector with its satisfying click. In fact he is listed as
one of the inventors for 212 different Apple patents in the United
States as of the beginning of 2011.</p>
<p>Ive and Jobs have even obsessed over, and patented, the packaging for
various Apple products. U.S. patent D558572, for example, granted on
January 1, 2008, is for the iPod Nano box, with four drawings showing
how the device is nestled in a cradle when the box is opened. Patent
D596485, issued on July 21, 2009, is for the iPhone packaging, with its
sturdy lid and little glossy plastic tray inside.</p>
<p>Early on, Mike Markkula had taught Jobs to “impute”—to understand
that people do judge a book by its cover—and therefore to make sure all
the trappings and packaging of Apple signaled that there was a beautiful
gem inside. Whether it’s an iPod Mini or a MacBook Pro, Apple customers
know the feeling of opening up the well-crafted box and finding the
product nestled in an inviting fashion. “Steve and I spend a lot of time
on the packaging,” said Ive. “I love the process of unpacking something.
You design a ritual of unpacking to make the product feel special.
Packaging can be theater, it can create a story.”</p>
<p>Ive, who has the sensitive temperament of an artist, at times got
upset with Jobs for taking too much credit, a habit that has bothered
other colleagues over the years. His personal feelings for Jobs were so
intense that at times he got easily bruised. “He will go through a
process of looking at my ideas and say, ‘That’s no good. That’s not very
good. I like that one,’” Ive said. “And later I will be sitting in the
audience and he will be talking about it as if it was his idea. I pay
maniacal attention to where an idea comes from, and I even keep
notebooks filled with my ideas. So it hurts when he takes credit for one
of my designs.” Ive also has bristled when outsiders portrayed Jobs as
the only ideas guy at Apple. “That makes us vulnerable as a company,”
Ive said earnestly, his voice soft. But then he paused to recognize the
role Jobs in fact played. “In so many other companies, ideas and great
design get lost in the process,” he said. “The ideas that come from me
and my team would have been completely irrelevant, nowhere, if Steve
hadn’t been here to push us, work with us, and drive through all the
resistance to turn our ideas into products.”</p>
