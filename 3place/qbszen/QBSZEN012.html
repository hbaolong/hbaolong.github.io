<h4 id="chapter-nine-going-public">CHAPTER NINE GOING PUBLIC</h4>
<p>A Man of Wealth and Fame</p>
<p>With Wozniak, 1981</p>
<p>Options</p>
<p>When Mike Markkula joined Jobs and Wozniak to turn their fledgling
partnership into the Apple Computer Co. in January 1977, they valued it
at ,309. Less than four years later they decided it was time to take it
public. It would become the most oversubscribed initial public offering
since that of Ford Motors in 1956. By the end of December 1980, Apple
would be valued at .79 billion. Yes, billion. In the process it would
make three hundred people millionaires.</p>
<p>Daniel Kottke was not one of them. He had been Jobs’s soul mate in
college, in India, at the All One Farm, and in the rental house they
shared during the Chrisann Brennan crisis. He joined Apple when it was
headquartered in Jobs’s garage, and he still worked there as an hourly
employee. But he was not at a high enough level to be cut in on the
stock options that were awarded before the IPO. “I totally trusted
Steve, and I assumed he would take care of me like I’d taken care of
him, so I didn’t push,” said Kottke. The official reason he wasn’t given
stock options was that he was an hourly technician, not a salaried
engineer, which was the cutoff level for options. Even so, he could have
justifiably been given “founder’s stock,” but Jobs decided not to.
“Steve is the opposite of loyal,” according to Andy Hertzfeld, an early
Apple engineer who has nevertheless remained friends with him. “He’s
anti-loyal. He has to abandon the people he is close to.”</p>
<p>Kottke decided to press his case with Jobs by hovering outside his
office and catching him to make a plea. But at each encounter, Jobs
brushed him off. “What was really so difficult for me is that Steve
never told me I wasn’t eligible,” recalled Kottke. “He owed me that as a
friend. When I would ask him about stock, he would tell me I had to talk
to my manager.” Finally, almost six months after the IPO, Kottke worked
up the courage to march into Jobs’s office and try to hash out the
issue. But when he got in to see him, Jobs was so cold that Kottke
froze. “I just got choked up and began to cry and just couldn’t talk to
him,” Kottke recalled. “Our friendship was all gone. It was so sad.”</p>
<p>Rod Holt, the engineer who had built the power supply, was getting a
lot of options, and he tried to turn Jobs around. “We have to do
something for your buddy Daniel,” he said, and he suggested they each
give him some of their own options. “Whatever you give him, I will match
it,” said Holt. Replied Jobs, “Okay. I will give him zero.”</p>
<p>Wozniak, not surprisingly, had the opposite attitude. Before the
shares went public, he decided to sell, at a very low price, two
thousand of his options to forty different midlevel employees. Most of
his beneficiaries made enough to buy a home. Wozniak bought a dream home
for himself and his new wife, but she soon divorced him and kept the
house. He also later gave shares outright to employees he felt had been
shortchanged, including Kottke, Fernandez, Wigginton, and Espinosa.
Everyone loved Wozniak, all the more so after his generosity, but many
also agreed with Jobs that he was “awfully naïve and childlike.” A few
months later a United Way poster showing a destitute man went up on a
company bulletin board. Someone scrawled on it “Woz in 1990.”</p>
<p>Jobs was not naïve. He had made sure his deal with Chrisann Brennan
was signed before the IPO occurred.</p>
<p>Jobs was the public face of the IPO, and he helped choose the two
investment banks handling it: the traditional Wall Street firm Morgan
Stanley and the untraditional boutique firm Hambrecht andandandand Quist
in San Francisco. “Steve was very irreverent toward the guys from Morgan
Stanley, which was a pretty uptight firm in those days,” recalled Bill
Hambrecht. Morgan Stanley planned to price the offering at 8, even
though it was obvious the shares would quickly shoot up. “Tell me what
happens to this stock that we priced at eighteen?” Jobs asked the
bankers. “Don’t you sell it to your good customers? If so, how can you
charge me a 7% commission?” Hambrecht recognized that there was a basic
unfairness in the system, and he later went on to formulate the idea of
a reverse auction to price shares before an IPO.</p>
<p>Apple went public the morning of December 12, 1980. By then the
bankers had priced the stock at 2 a share. It went to 9 the first day.
Jobs had come into the Hambrecht andandandand Quist office just in time
to watch the opening trades. At age twenty-five, he was now worth 56
million.</p>
<p>Baby You’re a Rich Man</p>
<p>Before and after he was rich, and indeed throughout a life that
included being both broke and a billionaire, Steve Jobs’s attitude
toward wealth was complex. He was an antimaterialistic hippie who
capitalized on the inventions of a friend who wanted to give them away
for free, and he was a Zen devotee who made a pilgrimage to India and
then decided that his calling was to create a business. And yet somehow
these attitudes seemed to weave together rather than conflict.</p>
<p>He had a great love for some material objects, especially those that
were finely designed and crafted, such as Porsche and Mercedes cars,
Henckels knives and Braun appliances, BMW motorcycles and Ansel Adams
prints, Bösendorfer pianos and Bang andandandand Olufsen audio
equipment. Yet the houses he lived in, no matter how rich he became,
tended not to be ostentatious and were furnished so simply they would
have put a Shaker to shame. Neither then nor later would he travel with
an entourage, keep a personal staff, or even have security protection.
He bought a nice car, but always drove himself. When Markkula asked Jobs
to join him in buying a Lear jet, he declined (though he eventually
would demand of Apple a Gulfstream to use). Like his father, he could be
flinty when bargaining with suppliers, but he didn’t allow a craving for
profits to take precedence over his passion for building great
products.</p>
<p>Thirty years after Apple went public, he reflected on what it was
like to come into money suddenly:</p>
<p>I never worried about money. I grew up in a middle-class family, so I
never thought I would starve. And I learned at Atari that I could be an
okay engineer, so I always knew I could get by. I was voluntarily poor
when I was in college and India, and I lived a pretty simple life even
when I was working. So I went from fairly poor, which was wonderful,
because I didn’t have to worry about money, to being incredibly rich,
when I also didn’t have to worry about money.</p>
<p>I watched people at Apple who made a lot of money and felt they had
to live differently. Some of them bought a Rolls-Royce and various
houses, each with a house manager and then someone to manage the house
managers. Their wives got plastic surgery and turned into these bizarre
people. This was not how I wanted to live. It’s crazy. I made a promise
to myself that I’m not going to let this money ruin my life.</p>
<p>He was not particularly philanthropic. He briefly set up a
foundation, but he discovered that it was annoying to have to deal with
the person he had hired to run it, who kept talking about “venture”
philanthropy and how to “leverage” giving. Jobs became contemptuous of
people who made a display of philanthropy or thinking they could
reinvent it. Earlier he had quietly sent in a ,000 check to help launch
Larry Brilliant’s Seva Foundation to fight diseases of poverty, and he
even agreed to join the board. But when Brilliant brought some board
members, including Wavy Gravy and Jerry Garcia, to Apple right after its
IPO to solicit a donation, Jobs was not forthcoming. He instead worked
on finding ways that a donated Apple II and a VisiCalc program could
make it easier for the foundation to do a survey it was planning on
blindness in Nepal.</p>
<p>His biggest personal gift was to his parents, Paul and Clara Jobs, to
whom he gave about 50,000 worth of stock. They sold some to pay off the
mortgage on their Los Altos home, and their son came over for the little
celebration. “It was the first time in their lives they didn’t have a
mortgage,” Jobs recalled. “They had a handful of their friends over for
the party, and it was really nice.” Still, they didn’t consider buying a
nicer house. “They weren’t interested in that,” Jobs said. “They had a
life they were happy with.” Their only splurge was to take a Princess
cruise each year. The one through the Panama Canal “was the big one for
my dad,” according to Jobs, because it reminded him of when his Coast
Guard ship went through on its way to San Francisco to be
decommissioned.</p>
<p>With Apple’s success came fame for its poster boy. Inc. became the
first magazine to put him on its cover, in October 1981. “This man has
changed business forever,” it proclaimed. It showed Jobs with a neatly
trimmed beard and well-styled long hair, wearing blue jeans and a dress
shirt with a blazer that was a little too satiny. He was leaning on an
Apple II and looking directly into the camera with the mesmerizing stare
he had picked up from Robert Friedland. “When Steve Jobs speaks, it is
with the gee-whiz enthusiasm of someone who sees the future and is
making sure it works,” the magazine reported.</p>
<p>Time followed in February 1982 with a package on young entrepreneurs.
The cover was a painting of Jobs, again with his hypnotic stare. Jobs,
said the main story, “practically singlehanded created the personal
computer industry.” The accompanying profile, written by Michael Moritz,
noted, “At 26, Jobs heads a company that six years ago was located in a
bedroom and garage of his parents’ house, but this year it is expected
to have sales of 00 million. . . . As an executive, Jobs has sometimes
been petulant and harsh on subordinates. Admits he: ‘I’ve got to learn
to keep my feelings private.’”</p>
<p>Despite his new fame and fortune, he still fancied himself a child of
the counterculture. On a visit to a Stanford class, he took off his
Wilkes Bashford blazer and his shoes, perched on top of a table, and
crossed his legs into a lotus position. The students asked questions,
such as when Apple’s stock price would rise, which Jobs brushed off.
Instead he spoke of his passion for future products, such as someday
making a computer as small as a book. When the business questions
tapered off, Jobs turned the tables on the well-groomed students. “How
many of you are virgins?” he asked. There were nervous giggles. “How
many of you have taken LSD?” More nervous laughter, and only one or two
hands went up. Later Jobs would complain about the new generation of
kids, who seemed to him more materialistic and careerist than his own.
“When I went to school, it was right after the sixties and before this
general wave of practical purposefulness had set in,” he said. “Now
students aren’t even thinking in idealistic terms, or at least nowhere
near as much.” His generation, he said, was different. “The idealistic
wind of the sixties is still at our backs, though, and most of the
people I know who are my age have that ingrained in them forever.”</p>
