<p>You Say You Want a Revolution</p>
<p>Jobs in 1982</p>
<p>Jef Raskin’s Baby</p>
<p>Jef Raskin was the type of character who could enthrall Steve Jobs—or
annoy him. As it turned out, he did both. A philosophical guy who could
be both playful and ponderous, Raskin had studied computer science,
taught music and visual arts, conducted a chamber opera company, and
organized guerrilla theater. His 1967 doctoral thesis at U.C. San Diego
argued that computers should have graphical rather than text-based
interfaces. When he got fed up with teaching, he rented a hot air
balloon, flew over the chancellor’s house, and shouted down his decision
to quit.</p>
<p>When Jobs was looking for someone to write a manual for the Apple II
in 1976, he called Raskin, who had his own little consulting firm.
Raskin went to the garage, saw Wozniak beavering away at a workbench,
and was convinced by Jobs to write the manual for 0. Eventually he
became the manager of Apple’s publications department. One of Raskin’s
dreams was to build an inexpensive computer for the masses, and in 1979
he convinced Mike Markkula to put him in charge of a small development
project code-named “Annie” to do just that. Since Raskin thought it was
sexist to name computers after women, he redubbed the project in honor
of his favorite type of apple, the McIntosh. But he changed the spelling
in order not to conflict with the name of the audio equipment maker
McIntosh Laboratory. The proposed computer became known as the
Macintosh.</p>
<p>Raskin envisioned a machine that would sell for ,000 and be a simple
appliance, with screen and keyboard and computer all in one unit. To
keep the cost down, he proposed a tiny five-inch screen and a very cheap
(and underpowered) microprocessor, the Motorola 6809. Raskin fancied
himself a philosopher, and he wrote his thoughts in an ever-expanding
notebook that he called “The Book of Macintosh.” He also issued
occasional manifestos. One of these was called “Computers by the
Millions,” and it began with an aspiration: “If personal computers are
to be truly personal, it will have to be as likely as not that a family,
picked at random, will own one.”</p>
<p>Throughout 1979 and early 1980 the Macintosh project led a tenuous
existence. Every few months it would almost get killed off, but each
time Raskin managed to cajole Markkula into granting clemency. It had a
research team of only four engineers located in the original Apple
office space next to the Good Earth restaurant, a few blocks from the
company’s new main building. The work space was filled with enough toys
and radio-controlled model airplanes (Raskin’s passion) to make it look
like a day care center for geeks. Every now and then work would cease
for a loosely organized game of Nerf ball tag. Andy Hertzfeld recalled,
“This inspired everyone to surround their work area with barricades made
out of cardboard, to provide cover during the game, making part of the
office look like a cardboard maze.”</p>
<p>The star of the team was a blond, cherubic, and psychologically
intense self-taught young engineer named Burrell Smith, who worshipped
the code work of Wozniak and tried to pull off similar dazzling feats.
Atkinson discovered Smith working in Apple’s service department and,
amazed at his ability to improvise fixes, recommended him to Raskin.
Smith would later succumb to schizophrenia, but in the early 1980s he
was able to channel his manic intensity into weeklong binges of
engineering brilliance.</p>
<p>Jobs was enthralled by Raskin’s vision, but not by his willingness to
make compromises to keep down the cost. At one point in the fall of 1979
Jobs told him instead to focus on building what he repeatedly called an
“insanely great” product. “Don’t worry about price, just specify the
computer’s abilities,” Jobs told him. Raskin responded with a sarcastic
memo. It spelled out everything you would want in the proposed computer:
a high-resolution color display, a printer that worked without a ribbon
and could produce graphics in color at a page per second, unlimited
access to the ARPA net, and the capability to recognize speech and
synthesize music, “even simulate Caruso singing with the Mormon
tabernacle choir, with variable reverberation.” The memo concluded,
“Starting with the abilities desired is nonsense. We must start both
with a price goal, and a set of abilities, and keep an eye on today’s
and the immediate future’s technology.” In other words, Raskin had
little patience for Jobs’s belief that you could distort reality if you
had enough passion for your product.</p>
<p>Thus they were destined to clash, especially after Jobs was ejected
from the Lisa project in September 1980 and began casting around for
someplace else to make his mark. It was inevitable that his gaze would
fall on the Macintosh project. Raskin’s manifestos about an inexpensive
machine for the masses, with a simple graphic interface and clean
design, stirred his soul. And it was also inevitable that once Jobs set
his sights on the Macintosh project, Raskin’s days were numbered. “Steve
started acting on what he thought we should do, Jef started brooding,
and it instantly was clear what the outcome would be,” recalled Joanna
Hoffman, a member of the Mac team.</p>
<p>The first conflict was over Raskin’s devotion to the underpowered
Motorola 6809 microprocessor. Once again it was a clash between Raskin’s
desire to keep the Mac’s price under ,000 and Jobs’s determination to
build an insanely great machine. So Jobs began pushing for the Mac to
switch to the more powerful Motorola 68000, which is what the Lisa was
using. Just before Christmas 1980, he challenged Burrell Smith, without
telling Raskin, to make a redesigned prototype that used the more
powerful chip. As his hero Wozniak would have done, Smith threw himself
into the task around the clock, working nonstop for three weeks and
employing all sorts of breathtaking programming leaps. When he
succeeded, Jobs was able to force the switch to the Motorola 68000, and
Raskin had to brood and recalculate the cost of the Mac.</p>
<p>There was something larger at stake. The cheaper microprocessor that
Raskin wanted would not have been able to accommodate all of the
gee-whiz graphics—windows, menus, mouse, and so on—that the team had
seen on the Xerox PARC visits. Raskin had convinced everyone to go to
Xerox PARC, and he liked the idea of a bitmapped display and windows,
but he was not as charmed by all the cute graphics and icons, and he
absolutely detested the idea of using a point-and-click mouse rather
than the keyboard. “Some of the people on the project became enamored of
the quest to do everything with the mouse,” he later groused. “Another
example is the absurd application of icons. An icon is a symbol equally
incomprehensible in all human languages. There’s a reason why humans
invented phonetic languages.”</p>
<p>Raskin’s former student Bill Atkinson sided with Jobs. They both
wanted a powerful processor that could support whizzier graphics and the
use of a mouse. “Steve had to take the project away from Jef,” Atkinson
said. “Jef was pretty firm and stubborn, and Steve was right to take it
over. The world got a better result.”</p>
<p>The disagreements were more than just philosophical; they became
clashes of personality. “I think that he likes people to jump when he
says jump,” Raskin once said. “I felt that he was untrustworthy, and
that he does not take kindly to being found wanting. He doesn’t seem to
like people who see him without a halo.” Jobs was equally dismissive of
Raskin. “Jef was really pompous,” he said. “He didn’t know much about
interfaces. So I decided to nab some of his people who were really good,
like Atkinson, bring in some of my own, take the thing over and build a
less expensive Lisa, not some piece of junk.”</p>
<p>Some on the team found Jobs impossible to work with. “Jobs seems to
introduce tension, politics, and hassles rather than enjoying a buffer
from those distractions,” one engineer wrote in a memo to Raskin in
December 1980. “I thoroughly enjoy talking with him, and I admire his
ideas, practical perspective, and energy. But I just don’t feel that he
provides the trusting, supportive, relaxed environment that I need.”</p>
<p>But many others realized that despite his temperamental failings,
Jobs had the charisma and corporate clout that would lead them to “make
a dent in the universe.” Jobs told the staff that Raskin was just a
dreamer, whereas he was a doer and would get the Mac done in a year. It
was clear he wanted vindication for having been ousted from the Lisa
group, and he was energized by competition. He publicly bet John Couch
,000 that the Mac would ship before the Lisa. “We can make a computer
that’s cheaper and better than the Lisa, and get it out first,” he told
the team.</p>
<p>Jobs asserted his control of the group by canceling a brown-bag lunch
seminar that Raskin was scheduled to give to the whole company in
February 1981. Raskin happened to go by the room anyway and discovered
that there were a hundred people there waiting to hear him; Jobs had not
bothered to notify anyone else about his cancellation order. So Raskin
went ahead and gave a talk.</p>
<p>That incident led Raskin to write a blistering memo to Mike Scott,
who once again found himself in the difficult position of being a
president trying to manage a company’s temperamental cofounder and major
stockholder. It was titled “Working for/with Steve Jobs,” and in it
Raskin asserted:</p>
<p>He is a dreadful manager. . . . I have always liked Steve, but I have
found it impossible to work for him. . . . Jobs regularly misses
appointments. This is so well-known as to be almost a running joke. . .
. He acts without thinking and with bad judgment. . . . He does not give
credit where due. . . . Very often, when told of a new idea, he will
immediately attack it and say that it is worthless or even stupid, and
tell you that it was a waste of time to work on it. This alone is bad
management, but if the idea is a good one he will soon be telling people
about it as though it was his own.</p>
<p>That afternoon Scott called in Jobs and Raskin for a showdown in
front of Markkula. Jobs started crying. He and Raskin agreed on only one
thing: Neither could work for the other one. On the Lisa project, Scott
had sided with Couch. This time he decided it was best to let Jobs win.
After all, the Mac was a minor development project housed in a distant
building that could keep Jobs occupied away from the main campus. Raskin
was told to take a leave of absence. “They wanted to humor me and give
me something to do, which was fine,” Jobs recalled. “It was like going
back to the garage for me. I had my own ragtag team and I was in
control.”</p>
<p>Raskin’s ouster may not have seemed fair, but it ended up being good
for the Macintosh. Raskin wanted an appliance with little memory, an
anemic processor, a cassette tape, no mouse, and minimal graphics.
Unlike Jobs, he might have been able to keep the price down to close to
,000, and that may have helped Apple win market share. But he could not
have pulled off what Jobs did, which was to create and market a machine
that would transform personal computing. In fact we can see where the
road not taken led. Raskin was hired by Canon to build the machine he
wanted. “It was the Canon Cat, and it was a total flop,” Atkinson said.
“Nobody wanted it. When Steve turned the Mac into a compact version of
the Lisa, it made it into a computing platform instead of a consumer
electronic device.”1</p>
<p>Texaco Towers</p>
<p>A few days after Raskin left, Jobs appeared at the cubicle of Andy
Hertzfeld, a young engineer on the Apple II team, who had a cherubic
face and impish demeanor similar to his pal Burrell Smith’s. Hertzfeld
recalled that most of his colleagues were afraid of Jobs “because of his
spontaneous temper tantrums and his proclivity to tell everyone exactly
what he thought, which often wasn’t very favorable.” But Hertzfeld was
excited by him. “Are you any good?” Jobs asked the moment he walked in.
“We only want really good people working on the Mac, and I’m not sure
you’re good enough.” Hertzfeld knew how to answer. “I told him that yes,
I thought that I was pretty good.”</p>
<p>Jobs left, and Hertzfeld went back to his work. Later that afternoon
he looked up to see Jobs peering over the wall of his cubicle. “I’ve got
good news for you,” he said. “You’re working on the Mac team now. Come
with me.”</p>
<p>Hertzfeld replied that he needed a couple more days to finish the
Apple II product he was in the middle of. “What’s more important than
working on the Macintosh?” Jobs demanded. Hertzfeld explained that he
needed to get his Apple II DOS program in good enough shape to hand it
over to someone. “You’re just wasting your time with that!” Jobs
replied. “Who cares about the Apple II? The Apple II will be dead in a
few years. The Macintosh is the future of Apple, and you’re going to
start on it now!” With that, Jobs yanked out the power cord to
Hertzfeld’s Apple II, causing the code he was working on to vanish.
“Come with me,” Jobs said. “I’m going to take you to your new desk.”
Jobs drove Hertzfeld, computer and all, in his silver Mercedes to the
Macintosh offices. “Here’s your new desk,” he said, plopping him in a
space next to Burrell Smith. “Welcome to the Mac team!” The desk had
been Raskin’s. In fact Raskin had left so hastily that some of the
drawers were still filled with his flotsam and jetsam, including model
airplanes.</p>
<p>Jobs’s primary test for recruiting people in the spring of 1981 to be
part of his merry band of pirates was making sure they had a passion for
the product. He would sometimes bring candidates into a room where a
prototype of the Mac was covered by a cloth, dramatically unveil it, and
watch. “If their eyes lit up, if they went right for the mouse and
started pointing and clicking, Steve would smile and hire them,”
recalled Andrea Cunningham. “He wanted them to say ‘Wow!’”</p>
<p>Bruce Horn was one of the programmers at Xerox PARC. When some of his
friends, such as Larry Tesler, decided to join the Macintosh group, Horn
considered going there as well. But he got a good offer, and a 5,000
signing bonus, to join another company. Jobs called him on a Friday
night. “You have to come into Apple tomorrow morning,” he said. “I have
a lot of stuff to show you.” Horn did, and Jobs hooked him. “Steve was
so passionate about building this amazing device that would change the
world,” Horn recalled. “By sheer force of his personality, he changed my
mind.” Jobs showed Horn exactly how the plastic would be molded and
would fit together at perfect angles, and how good the board was going
to look inside. “He wanted me to see that this whole thing was going to
happen and it was thought out from end to end. Wow, I said, I don’t see
that kind of passion every day. So I signed up.”</p>
<p>Jobs even tried to reengage Wozniak. “I resented the fact that he had
not been doing much, but then I thought, hell, I wouldn’t be here
without his brilliance,” Jobs later told me. But as soon as Jobs was
starting to get him interested in the Mac, Wozniak crashed his new
single-engine Beechcraft while attempting a takeoff near Santa Cruz. He
barely survived and ended up with partial amnesia. Jobs spent time at
the hospital, but when Wozniak recovered he decided it was time to take
a break from Apple. Ten years after dropping out of Berkeley, he decided
to return there to finally get his degree, enrolling under the name of
Rocky Raccoon Clark.</p>
<p>In order to make the project his own, Jobs decided it should no
longer be code-named after Raskin’s favorite apple. In various
interviews, Jobs had been referring to computers as a bicycle for the
mind; the ability of humans to create a bicycle allowed them to move
more efficiently than even a condor, and likewise the ability to create
computers would multiply the efficiency of their minds. So one day Jobs
decreed that henceforth the Macintosh should be known instead as the
Bicycle. This did not go over well. “Burrell and I thought this was the
silliest thing we ever heard, and we simply refused to use the new
name,” recalled Hertzfeld. Within a month the idea was dropped.</p>
<p>By early 1981 the Mac team had grown to about twenty, and Jobs
decided that they should have bigger quarters. So he moved everyone to
the second floor of a brown-shingled, two-story building about three
blocks from Apple’s main offices. It was next to a Texaco station and
thus became known as Texaco Towers. In order to make the office more
lively, he told the team to buy a stereo system. “Burrell and I ran out
and bought a silver, cassette-based boom box right away, before he could
change his mind,” recalled Hertzfeld.</p>
<p>Jobs’s triumph was soon complete. A few weeks after winning his power
struggle with Raskin to run the Mac division, he helped push out Mike
Scott as Apple’s president. Scotty had become more and more erratic,
alternately bullying and nurturing. He finally lost most of his support
among the employees when he surprised them by imposing a round of
layoffs that he handled with atypical ruthlessness. In addition, he had
begun to suffer a variety of afflictions, ranging from eye infections to
narcolepsy. When Scott was on vacation in Hawaii, Markkula called
together the top managers to ask if he should be replaced. Most of them,
including Jobs and John Couch, said yes. So Markkula took over as an
interim and rather passive president, and Jobs found that he now had
full rein to do what he wanted with the Mac division.</p>
