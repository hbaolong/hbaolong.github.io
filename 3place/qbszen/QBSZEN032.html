<h4 id="chapter-twenty-nine-apple-stores">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE APPLE
STORES</h4>
<p>Genius Bars and Siena Sandstone</p>
<p>New York’s Fifth Avenue store</p>
<p>The Customer Experience</p>
<p>Jobs hated to cede control of anything, especially when it might
affect the customer experience. But he faced a problem. There was one
part of the process he didn’t control: the experience of buying an Apple
product in a store.</p>
<p>The days of the Byte Shop were over. Industry sales were shifting
from local computer specialty shops to megachains and big box stores,
where most clerks had neither the knowledge nor the incentive to explain
the distinctive nature of Apple products. “All that the salesman cared
about was a 0 spiff,” Jobs said. Other computers were pretty generic,
but Apple’s had innovative features and a higher price tag. He didn’t
want an iMac to sit on a shelf between a Dell and a Compaq while an
uninformed clerk recited the specs of each. “Unless we could find ways
to get our message to customers at the store, we were screwed.”</p>
<p>In great secrecy, Jobs began in late 1999 to interview executives who
might be able to develop a string of Apple retail stores. One of the
candidates had a passion for design and the boyish enthusiasm of a
natural-born retailer: Ron Johnson, the vice president for merchandising
at Target, who was responsible for launching distinctive-looking
products, such as a teakettle designed by Michael Graves. “Steve is very
easy to talk to,” said Johnson in recalling their first meeting. “All of
a sudden there’s a torn pair of jeans and turtleneck, and he’s off and
running about why he needed great stores. If Apple is going to succeed,
he told me, we’re going to win on innovation. And you can’t win on
innovation unless you have a way to communicate to customers.”</p>
<p>When Johnson came back in January 2000 to be interviewed again, Jobs
suggested that they take a walk. They went to the sprawling 140-store
Stanford Shopping Mall at 8:30 a.m. The stores weren’t open yet, so they
walked up and down the entire mall repeatedly and discussed how it was
organized, what role the big department stores played relative to the
other stores, and why certain specialty shops were successful.</p>
<p>They were still walking and talking when the stores opened at 10, and
they went into Eddie Bauer. It had an entrance off the mall and another
off the parking lot. Jobs decided that Apple stores should have only one
entrance, which would make it easier to control the experience. And the
Eddie Bauer store, they agreed, was too long and narrow. It was
important that customers intuitively grasp the layout of a store as soon
as they entered.</p>
<p>There were no tech stores in the mall, and Johnson explained why: The
conventional wisdom was that a consumer, when making a major and
infrequent purchase such as a computer, would be willing to drive to a
less convenient location, where the rent would be cheaper. Jobs
disagreed. Apple stores should be in malls and on Main Streets—in areas
with a lot of foot traffic, no matter how expensive. “We may not be able
to get them to drive ten miles to check out our products, but we can get
them to walk ten feet,” he said. The Windows users, in particular, had
to be ambushed: “If they’re passing by, they will drop in out of
curiosity, if we make it inviting enough, and once we get a chance to
show them what we have, we will win.”</p>
<p>Johnson said that the size of a store signaled the importance of the
brand. “Is Apple as big of a brand as the Gap?” he asked. Jobs said it
was much bigger. Johnson replied that its stores should therefore be
bigger. “Otherwise you won’t be relevant.” Jobs described Mike
Markkula’s maxim that a good company must “impute”—it must convey its
values and importance in everything it does, from packaging to
marketing. Johnson loved it. It definitely applied to a company’s
stores. “The store will become the most powerful physical expression of
the brand,” he predicted. He said that when he was young he had gone to
the wood-paneled, art-filled mansion-like store that Ralph Lauren had
created at Seventy-second and Madison in Manhattan. “Whenever I buy a
polo shirt, I think of that mansion, which was a physical expression of
Ralph’s ideals,” Johnson said. “Mickey Drexler did that with the Gap.
You couldn’t think of a Gap product without thinking of the great Gap
store with the clean space and wood floors and white walls and folded
merchandise.”</p>
<p>When they finished, they drove to Apple and sat in a conference room
playing with the company’s products. There weren’t many, not enough to
fill the shelves of a conventional store, but that was an advantage. The
type of store they would build, they decided, would benefit from having
few products. It would be minimalist and airy and offer a lot of places
for people to try out things. “Most people don’t know Apple products,”
Johnson said. “They think of Apple as a cult. You want to move from a
cult to something cool, and having an awesome store where people can try
things will help that.” The stores would impute the ethos of Apple
products: playful, easy, creative, and on the bright side of the line
between hip and intimidating.</p>
<p>The Prototype</p>
<p>When Jobs finally presented the idea, the board was not thrilled.
Gateway Computers was going down in flames after opening suburban
stores, and Jobs’s argument that his would do better because they would
be in more expensive locations was not, on its face, reassuring. “Think
different” and “Here’s to the crazy ones” made for good advertising
slogans, but the board was hesitant to make them guidelines for
corporate strategy. “I’m scratching my head and thinking this is crazy,”
recalled Art Levinson, the CEO of Genentech who joined the Apple board
in 2000. “We are a small company, a marginal player. I said that I’m not
sure I can support something like this.” Ed Woolard was also dubious.
“Gateway has tried this and failed, while Dell is selling direct to
consumers without stores and succeeding,” he argued. Jobs was not
appreciative of too much pushback from the board. The last time that
happened, he had replaced most of the members. This time, for personal
reasons as well as being tired of playing tug-of-war with Jobs, Woolard
decided to step down. But before he did, the board approved a trial run
of four Apple stores.</p>
<p>Jobs did have one supporter on the board. In 1999 he had recruited
the Bronx-born retailing prince Millard “Mickey” Drexler, who as CEO of
Gap had transformed a sleepy chain into an icon of American casual
culture. He was one of the few people in the world who were as
successful and savvy as Jobs on matters of design, image, and consumer
yearnings. In addition, he had insisted on end-to-end control: Gap
stores sold only Gap products, and Gap products were sold almost
exclusively in Gap stores. “I left the department store business because
I couldn’t stand not controlling my own product, from how it’s
manufactured to how it’s sold,” Drexler said. “Steve is just that way,
which is why I think he recruited me.”</p>
<p>Drexler gave Jobs a piece of advice: Secretly build a prototype of
the store near the Apple campus, furnish it completely, and then hang
out there until you feel comfortable with it. So Johnson and Jobs rented
a vacant warehouse in Cupertino. Every Tuesday for six months, they
convened an all-morning brainstorming session there, refining their
retailing philosophy as they walked the space. It was the store
equivalent of Ive’s design studio, a haven where Jobs, with his visual
approach, could come up with innovations by touching and seeing the
options as they evolved. “I loved to wander over there on my own, just
checking it out,” Jobs recalled.</p>
<p>Sometimes he made Drexler, Larry Ellison, and other trusted friends
come look. “On too many weekends, when he wasn’t making me watch new
scenes from Toy Story, he made me go to the warehouse and look at the
mockups for the store,” Ellison said. “He was obsessed by every detail
of the aesthetic and the service experience. It got to the point where I
said, ‘Steve I’m not coming to see you if you’re going to make me go to
the store again.’”</p>
<p>Ellison’s company, Oracle, was developing software for the handheld
checkout system, which avoided having a cash register counter. On each
visit Jobs prodded Ellison to figure out ways to streamline the process
by eliminating some unnecessary step, such as handing over the credit
card or printing a receipt. “If you look at the stores and the products,
you will see Steve’s obsession with beauty as simplicity—this Bauhaus
aesthetic and wonderful minimalism, which goes all the way to the
checkout process in the stores,” said Ellison. “It means the absolute
minimum number of steps. Steve gave us the exact, explicit recipe for
how he wanted the checkout to work.”</p>
<p>When Drexler came to see the prototype, he had some criticisms: “I
thought the space was too chopped up and not clean enough. There were
too many distracting architectural features and colors.” He emphasized
that a customer should be able to walk into a retail space and, with one
sweep of the eye, understand the flow. Jobs agreed that simplicity and
lack of distractions were keys to a great store, as they were to a
product. “After that, he nailed it,” said Drexler. “The vision he had
was complete control of the entire experience of his product, from how
it was designed and made to how it was sold.”</p>
<p>In October 2000, near what he thought was the end of the process,
Johnson woke up in the middle of a night before one of the Tuesday
meetings with a painful thought: They had gotten something fundamentally
wrong. They were organizing the store around each of Apple’s main
product lines, with areas for the PowerMac, iMac, iBook, and PowerBook.
But Jobs had begun developing a new concept: the computer as a hub for
all your digital activity. In other words, your computer might handle
video and pictures from your cameras, and perhaps someday your music
player and songs, or your books and magazines. Johnson’s predawn
brainstorm was that the stores should organize displays not just around
the company’s four lines of computers, but also around things people
might want to do. “For example, I thought there should be a movie bay
where we’d have various Macs and PowerBooks running iMovie and showing
how you can import from your video camera and edit.”</p>
<p>Johnson arrived at Jobs’s office early that Tuesday and told him
about his sudden insight that they needed to reconfigure the stores. He
had heard tales of his boss’s intemperate tongue, but he had not yet
felt its lash—until now. Jobs erupted. “Do you know what a big change
this is?” he yelled. “I’ve worked my ass off on this store for six
months, and now you want to change everything!” Jobs suddenly got quiet.
“I’m tired. I don’t know if I can design another store from
scratch.”</p>
<p>Johnson was speechless, and Jobs made sure he remained so. On the
ride to the prototype store, where people had gathered for the Tuesday
meeting, he told Johnson not to say a word, either to him or to the
other members of the team. So the seven-minute drive proceeded in
silence. When they arrived, Jobs had finished processing the
information. “I knew Ron was right,” he recalled. So to Johnson’s
surprise, Jobs opened the meeting by saying, “Ron thinks we’ve got it
all wrong. He thinks it should be organized not around products but
instead around what people do.” There was a pause, then Jobs continued.
“And you know, he’s right.” He said they would redo the layout, even
though it would likely delay the planned January rollout by three or
four months. “We’ve only got one chance to get it right.”</p>
<p>Jobs liked to tell the story—and he did so to his team that day—about
how everything that he had done correctly had required a moment when he
hit the rewind button. In each case he had to rework something that he
discovered was not perfect. He talked about doing it on Toy Story, when
the character of Woody had evolved into being a jerk, and on a couple of
occasions with the original Macintosh. “If something isn’t right, you
can’t just ignore it and say you’ll fix it later,” he said. “That’s what
other companies do.”</p>
<p>When the revised prototype was finally completed in January 2001,
Jobs allowed the board to see it for the first time. He explained the
theories behind the design by sketching on a whiteboard; then he loaded
board members into a van for the two-mile trip. When they saw what Jobs
and Johnson had built, they unanimously approved going ahead. It would,
the board agreed, take the relationship between retailing and brand
image to a new level. It would also ensure that consumers did not see
Apple computers as merely a commodity product like Dell or Compaq.</p>
<p>Most outside experts disagreed. “Maybe it’s time Steve Jobs stopped
thinking quite so differently,” Business Week wrote in a story headlined
“Sorry Steve, Here’s Why Apple Stores Won’t Work.” Apple’s former chief
financial officer, Joseph Graziano, was quoted as saying, “Apple’s
problem is it still believes the way to grow is serving caviar in a
world that seems pretty content with cheese and crackers.” And the
retail consultant David Goldstein declared, “I give them two years
before they’re turning out the lights on a very painful and expensive
mistake.”</p>
<p>Wood, Stone, Steel, Glass</p>
<p>On May 19, 2001, the first Apple store opened in Tyson’s Corner,
Virginia, with gleaming white counters, bleached wood floors, and a huge
“Think Different” poster of John and Yoko in bed. The skeptics were
wrong. Gateway stores had been averaging 250 visitors a week. By 2004
Apple stores were averaging 5,400 per week. That year the stores had .2
billion in revenue, setting a record in the retail industry for reaching
the billion-dollar milestone. Sales in each store were tabulated every
four minutes by Ellison’s software, giving instant information on how to
integrate manufacturing, supply, and sales channels.</p>
<p>As the stores flourished, Jobs stayed involved in every aspect. Lee
Clow recalled, “In one of our marketing meetings just as the stores were
opening, Steve made us spend a half hour deciding what hue of gray the
restroom signs should be.” The architectural firm of Bohlin Cywinski
Jackson designed the signature stores, but Jobs made all of the major
decisions.</p>
<p>Jobs particularly focused on the staircases, which echoed the one he
had built at NeXT. When he visited a store as it was being constructed,
he invariably suggested changes to the staircase. His name is listed as
the lead inventor on two patent applications on the staircases, one for
the see-through look that features all-glass treads and glass supports
melded together with titanium, the other for the engineering system that
uses a monolithic unit of glass containing multiple glass sheets
laminated together for supporting loads.</p>
<p>In 1985, as he was being ousted from his first tour at Apple, he had
visited Italy and been impressed by the gray stone of Florence’s
sidewalks. In 2002, when he came to the conclusion that the light wood
floors in the stores were beginning to look somewhat pedestrian—a
concern that it’s hard to imagine bedeviling someone like Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer—Jobs wanted to use that stone instead. Some of his
colleagues pushed to replicate the color and texture using concrete,
which would have been ten times cheaper, but Jobs insisted that it had
to be authentic. The gray-blue Pietra Serena sandstone, which has a
fine-grained texture, comes from a family-owned quarry, Il Casone, in
Firenzuola outside of Florence. “We select only 3% of what comes out of
the mountain, because it has to have the right shading and veining and
purity,” said Johnson. “Steve felt very strongly that we had to get the
color right and it had to be a material with high integrity.” So
designers in Florence picked out just the right quarried stone, oversaw
cutting it into the proper tiles, and made sure each tile was marked
with a sticker to ensure that it was laid out next to its companion
tiles. “Knowing that it’s the same stone that Florence uses for its
sidewalks assures you that it can stand the test of time,” said
Johnson.</p>
<p>Another notable feature of the stores was the Genius Bar. Johnson
came up with the idea on a two-day retreat with his team. He had asked
them all to describe the best service they’d ever enjoyed. Almost
everyone mentioned some nice experience at a Four Seasons or
Ritz-Carlton hotel. So Johnson sent his first five store managers
through the Ritz-Carlton training program and came up with the idea of
replicating something between a concierge desk and a bar. “What if we
staffed the bar with the smartest Mac people,” he said to Jobs. “We
could call it the Genius Bar.”</p>
<p>Jobs called the idea crazy. He even objected to the name. “You can’t
call them geniuses,” he said. “They’re geeks. They don’t have the people
skills to deliver on something called the genius bar.” Johnson thought
he had lost, but the next day he ran into Apple’s general counsel, who
said, “By the way, Steve just told me to trademark the name ‘genius
bar.’”</p>
<p>Many of Jobs’s passions came together for Manhattan’s Fifth Avenue
store, which opened in 2006: a cube, a signature staircase, glass, and
making a maximum statement through minimalism. “It was really Steve’s
store,” said Johnson. Open 24/7, it vindicated the strategy of finding
signature high-traffic locations by attracting fifty thousand visitors a
week during its first year. (Remember Gateway’s draw: 250 visitors a
week.) “This store grosses more per square foot than any store in the
world,” Jobs proudly noted in 2010. “It also grosses more in
total—absolute dollars, not just per square foot—than any store in New
York. That includes Saks and Bloomingdale’s.”</p>
<p>Jobs was able to drum up excitement for store openings with the same
flair he used for product releases. People began to travel to store
openings and spend the night outside so they could be among the first
in. “My then 14-year-old son suggested my first overnighter at Palo
Alto, and the experience turned into an interesting social event,” wrote
Gary Allen, who started a website that caters to Apple store fans. “He
and I have done several overnighters, including five in other countries,
and have met so many great people.”</p>
<p>In July 2011, a decade after the first ones opened, there were 326
Apple stores. The biggest was in London’s Covent Garden, the tallest in
Tokyo’s Ginza. The average annual revenue per store was 4 million, and
the total net sales in fiscal 2010 were .8 billion. But the stores did
even more. They directly accounted for only 15% of Apple’s revenue, but
by creating buzz and brand awareness they indirectly helped boost
everything the company did.</p>
<p>Even as he was fighting the effects of cancer in 2011, Jobs spent
time envisioning future store projects, such as the one he wanted to
build in New York City’s Grand Central Terminal. One afternoon he showed
me a picture of the Fifth Avenue store and pointed to the eighteen
pieces of glass on each side. “This was state of the art in glass
technology at the time,” he said. “We had to build our own autoclaves to
make the glass.” Then he pulled out a drawing in which the eighteen
panes were replaced by four huge panes. That is what he wanted to do
next, he said. Once again, it was a challenge at the intersection of
aesthetics and technology. “If we wanted to do it with our current
technology, we would have to make the cube a foot shorter,” he said.
“And I didn’t want to do that. So we have to build some new autoclaves
in China.”</p>
<p>Ron Johnson was not thrilled by the idea. He thought the eighteen
panes actually looked better than four panes would. “The proportions we
have today work magically with the colonnade of the GM Building,” he
said. “It glitters like a jewel box. I think if we get the glass too
transparent, it will almost go away to a fault.” He debated the point
with Jobs, but to no avail. “When technology enables something new, he
wants to take advantage of that,” said Johnson. “Plus, for Steve, less
is always more, simpler is always better. Therefore, if you can build a
glass box with fewer elements, it’s better, it’s simpler, and it’s at
the forefront of technology. That’s where Steve likes to be, in both his
products and his stores.”</p>
