<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>A CENTURY and a half after its initial publication, Walden has become
such a totem of the back-to-nature, preservationist, anti-business,
civil-disobedience mind-set, and Thoreau so vivid a protester, so
perfect a crank and hermit saint, that the book itself risks being as
revered and unread as the Bible. Of the American classics densely arisen
in the middle of the nineteenth century—Hawthorne’s Scarlet Letter
(1850), Melville’s Moby-Dick (1851), Whitman’s Leaves of Grass (1855),
to which we might add Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1854)
as a nation-stirring best-seller and Emerson’s essays as an
indispensable preparation of the ground—Walden has contributed most to
America’s present sense of itself. In a time of informational overload,
of clamorously inane and ubiquitous electronic entertainment, and of a
fraught, globally challenged, ever more demanding workplace, the urge to
build a cabin in the woods and thus reform, simplify, and cleanse one’s
life—“to front,” in Thoreau’s ringing verb, “only the essential facts of
life”—remains strong. The vacation industry, so-called, thrives on it,
and camper sales, and the weekend recourse to second homes in the
northern forests or the western mountains, where the pollutions of
industry and commerce are relatively light. “Simplify, simplify,” Walden
advises, and we try, even though a twenty-first century attainment of a
rustic, elemental simplicity entails considerable complications of
budget and transport.</p>
<p>Thoreau would not scorn contemporary efforts to effect his gospel and
follow his example. Walden aims at conversion, and Thoreau’s polemical
purpose gives it an energy and drive missing in the meanders of the sole
other book he saw into publication during his short lifetime, A Week on
the Concord and Merrimack Rivers (1849). Like A Week, Walden is a
farraginous memoir, and was subject to Thoreau’s habit of constant
revision and expansion, going through seven known drafts, but it all
forms a defense of his eccentric reclusion. A vigorous, humorous tone
asserts itself at the outset:</p>
<p>I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers
if very particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning
my mode of life, which some would call impertinent, though they did not
appear to me at all impertinent, but, considering the circumstances,
very natural and pertinent.</p>
<p>The circumstances, a malaise of drudgery and petty distraction in the
society around him, are described, and his general wish “to live
deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I
could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die,
discover that I had not lived.” However, he passes over a very practical
motive: he wanted to be a writer and, like many another of like
ambition, needed privacy, quiet, and a “broad margin” where his mind
could roam.</p>
<p>He built a single-room cabin on his mentor Emerson’s land, more than
a mile south of Concord village, in the spring of 1845, and moved in on
July 4, declaring his own independence. In the next two years he
completed a draft, later expanded, of A Week on the Concord and
Merrimack Rivers, based on a canoe trip he and his brother John had
taken in 1839, as well as composing the first draft of Walden and a long
essay on Thomas Carlyle, part of which he gave as a lecture at the
Concord Lyceum in 1846. In July of 1846 he refused to pay his
accumulated town poll taxes, on the grounds that the national government
condoned and protected slavery, and spent one night in jail, thus laying
the basis for his celebrated essay “Civil Disobedience.” Later in that
same year he travelled for the first time to Maine and wrote most of the
essay “Ktaadn.” Thoreau was twenty-seven when he took up residence in
the cabin by Walden Pond; he had graduated from Harvard nineteenth in
his class, tried teaching, helped his father in the family pencil
business, did local odd jobs for a dollar a day, lived with the Emersons
for two years as handyman and gardener, left Long Island after a brief
spell of tutoring and testing the literary market, and, despite
Emerson’s sponsorship and a few poems and essays in the
Transcendentalist quarterly The Dial, had made no mark. He emerged from
the cabin in 1847 as essentially the Thoreau known to literary
history.</p>
<p>His appearance was sufficiently arresting to have attracted a number
of descriptions. The fastidious but not unfriendly Hawthorne, a sometime
resident of Concord, described him in 1842 as “a young man with much of
wild original nature still remaining in him…. He is as ugly as sin,
long-nosed, queer-mouthed, and with uncouth and somewhat rustic,
although courteous manners…. [He] seems inclined to lead a sort of
Indian life among civilized men—an Indian life, I mean, as respects the
absence of any systematic effort for a livelihood.” James Kendall Hosmer
recalled how an older Thoreau “stood in the doorway with hair which
looked as if it had been dressed with a pine-cone, inattentive grey
eyes, hazy with faraway musings, an emphatic nose and disheveled attire
that bore signs of tramps in woods and swamps.” His New Bedford disciple
Daniel Ricketson recalled, as phrased by Thoreau’s biographer Walter
Harding, “the gentleness, humanity, and intelligence of Thoreau’s blue
eyes” and noted that “though his arms were long, his legs short, his
hands and feet large, and his shoulders markedly sloping, he was strong
and vigorous in his walk.” His voice was impressive, even toward the
end, when tuberculosis had weakened it. On his last journey, a rather
desperate excursion to Minnesota for the possibly healing effects of its
supposedly drier climate, the minister upon whom he called in Chicago,
the Unitarian Robert Collyer, remembered:</p>
<p>His words also were as distinct and true to the ear as those of a
great singer…. He would hesitate for an instant now and then, waiting
for the right word, or would pause with a pathetic patience to master
the trouble in his chest, but when he was through the sentence was
perfect and entire, lacking nothing, and the word was so purely one with
the man that when I read his books now and then I do not hear my own
voice within my reading but the voice I heard that day.</p>
<p>How did Thoreau achieve his literary voice, which has worn better, to
a modern ear, than Emerson’s more fluent, worldly, and—to be expected
from a former clergyman—oratorical one? The outward sweep of Emerson’s
pithy, exhortative sentences rather wearies the reader now; we feel the
audience before him, basking as he beams epigrams and encouragements
into their faces. The mood of Thoreau is more interior; the eye is not
on an audience but on a multitudinous world of sensation, seen and named
with precision. Consider these sentences from near the beginning of A
Week:</p>
<p>We glided noiselessly down the stream, occasionally driving a
pickerel from the covert of the pads, or a bream from her nest, and the
smaller bittern now and then sailed away on sluggish wings from some
recess in the shore, or the larger lifted itself out of the long grass
at our approach, and carried its precious legs away to deposit them in a
place of safety. The tortoises also rapidly dropped into the water, as
our boat ruffled the surface amid the willows breaking the reflections
of the trees. The banks had passed the height of their beauty, and some
of the brighter flowers showed by their faded tints that the season was
verging towards the afternoon of the year; but this sombre tinge
enhanced their sincerity, and in the still unabated heats they seemed
like the mossy brink of some cool well.</p>
<p>All is limpid observation, gliding from one bittern to another, until
the startling remark that fading color enhanced the flowers’
“sincerity,” as if they have been pressing a case. The long paragraph
goes on to enumerate, with the Latin names, the flowers of the Concord
meadows, and ends with reminiscence of the mornings when the writer, on
the water before sunrise, witnessed the sudden opening of water lilies
to the touch of dawn sun, when “whole fields of white blossoms seemed to
flash open before me, as I floated along, like the unfolding of a
banner.” This is not exactly “nature writing,” though it holds the
freshness of a continent still being explored and catalogued, as by a
Humboldt or an Audubon; it is a live, particularized demonstration of
Emerson’s hopeful boast, set forward in its most theological form in his
slim first book, Nature, that “every natural fact is a symbol of some
spiritual fact”—that Nature is at bottom Spirit, that “Spirit alters,
moulds, makes it.” Emerson approvingly quoted Swedenborg’s “The visible
world and the relation of its parts, is the dial plate of the invisible”
and asserted, “The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics.”
Imbibing Idealism from Emerson, Thoreau soaked himself in Nature’s great
metaphor, and became a scientist of sorts—“a mystic, a
transcendentalist, and a natural philosopher to boot,” he later called
himself—and an autobiographer. He gathered, and transferred to journals
amounting in the end to two million words, rare moments and observations
of increasing refinement and subtlety, harvested where he would.
Emerson, like other respectable citizens of Concord, was skeptical of
enterprise so personal and quizzical, confiding to his journal that
“Thoreau wants a little ambition in his mixture…. Instead of being the
head of American engineers, he is captain of a huckleberry party.”
Thoreau’s taste for figurative huckleberry-gathering took him far
afield, walking Cape Cod’s wave-beaten coast and ascending to the stony
summit of Maine’s Mount Ktaadn, but he always returned to the little
wilderness of Concord, a microcosm that was cosmos enough.</p>
<p>F. O. Matthiessen, in his American Renaissance, points out how much
the great writers of that renaissance owed to the English writers of the
seventeenth century—Donne and Herbert, Marvell and Browne—with their
belief in correspondences between the little and the large, the inner
world of the self and the outer world of Nature. “The heart of man,”
Donne wrote, “Is an epitome of God’s great book / Of creatures, and man
need no farther look.” George Herbert put it, “Man is one world, and
hath / Another to attend him,” thus extending Nature into the unseen
realms of heavenly solicitude. By a great leap of kinship, the
metaphysicals of the seventeenth century ignited in the spiritual
descendents of seventeenth-century Puritans a blaze of introspectively
charged particulars.</p>
<p>Walden lives in its particulars. The long opening chapter, “Economy,”
joyously details just how to build a house—“a tight shingled and
plastered house, ten feet wide by fifteen long, and eight-feet posts,
with a garret and a closet, a large window on each side, two trap doors,
one door at the end, and a brick fireplace opposite”—down to a list of
expenses totalling 8.11½. Briskly marketing to the world his program of
austerity and self-reliance, he itemizes the few foodstuffs he paid for
and the profits he obtained from his seven miles of bean rows. He tells
us how to make his unleavened bread of rye and Indian meal, and “a very
good molasses either of pumpkin or beets.” In another experiment, he
eats a woodchuck, enjoying it “notwithstanding its musky flavor,” though
he doubts it will become an item for the village butcher. He shares the
details of his housekeeping with us:</p>
<p>Housework was a pleasant pastime. When my floor was dirty, I rose
early, and, setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass, bed and
bedstead making but one budget, dashed water on the floor, and sprinkled
white sand from the pond on it, and then with a broom scrubbed it clean
and white….</p>
<p>Further—and this is a stroke of his sensitive, pawky genius—he
contemplates his momentarily displaced furniture and the nuance of
enchanting strangeness:</p>
<p>It was pleasant to see my whole household effects out on the grass,
making a little pile like a gypsy’s pack, and my three-legged table,
from which I did not remove the books and pen and ink, standing amid the
pines and hickories…. It was worth the while to see the sun shine on
these things, and hear the free wind blow on them; so much more
interesting most familiar objects look out of doors than in the
house.</p>
<p>Many things, in Thoreau’s liberated state, are worth the while to
see—the feeding manners of chickadees, and the trickles of spring thaw
along the railroad cut, “resembling, as you look down on them, the
laciniated lobed and imbricated thalluses of some lichens.” At the same
moment he is “cheered by the music of a thousand tinkling rills and
rivulets whose veins are filled with the blood of winter which they are
bearing off”; at other times he eavesdrops on “the faint wiry peep” of
the baby woodcock being led by their mother through the swamp. In
Walden’s most bravura chapter, “Sounds,” he hears not only the cries and
rustles of myriad creatures but, with surprising approval, the whistle
and racket of the Fitchburg Railroad train as it makes its way, a
hundred rods off, along the edge of Walden Pond:</p>
<p>Commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene, alert, adventurous,
and unwearied. It is very natural in its methods withal, far more so
than many fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments…. I am
refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me, and I
smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long
Wharf to Lake Champlain.</p>
<p>His admiration of Nature is not selective; it includes the “iron
steed” that thrusts its noisy way into his woods, earning several pages
of paean capped by one of his best-known poems, beginning “What’s the
railroad to me? / I never go to see / Where it ends.”</p>
<p>The Concord of the 1840s, where, in Thoreau’s perception, men “lead
lives of quiet desperation,” slave-drivers of themselves with “no time
to be any thing but a machine,” was by our lights a bucolic world, the
steam engine being the technological ultimate and the main labor farm
labor. It is the farmer, according to Thoreau, whose “poor immortal
soul” is “well nigh crushed and smothered under its load, creeping down
the road of life, pushing before it a barn seventy-five feet by forty,
its Augean stables never cleansed”; it is a farmer he encounters in the
middle of the night, driving his livestock to a dawn appointment in
Boston, while the unencumbered hermit returns to sleep in his cozy
cabin. Thoreau was a Harvard graduate and the scion of a small
industrialist, John Thoreau the pencil-manufacturer. In the local social
scale he was something of a gentleman, and he asserts a gentleman’s
prerogative in pursuing his unprofitable hobbies. We slightly wince, on
behalf of those more tightly bound to laborious necessity, when we read
that “to maintain one’s self on this earth is not hardship but a
pastime, if we will live simply and wisely” and that “by working about
six weeks in a year, I could meet all the expenses of living.” Not
everyone is offered free land to squat on for a personal experiment nor
can draw so freely on the society of a nearby village. Thoreau makes
light of most men’s need to work, and ignores the wave of industrial
toil that is breaking upon New England. In his week on the Concord and
Merrimack Rivers he takes small note of the factories that made of this
river the New World’s first industrial zone, whose cruel exploitations
Melville sought to dramatize in his short story “The Tartarus of
Maids.”</p>
<p>Thoreau’s protest centers on the end-product of industry, the
consumerism that urges us to buy its products; his proposed remedy is
doing without: “A man is rich in proportion to the number of things
which he can afford to let alone.” This includes doing without sex (“The
generative energy, which, when we are loose, dissipates and makes us
unclean, when we are continent invigorates and inspires us”), and would
carry with it, as Hawthorne sensed, an end to most of the interactions
that form civilization, a return to “Indian life” and beyond—to a degree
of individual independence that no human society, least of all a tribal
one, could tolerate. His retreat to the cabin and the retreats to the
land that his masterwork has helped inspire were luxuries, financed by
the surplus that an interwoven, slave-driving economy generates. Even so
staunch a Thoreauvian as ?. B. White (whose own withdrawal to the Maine
coast was financed by the ad revenues of a New York magazine), in
writing a tribute for Walden’s hundredth anniversary fifty years ago,
admitted that “the plodding economist will … have rough going if he
hopes to emerge from the book with a clear system of economic thought,”
and that Thoreau sometimes wrote as if “all his readers were male,
unmarried, and well-connected.” But if it cannot be swallowed as a
cure-all, Walden can be relished as a condiment, a flavoring, a
head-clearing spice. White, remembering how the book heartened him when
he read it in his youth, saw Walden as “an invitation to life’s dance,
assuring the troubled recipient that… the music is played for him, too,
if he will but listen and move his feet.” “Love your life,” Thoreau
wrote, “poor as it is.”</p>
<p>Walden can be taken as an antidote to apathy and anxiety. With its
high spirits and keen appeals to the senses, it fortifies. Its time of
writing was a troubled time for Thoreau, young but old enough to have
accomplished more, and for the nation, laboring under the cloud of the
slavery issue and the coming Civil War. If Thoreau did not make much of
the industrial revolution, he felt the crisis in belief whereby even the
almost creedless stopgap of Unitarianism demanded too much faith. Nature
studies led to naturalism, to philosophical materialism. “Darwin, the
naturalist,” is cited early in Walden, as witness to those “inhabitants
of Tierra del Fuego” who went “naked with impunity, while the European
shivers in his clothes”—model citizens of Thoreau’s utopia of doing
without. Walter Harding’s biography, The Days of Henry Thoreau (1965),
tells us that the ailing Thoreau lived to read, in 1860, Darwin’s Origin
of Species, and “took six pages of notes on it in one of his commonplace
books, and… liked the book very much.” But the theological furor over
the book did not engage him, nor affect his own thinking. He had once
experienced, Walden confides, “a slight insanity in my mood” whereby
Nature seemed unfriendly, a mood quickly cancelled by a sense, in a
gentle rain, of “an infinite and unaccountable friendliness all at once
like an atmosphere sustaining me”: “There can be no very black
melancholy to him who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses
still.”</p>
<p>Thoreau resembled Darwin in his patient observations and Benjamin
Franklin in his inventive practicality. Unlike most Transcendentalists,
he could do things—tend garden and make home repairs for Emerson, or
actualize with real carpentry Bronson Alcott’s fanciful vision of a
summerhouse. “I have as many trades as fingers,” he says in Walden.
Between 1849 and 1861 he completed over two hundred surveys, mostly in
and around Concord. He figures in Henry Petroski’s technological history
of the pencil (The Pencil, 1990) as the inventor, not long after his
graduation from Harvard, of a seven-foot-high grinding machine that
captured only the particles of graphite fine enough to rise highest into
the air; for a time, Thoreau pencils were the best—the least gritty—in
America. We trust the narrator of Walden and his spiritual aspirations
better because of repeated examples of his practical know-how. A call to
ethereality begins with a trick of fitting an ax tight to its
handle:</p>
<p>One day, when my axe had come off and I had cut a green hickory for a
wedge, driving it with a stone, and had placed the whole to soak in a
pond hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a striped snake run into the
water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without inconvenience, as
long as I staid there, or more than a quarter of an hour; perhaps
because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared
to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and
primitive condition; but if they should feel the influence of the spring
of springs arousing them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and
more ethereal life.</p>
<p>Surviving in the woods, he becomes a student of physical process.
Water swells wood; dead leaves absorb the sun’s heat: “The elements…
abetted me in making a path through the deepest snow in the woods, for
when I had once gone through the wind blew the oak leaves into my
tracks, where they lodged, and by absorbing the rays of the sun melted
the snow, and so not only made a dry bed for my feet, but in the night
their dark line was my guide.” The pond covered with winter ice moves
him to especially close observation; as he had anatomized the spring
thaw, so the winter freezing prompts his minute inspection of bubbles,
“narrow oblong perpendicular bubbles about half an inch long, sharp
cones with the apex upward.” In a warm spell, they expand and run
together, “often like slivery coins poured from a bag, one overlapping
another”; at the end of the passage he lifts his almost microscopic
examination of “the infinite number of minute bubbles” into the
resounding open: “These are the little air-guns which contribute to make
the ice crack and whoop.” He veers close to the secret of microörganisms
when he asks, “Why is it that a bucket of water soon becomes putrid, but
frozen remains sweet forever?” The question evaporates, however, in the
dry witticism, “It is commonly said that this is the difference between
the affections and the intellect.”</p>
<p>As the railroad cuts expose new geology, the commercial ice-cutting
in the winter of 1846-47 gives Thoreau new opportunities for perceiving
ice, remarking distinctions in tint as precisely as the contemporary
landscapist Frederic Edwin Church rendered icebergs. Early in 1846,
Thoreau seized the opportunity of a frozen Walden to perform the chief
technical labor of his years there. “With compass and chain and sounding
line,” cutting holes in straight lines in several directions, he sounds
the pond, presenting the reader with a drawn map, forty rods to an inch,
and a scale profile of the bottom. The pond had been long rumored to be
bottomless: “It is remarkable how long men will believe in the
bottomlessness of a pond without taking the trouble to sound it.” The
surveyor is proud to announce, “I can assure my readers that Walden has
a reasonably tight bottom at a not unreasonable, though at an unusual,
depth.” Ponds are shallower than we imagine: “Most ponds, emptied, would
leave a meadow no more hollow than we frequently see.” Most mysteries,
by the same token, yield to the emptying action of patient scientific
examination. Readers new to Walden may be surprised at the high
proportion of its energy given to empirical exploration and
demonstration. The Romantic Nature-celebrant wears the polished
spectacles of Franklin and the philosophes. Thoreau’s purpose is to
reconcile us, after centuries of hazy anthropocentricity, to Nature as
it is, relentless and remorseless. We need to be called out from the
shared comforts and illusions of village life.</p>
<p>We need the tonic of wildness…. We can never have enough of Nature.
We must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor, vast and
Titanic features…. We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and
some life pasturing freely where we never wander. We are cheered when we
observe the vulture feeding on the carrion which disgusts and
disheartens us and deriving health and strength from the repast.</p>
<p>On the path to his little cabin, he relates, there was a dead horse,
whose aroma repulsed him but heartened him with “the assurance it gave
me of the strong appetite and inviolable health of Nature.” The vision
of “Nature red in tooth and claw,” which desolated Tennyson and other
Victorian Christians, is embraced by Thoreau:</p>
<p>I love to see that Nature is so rife with life that myriads can be
afforded to be sacrificed and suffered to prey on one another; that
tender organizations can be so serenely squashed out of existence like
pulp—tadpoles which herons gobble up, and tortoises and toads run over
in the road; and that sometimes it has rained flesh and blood! With the
liability to accident, we must see how little account is to be made of
it. The impression made on a wise man is that of universal innocence….
Compassion is a very untenable ground.</p>
<p>He sounds, as it were, the fatal bottom of our organic existence, and
yet claims not merely to accept the universe, as another
Transcendentalist, Margaret Fuller, put it, but to rejoice in it.</p>
<p>He met his own death, at forty-four, of consumption, with a serenity
admired by much of Concord. “One world at a time,” he famously told
those seeking to prepare him for the next. He did not quite renounce
personal immortality; a number of his phrases tease the possibility, and
near the passages above he evokes the “wild river valley and the woods…
bathed in so pure and bright a light as would have waked the dead,”
concluding, “There needs no stronger proof of the immortality. All
things must live in such a light.” Yet the meaning is unclear, a fillip
of animal optimism after a book-length, clear-eyed exaltation of Nature
as a chemical and molecular and mathematical construct—Nature seized in
the tightening grip of science, and stripped of the pathetic fallacy
even in the sophisticated form in which Emerson’s Neoplatonism couched
it. No more Idealism, no more Platonic forms, no shimmering archetypes
having an existence somehow independent of individual things. “No ideas
but in things,” William Carlos Williams would say in the next century,
giving modernism a motto. The poetry of Williams and Eliot and Pound
demonstrated that things, assembled even as enigmatic fragments, as
images without spelled-out emotional and logical connectives, give
vitality to the language and immediacy to the communication between
writer and reader. It is the thinginess of Thoreau’s prose that still
excites us, the athleticism with which he springs from detail to detail,
image to image, while still toting something of Transcendentalism’s
metaphysical burden. Without that burden, which is considerably lighter
in the writings posthumously collected as The Maine Woods and Cape Cod,
he comes close to being merely an attentive and eloquent travel writer.
Nevertheless, the chaotic, mist-swept top of Mount Ktaadn—“the raw
materials of a planet dropped from an unseen quarry”—and the wrecks and
wind-stunted apple trees of Cape Cod afford us the metaphysical shudder
of a man confronting in implacable nature an image of something
purifyingly bleak within himself.</p>
<p>His later years, as the preachments of abolitionists and slaveholders
reached their shrill adumbration of bloody war, were marked, even made
notorious, by his fiery championing of John Brown, whom he had briefly
met in Concord, finding him “a man of great common sense, deliberate and
practical,” endowed with “tact and prudence” and the Spartan habits and
spare diet of a soldier. The peaceable Thoreau extols this grim killer
for a practical reason: Brown has taken action, violent action, against
the sanctioned violence of the slavery-protecting state:</p>
<p>It was his peculiar doctrine that a man has a perfect right to
interfere by force with the slaveholder, in order to rescue the slave. I
agree with him…. I do not wish to kill nor to be killed, but I can
foresee circumstances in which both these things would be by me
unavoidable. We preserve the so-called “peace” of our community by deeds
of petty violence every day.</p>
<p>Thoreau’s recognitions endeared him to the revolutionaries of the
1960s: he saw the violence behind the established order, the enslaving
nature of private property, and—a trend even stronger now than forty
years ago—the media’s substitution of “the news” for private reality.
“Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is
fabulous.” The word “reality” rings through Walden: “Let us settle
ourselves, and work and wedge our feet downward through the mud and
slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition, and delusion, and
appearance… till we come to a hard bottom and rocks in place, which we
can call reality…. Be it life or death, we crave only reality. If we are
really dying, let us hear the rattle in our throats and feel cold in the
extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our business.” To the dark
immensity of material Nature’s indifference we can oppose only the brief
light, like a lamp in a cabin, of our consciousness; the invigorating
benison of Walden is to make us feel that the contest is equal, and
fair.</p>
<p>The United States of 1850, at twenty-three millions, was small enough
to be addressed as a single congregation. Though famous as the man who
lived alone in the woods, as Melville was as “the man who had lived
among cannibals,” Thoreau was in his gingerly fashion gregarious.
Visiting his friends the Loomises in Cambridge, he was once handed, in
1856, and for an awkward moment was compelled to hold, upside down, the
newborn Mabel Loomis, who was to achieve fame as the first editor of
Emily Dickinson’s poetry and, in the twentieth century, as a leading
instance, in Peter Gay’s social history The Tender Passion, of the
sexually fulfilled and unrepressed Victorian female. In 1852 Thoreau,
already acquainted with most of New England’s writers, visited Walt
Whitman in Brooklyn, in the bedroom where Whitman lived in slovenly
style with his feeble-minded brother. Although they differed in their
estimate of the common man, so that Whitman later diagnosed the Yankee
as having “a very aggravated case of superciliousness,” and Thoreau
pronunced some of the New Yorker’s poems as “disagreeable to say the
least, simply sensual… as if the beasts spoke,” both were left with
favourable impressions. “He is a great fellow,” Thoreau wrote of Whitman
in a letter, and of his book of poems, “On the whole it sounds to me
very brave andandandand American after whatever deductions. I do not
believe that all the sermons so called that have been preached in this
land put together are equal to it for preaching.” Leaves of Grass and
Walden have emerged over time as the two great testaments of American
individualism, assuring the New World, traditional reassurances failing,
of the value, power, and beauty of the unfettered self.</p>
