<h4 id="chapter-x-the-end-of-the-islander">Chapter X The End of the
Islander</h4>
<p>Our meal was a merry one. Holmes coud talk exceedingly well when he
chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of
nervous exaltation. I have never known him so brilliant. He spoke on a
quick succession of subjects,–on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery, on
Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the war-ships of
the future,– handling each as though he had made a special study of it.
His bright humor marked the reaction from his black depression of the
preceding days. Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours
of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant. For
myself, I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our
task, and I caught something of Holmes’s gaiety. None of us alluded
during dinner to the cause which had brought us together.</p>
<p>When the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled
up three glasses with port. “One bumper,“ said he, “to the success of
our little expedition. And now it is high time we were off. Have you a
pistol, Watson?“</p>
<p>“I have my old service-revolver in my desk.“</p>
<p>“You had best take it, then. It is well to be prepared. I see that
the cab is at the door. I ordered it for half-past six.“</p>
<p>It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf,
and found our launch awaiting us. Holmes eyed it critically.</p>
<p>“Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?“</p>
<p>“Yes,–that green lamp at the side.“</p>
<p>“Then take it off.“</p>
<p>The small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were
cast off. Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern. There was one man at
the rudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors
forward.</p>
<p>“Where to?“ asked Jones.</p>
<p>“To the Tower. Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson’s Yard.“</p>
<p>Our craft was evidently a very fast one. We shot past the long lines
of loaded barges as though they were stationary. Holmes smiled with
satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind
us.</p>
<p>“We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,“ he said.</p>
<p>“Well, hardly that. But there are not many launches to beat us.“</p>
<p>“We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a
clipper. I will tell you how the land lies, Watson. You recollect how
annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical
analysis. One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work
is the best rest. So it is. When I had succeeded in dissolving the
hydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the
Sholtos, and thought the whole matter out again. My boys had been up the
river and down the river without result. The launch was not at any
landing-stage or wharf, nor had it returned. Yet it could hardly have
been scuttled to hide their traces,–though that always remained as a
possible hypothesis if all else failed. I knew this man Small had a
certain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of
anything in the nature of delicate finesse. That is usually a product of
higher education. I then reflected that since he had certainly been in
London some time–as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch
over Pondicherry Lodge–he could hardly leave at a moment’s notice, but
would need some little time, if it were only a day, to arrange his
affairs. That was the balance of probability, at any rate.“</p>
<p>“It seems to me to be a little weak,“ said I. “It is more probable
that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his
expedition.“</p>
<p>“No, I hardly think so. This lair of his would be too valuable a
retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he
could do without it. But a second consideration struck me. Jonathan
Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,
however much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and
possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy. He was quite sharp
enough to see that. They had started from their head-quarters under
cover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad
light. Now, it was past three o’clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when
they got the boat. It would be quite bright, and people would be about
in an hour or so. Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far. They
paid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final
escape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure- box. In a
couple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,
and whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under
cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no
doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the
Colonies.“</p>
<p>“But the launch? They could not have taken that to their
lodgings.“</p>
<p>“Quite so. I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in
spite of its invisibility. I then put myself in the place of Small, and
looked at it as a man of his capacity would. He would probably consider
that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit
easy if the police did happen to get on his track. How, then, could he
conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted? I wondered what
I should do myself if I were in his shoes. I could only think of one way
of doing it. I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or
repairer, with directions to make a trifling change in her. She would
then be removed to his shed or yard, and so be effectually concealed,
while at the same time I could have her at a few hours’ notice.“</p>
<p>“That seems simple enough.“</p>
<p>“It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be
overlooked. However, I determined to act on the idea. I started at once
in this harmless seaman’s rig and inquired at all the yards down the
river. I drew blank at fifteen, but at the sixteenth–Jacobson’s–I
learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a
wooden-legged man, with some trivial directions as to her rudder. ‘There
ain’t naught amiss with her rudder,’ said the foreman. ‘There she lies,
with the red streaks.’ At that moment who should come down but Mordecai
Smith, the missing owner? He was rather the worse for liquor. I should
not, of course, have known him, but he bellowed out his name and the
name of his launch. ‘I want her to-night at eight o’clock,’ said
he,–‘eight o’clock sharp, mind, for I have two gentlemen who won’t be
kept waiting.’ They had evidently paid him well, for he was very flush
of money, chucking shillings about to the men. I followed him some
distance, but he subsided into an ale-house: so I went back to the yard,
and, happening to pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as
a sentry over the launch. He is to stand at water’s edge and wave his
handkerchief to us when they start. We shall be lying off in the stream,
and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and
all.“</p>
<p>“You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men
or not,“ said Jones; “but if the affair were in my hands I should have
had a body of police in Jacobson’s Yard, and arrested them when they
came down.“</p>
<p>“Which would have been never. This man Small is a pretty shrewd
fellow. He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him
suspicious lie snug for another week.“</p>
<p>“But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their
hiding-place,“ said I.</p>
<p>“In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a
hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live. As long as he has
liquor and good pay, why should he ask questions? They send him messages
what to do. No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the
best.“</p>
<p>While this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the
long series of bridges which span the Thames. As we passed the City the
last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of
St. Paul’s. It was twilight before we reached the Tower.</p>
<p>“That is Jacobson’s Yard,“ said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of
masts and rigging on the Surrey side. “Cruise gently up and down here
under cover of this string of lighters.“ He took a pair of night-glasses
from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. “I see my sentry at
his post,“ he remarked, “but no sign of a handkerchief.“</p>
<p>“Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,“
said Jones, eagerly. We were all eager by this time, even the policemen
and stokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.</p>
<p>“We have no right to take anything for granted,“ Holmes answered. “It
is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be
certain. From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they
can hardly see us. It will be a clear night and plenty of light. We must
stay where we are. See how the folk swarm over yonder in the
gaslight.“</p>
<p>“They are coming from work in the yard.“</p>
<p>“Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little
immortal spark concealed about him. You would not think it, to look at
them. There is no a priori probability about it. A strange enigma is
man!“</p>
<p>“Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,“ I suggested.</p>
<p>“Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,“ said Holmes. “He remarks
that, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate
he becomes a mathematical certainty. You can, for example, never
foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what
an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages
remain constant. So says the statistician. But do I see a handkerchief?
Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.“</p>
<p>“Yes, it is your boy,“ I cried. “I can see him plainly.“</p>
<p>“And there is the Aurora,“ exclaimed Holmes, “and going like the
devil! Full speed ahead, engineer. Make after that launch with the
yellow light. By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to
have the heels of us!“</p>
<p>She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind
two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before
we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore,
going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and shook his
head.</p>
<p>“She is very fast,“ he said. “I doubt if we shall catch her.“</p>
<p>“We MUST catch her!“ cried Holmes, between his teeth. “Heap it on,
stokers! Make her do all she can! If we burn the boat we must have
them!“</p>
<p>We were fairly after her now. The furnaces roared, and the powerful
engines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart. Her sharp,
steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to
right and to left of us. With every throb of the engines we sprang and
quivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows threw
a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us. Right ahead a dark
blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of white
foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going. We flashed
past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind this one and
round the other. Voices hailed us out of the darkness, but still the
Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her track.</p>
<p>“Pile it on, men, pile it on!“ cried Holmes, looking down into the
engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,
aquiline face. “Get every pound of steam you can.“</p>
<p>“I think we gain a little,“ said Jones, with his eyes on the
Aurora.</p>
<p>“I am sure of it,“ said I. “We shall be up with her in a very few
minutes.“</p>
<p>At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with
three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting our
helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could round
them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards.
She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain twilight
was setting into a clear starlit night. Our boilers were strained to
their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce
energy which was driving us along. We had shot through the Pool, past
the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up again after
rounding the Isle of Dogs. The dull blur in front of us resolved itself
now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light
upon her, so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One
man sat by the stern, with something black between his knees over which
he stooped. Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland
dog. The boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace
I could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for
dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were
really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and turning
which they took there could no longer be any question about it. At
Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At Blackwall we
could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I have coursed many
creatures in many countries during my checkered career, but never did
sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the
Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard by yard. In the silence of
the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery. The
man in the stern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving
as though he were busy, while every now and then he would look up and
measure with a glance the distance which still separated us. Nearer we
came and nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop. We were not more than
four boat’s lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace.
It was a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and
the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in
the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at
us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,
powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could
see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the
right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was movement
in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened itself into a
little black man–the smallest I have ever seen–with a great, misshapen
head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair. Holmes had already drawn
his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage,
distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or
blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough to
give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen features so deeply
marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small eyes glowed and burned
with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from his
teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.</p>
<p>“Fire if he raises his hand,“ said Holmes, quietly. We were within a
boat’s-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can
see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs far
apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous
face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our
lantern.</p>
<p>It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he
plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like a
school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out together.
He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of choking cough
fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of his venomous,
menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At the same moment the
wooden- legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down,
so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank, while we shot
past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet. We were round after her
in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank. It was a wild and
desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of
marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying
vegetation. The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank, with
her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water. The fugitive
sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the
sodden soil. In vain he struggled and writhed. Not one step could he
possibly take either forwards or backwards. He yelled in impotent rage,
and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot, but his
struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank.
When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it
was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were
able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our
side. The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but
came aboard meekly enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled
off and made fast to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship
stood upon the deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that
had contained the ill- omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key,
but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to our
own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we flashed our
search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of the Islander.
Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of
that strange visitor to our shores.</p>
<p>“See here,“ said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. “We were
hardly quick enough with our pistols.“ There, sure enough, just behind
where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we
knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we
fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy
fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible
death which had passed so close to us that night.</p>
