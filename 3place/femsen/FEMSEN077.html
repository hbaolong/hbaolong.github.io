<h4 id="the-adventure-of-the-second-stain">THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND
STAIN</h4>
<p>I had intended “The Adventure of the Abbey Grange“ to be the last of
those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever
communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any
lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which
I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the
part of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of
this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance which
Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences. So
long as he was in actual professional practice the records of his
successes were of some practical value to him, but since he has
definitely retired from London and betaken himself to study and
bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become hateful to him,
and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should
be strictly observed. It was only upon my representing to him that I had
given a promise that “The Adventure of the Second Stain“ should be
published when the times were ripe, and pointing out to him that it is
only appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in
the most important international case which he has ever been called upon
to handle, that I at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a
carefully guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before
the public. If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in
certain details, the public will readily understand that there is an
excellent reason for my reticence.</p>
<p>It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be
nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors
of European fame within the walls of our humble room in Baker Street.
The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant, was none other
than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. The
other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and
endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was the Right Honourable
Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs, and the most rising
statesman in the country. They sat side by side upon our paper-littered
settee, and it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it
was business of the most pressing importance which had brought them. The
Premier’s thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory
head of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from
Holmes to me. The European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache
and fidgeted with the seals of his watch-chain.</p>
<p>“When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o’clock
this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his
suggestion that we have both come to you.“</p>
<p>“Have you informed the police?“</p>
<p>“No, sir,“ said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner
for which he was famous. “We have not done so, nor is it possible that
we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to
inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to avoid.“</p>
<p>“And why, sir?“</p>
<p>“Because the document in question is of such immense importance that
its publication might very easily–I might almost say probably–lead to
European complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to say
that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery can be
attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be recovered
at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its
contents should be generally known.“</p>
<p>“I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if
you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document
disappeared.“</p>
<p>“That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter–for it
was a letter from a foreign potentate–was received six days ago. It was
of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but have taken
it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace, and kept it in
my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last night. Of that I
am certain. I actually opened the box while I was dressing for dinner
and saw the document inside. This morning it was gone. The despatch-box
had stood beside the glass upon my dressing-table all night. I am a
light sleeper, and so is my wife. We are both prepared to swear that no
one could have entered the room during the night. And yet I repeat that
the paper is gone.“</p>
<p>“What time did you dine?“</p>
<p>“Half-past seven.“</p>
<p>“How long was it before you went to bed?“</p>
<p>“My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was
half-past eleven before we went to our room.“</p>
<p>“Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?“</p>
<p>“No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the house-maid in
the morning, and my valet, or my wife’s maid, during the rest of the
day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time.
Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was
anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my
despatch-box.“</p>
<p>“Who did know of the existence of that letter?“</p>
<p>“No one in the house.“</p>
<p>“Surely your wife knew?“</p>
<p>“No, sir. I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this
morning.“</p>
<p>The Premier nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>“I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,“ said
he. “I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it
would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties.“</p>
<p>The European Secretary bowed.</p>
<p>“You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never
breathed one word to my wife upon this matter.“</p>
<p>“Could she have guessed?“</p>
<p>“No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed–nor could anyone have
guessed.“</p>
<p>“Have you lost any documents before?“</p>
<p>“No, sir.“</p>
<p>“Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this
letter?“</p>
<p>“Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday, but the
pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased by
the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good heavens,
to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost it!“ His
handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his hands tore
at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man,
impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the aristocratic mask was
replaced, and the gentle voice had returned. “Besides the members of the
Cabinet there are two, or possibly three, departmental officials who
know of the letter. No one else in England, Mr. Holmes, I assure
you.“</p>
<p>“But abroad?“</p>
<p>“I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it.
I am well convinced that his Ministers–that the usual official channels
have not been employed.“</p>
<p>Holmes considered for some little time.</p>
<p>“Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is,
and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?“</p>
<p>The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier’s shaggy
eyebrows gathered in a frown.</p>
<p>“Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour.
There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is
addressed in large, bold handwriting to—-“</p>
<p>“I fear, sir,“ said Holmes, “that, interesting and indeed essential
as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of things.
What WAS the letter?“</p>
<p>“That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I
cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of the
powers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as I
describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved well of your
country, and earned any reward which it lies in our power to
bestow.“</p>
<p>Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.</p>
<p>“You are two of the most busy men in the country,“ said he, “and in
my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret
exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any continuation
of this interview would be a waste of time.“</p>
<p>The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his
deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. “I am not accustomed,
sir,“ he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his seat. For a
minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old statesman shrugged
his shoulders.</p>
<p>“We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and
it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our
entire confidence.“</p>
<p>“I agree with you,“ said the younger statesman.</p>
<p>“Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of
your colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for I
could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this
affair should come out.“</p>
<p>“You may safely trust us.“</p>
<p>“The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been
ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It has
been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.
Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter. At
the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain
phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its publication
would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this
country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesitate to
say that within a week of the publication of that letter this country
would be involved in a great war.“</p>
<p>Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the
Premier.</p>
<p>“Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter–this letter which may well
mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred
thousand men–which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion.“</p>
<p>“Have you informed the sender?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched.“</p>
<p>“Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.“</p>
<p>“No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already
understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner. It
would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if this
letter were to come out.“</p>
<p>“If this is so, whose interest is it that, the letter should come
out? Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?“</p>
<p>“There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international
politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no
difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed
camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military
power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into war
with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other
confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?“</p>
<p>“Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this
potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach
between his country and ours?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of
an enemy?“</p>
<p>“To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding
on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take
it.“</p>
<p>Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud.
The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>“It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in
full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?“</p>
<p>Holmes shook his head mournfully.</p>
<p>“You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be
war?“</p>
<p>“I think it is very probable.“</p>
<p>“Then, sir, prepare for war.“</p>
<p>“That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.“</p>
<p>“Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after
eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife
were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It
was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and
eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it
evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early
as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at
that hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to retain it. It
has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What chance have we now
to overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our reach.“</p>
<p>The Prime Minister rose from the settee.</p>
<p>“What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the
matter is indeed out of our hands.“</p>
<p>“Let us presume, for argument’s sake, that the document was taken by
the maid or by the valet—-“</p>
<p>“They are both old and tried servants.“</p>
<p>“I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that
there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could go
up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has taken it.
To whom would the thief take it? To one of several international spies
and secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar to me. There are
three who may be said to be the heads of their profession. I will begin
my research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post.
If one is missing–especially if he has disappeared since last night–we
will have some indication as to where the document has gone.“</p>
<p>“Why should he be missing?“ asked the European Secretary. “He would
take the letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not.“</p>
<p>“I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations
with the Embassies are often strained.“</p>
<p>The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.</p>
<p>“I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a
prize to headquarters with his own hands. I think that your course of
action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all our
other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be any
fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you
will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.“</p>
<p>The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.</p>
<p>When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in
silence and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had opened
the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had
occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an exclamation,
sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>“Yes,“ said he, “there is no better way of approaching it. The
situation is desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be sure
which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet
passed out of his hands. After all, it is a question of money with these
fellows, and I have the British treasury behind me. If it’s on the
market I’ll buy it–if it means another penny on the income-tax. It is
conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come
from this side before he tries his luck on the other. There are only
those three capable of playing so bold a game–there are Oberstein, La
Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. I will see each of them.“</p>
<p>I glanced at my morning paper.</p>
<p>“Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?“</p>
<p>“Yes.“</p>
<p>“You will not see him.“</p>
<p>“Why not?“</p>
<p>“He was murdered in his house last night.“</p>
<p>My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures
that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely I
had astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the paper
from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged in
reading when he rose from his chair.</p>
