<h4 id="the-adventure-of-shoscombe-old-place">The Adventure of Shoscombe
Old Place</h4>
<p>Sherlock Holmes had been bending for a long time over a low-power
microscope. Now he straightened himself up and looked round at me in
triumph.</p>
<p>“It is glue, Watson,“ said he. “Unquestionably it is glue. Have a
look at these scattered objects in the field!“</p>
<p>I stooped to the eyepiece and focussed for my vision.</p>
<p>“Those hairs are threads from a tweed coat. The irregular gray masses
are dust. There are epithelial scales on the left. Those brown blobs in
the centre are undoubtedly glue.“</p>
<p>“Well,“ I said, laughing, “I am prepared to take your word for it.
Does anything depend upon it?“</p>
<p>“It is a very fine demonstration,“ he answered. “In the St. Pancras
case you may remember that a cap was found beside the dead policeman.
The accused man denies that it is his. But he is a picture-frame maker
who habitually handles glue.“</p>
<p>“Is it one of your cases?“</p>
<p>“No; my friend, Merivale, of the Yard, asked me to look into the
case. Since I ran down that coiner by the zinc and copper filings in the
seam of his cuff they have begun to realize the importance of the
microscope.“ He looked impatiently at his watch. “I had a new client
calling, but he is overdue. By the way, Watson, you know something of
racing?“</p>
<p>“I ought to. I pay for it with about half my wound pension.“</p>
<p>“Then I’ll make you my ‘Handy Guide to the Turf.’ What about Sir
Robert Norberton? Does the name recall anything?“</p>
<p>“Well, I should say so. He lives at Shoscombe Old Place, and I know
it well, for my summer quarters were down there once. Norberton nearly
came within your province once.“</p>
<p>“How was that?“</p>
<p>“It was when he horsewhipped Sam Brewer, the well-known Curzon Street
money-lender, on Newmarket Heath. He nearly killed the man.“</p>
<p>“Ah, he sounds interesting! Does he often indulge in that way?“</p>
<p>“Well, he has the name of being a dangerous man. He is about the most
daredevil rider in England – second in the Grand National a few years
back. He is one of those men who have overshot their true generation. He
should have been a buck in the days of the Regency – a boxer, an
athlete, a plunger on the turf, a lover of fair ladies, and, by all
account, so far down Queer Street that he may never find his way back
again.“</p>
<p>“Capital, Watson! A thumb-nail sketch. I seem to know the man. Now,
can you give me some idea of Shoscombe Old Place?“</p>
<p>“Only that it is in the centre of Shoscombe Park, and that the famous
Shoscombe stud and training quarters are to be found there.“</p>
<p>“And the head trainer,“ said Holmes, “is John Mason. You need not
look surprised at my knowledge, Watson, for this is a letter from him
which I am unfolding. But let us have some more about Shoscombe. I seem
to have struck a rich vein.“</p>
<p>“There are the Shoscombe spaniels,“ said I. “You hear of them at
every dog show. The most exclusive breed in England. They are the
special pride of the lady of Shoscombe Old Place.“</p>
<p>“Sir Robert Norberton’s wife, I presume!“</p>
<p>“Sir Robert has never married. Just as well, I think, considering his
prospects. He lives with his widowed sister, Lady Beatrice Falder.“</p>
<p>“You mean that she lives with him?“</p>
<p>“No, no. The place belonged to her late husband, Sir James. Norberton
has no claim on it at all. It is only a life interest and reverts to her
husband’s brother. Meantime, she draws the rents every year.“</p>
<p>“And brother Robert, I suppose, spends the said rents?“</p>
<p>“That is about the size of it. He is a devil of a fellow and must
lead her a most uneasy life. Yet I have heard that she is devoted to
him. But what is amiss at Shoscombe?“</p>
<p>“Ah, that is just what I want to know. And here, I expect, is the man
who can tell us.“</p>
<p>The door had opened and the page had shown in a tall, clean-shaven
man with the firm, austere expression which is only seen upon those who
have to control horses or boys. Mr. John Mason had many of both under
his sway, and he looked equal to the task. He bowed with cold
self-possession and seated himself upon the chair to which Holmes had
waved him.</p>
<p>“You had my note, Mr. Holmes?“</p>
<p>“Yes, but it explained nothing.“</p>
<p>“It was too delicate a thing for me to put the details on paper. And
too complicated. It was only face to face I could do it.“</p>
<p>“Well, we are at your disposal.“</p>
<p>“First of all, Mr. Holmes, I think that my employer, Sir Robert, has
gone mad.“</p>
<p>Holmes raised his eyebrows. “This is Baker Street, not Harley
Street,“ said he. “But why do you say so?“</p>
<p>“Well, sir, when a man does one queer thing, or two queer things,
there may be a meaning to it, but when everything he does is queer, then
you begin to wonder. I believe Shoscombe Prince and the Derby have
turned his brain.“</p>
<p>“That is a colt you are running?“</p>
<p>“The best in England, Mr. Holmes. I should know, if anyone does. Now,
I’ll be plain with you, for I know you are gentlemen of honour and that
it won’t go beyond the room. Sir Robert has got to win this Derby. He’s
up to the neck, and it’s his last chance. Everything he could raise or
borrow is on the horse–and at fine odds, too! You can get forties now,
but it was nearer the hundred when he began to back him.“</p>
<p>“But how is that if the horse is so good?“</p>
<p>“The public don’t know how good he is. Sir Robert has been too clever
for the touts. He has the Prince’s half-brother out for spins. You can’t
tell ’em apart. But there are two lengths in a furlong between them when
it comes to a gallop. He thinks of nothing but the horse and the race.
His whole life is on it. He’s holding off the Jews till then. If the
Prince fails him he is done. “</p>
<p>“It seems a rather desperate gamble, but where does the madness come
in?“</p>
<p>“Well, first of all, you have only to look at him. I don’t believe he
sleeps at night. He is down at the stables at all hours. His eyes are
wild. It has all been too much for his nerves. Then there is his conduct
to Lady Beatrice!“</p>
<p>“Ah! What is that?“</p>
<p>“They have always been the best of friends. They had the same tastes,
the two of them, and she loved the horses as much as he did. Every day
at the same hour she would drive down to see them – and, above all, she
loved the Prince. He would prick up his ears when he heard the wheels on
the gravel, and he would trot out each morning to the carriage to get
his lump of sugar. But that’s all over now.“</p>
<p>“Why?“</p>
<p>“Well, she seems to have lost all interest in the horses. For a week
now she has driven past the stables with never so much as
‘Good-morning’! “</p>
<p>“You think there has been a quarrel?“</p>
<p>“And a bitter, savage, spiteful quarrel at that. Why else would he
give away her pet spaniel that she loved as if he were her child? He
gave it a few days ago to old Barnes, what keeps the Green Dragon, three
miles off, at Crendall.“</p>
<p>“That certainly did seem strange.“</p>
<p>“Of course, with her weak heart and dropsy one couldn’t expect that
she could get about with him, but he spent two hours every evening in
her room. He might well do what he could, for she has been a rare good
friend to him. But that’s all over, too. He never goes near her. And she
takes it to heart. She is brooding and sulky and drinking, Mr. Holmes –
drinking like a fish.“</p>
<p>“Did she drink before this estrangement?“</p>
<p>“Well, she took her glass, but now it is often a whole bottle of an
evening. So Stephens, the butler, told me. It’s all changed, Mr. Holmes,
and there is something damned rotten about it. But then, again, what is
master doing down at the old church crypt at night? And who is the man
that meets him there?“</p>
<p>Holmes rubbed his hands.</p>
<p>“Go on, Mr. Mason. You get more and more interesting.“</p>
<p>“It was the butler who saw him go. Twelve o’clock at night and
raining hard. So next night I was up at the house and, sure enough,
master was off again. Stephens and I went after him, but it was jumpy
work, for it would have been a bad job if he had seen us. He’s a
terrible man with his fists if he gets started, and no respecter of
persons. So we were shy of getting too near, but we marked him down all
light. It was the haunted crypt that he was making for, and there was a
man waiting for him there.“</p>
<p>“What is this haunted crypt?“</p>
<p>“Well, sir, there is an old ruined chapel in the park. It is so old
that nobody could fix its date. And under it there’s a crypt which has a
bad name among us. It’s a dark, damp, lonely place by day, but there are
few in that county that would have the nerve to go near it at night. But
master’s not afraid. He never feared anything in his life. But what is
he doing there in the night-time?“</p>
<p>“Wait a bit!“ said Holmes. “You say there is another man there. It
must be one of your own stablemen, or someone from the house! Surely you
have only to spot who it is and question him?“</p>
<p>“It’s no one I know.“</p>
<p>“How can you say that?“</p>
<p>“Because I have seen him, Mr. Holmes. It was on that second night.
Sir Robert turned and passed us – me and Stephens, quaking in the bushes
like two bunny-rabbits, for there was a bit of moon that night. But we
could hear the other moving about behind. We were not afraid of him. So
we up when Sir Robert was gone and pretended we were just having a walk
like in the moonlight, and so we came right on him as casual and
innocent as you please. ‘Hullo, mate! who may you be?’ says I. I guess
he had not heard us coming, so he looked over his shoulder with a face
as if he had seen the devil coming out of hell. He let out a yell, and
away he went as hard as he could lick it in the darkness. He could run!
– I’ll give him that. In a minute he was out of sight and hearing, and
who he was, or what he was, we never found.“</p>
<p>“But you saw him clearly in the moonlight?“</p>
<p>“Yes, I would swear to his yellow face – a mean dog, I should say.
What could he have in common with Sir Robert?“</p>
<p>Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.</p>
<p>“Who keeps Lady Beatrice Falder company?“ he asked at last.</p>
<p>“There is her maid, Carrie Evans. She has been with her this five
years.“</p>
<p>“And is, no doubt, devoted?“</p>
<p>Mr. Mason shuffled uncomfortably.</p>
<p>“She’s devoted enough,“ he answered at last. “But I won’t say to
whom.“</p>
<p>“Ah!“ said Holmes.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell tales out of school.“</p>
<p>“I quite understand, Mr. Mason. Of course, the situation is clear
enough. From Dr. Watson’s description of Sir Robert I can realize that
no woman is safe from him. Don’t you think the quarrel between brother
and sister may lie there?“</p>
<p>“Well, the scandal has been pretty clear for a long time.“</p>
<p>“But she may not have seen it before. Let us suppose that she has
suddenly found it out. She wants to get rid of the woman. Her brother
will not permit it. The invalid, with her weak heart and inability to
get about, has no means of enforcing her will. The hated maid is still
tied to her. The lady refuses to speak, sulks, takes to drink. Sir
Robert in his anger takes her pet spaniel away from her. Does not all
this hang together?“</p>
<p>“Well, it might do – so far as it goes.“</p>
<p>“Exactly! As far as it goes. How would all that bear upon the visits
by night to the old crypt? We can’t fit that into our plot.“</p>
<p>“No, sir, and there is something more that I can’t fit in. Why should
Sir Robert want to dig up a dead body?“</p>
<p>Holmes sat up abruptly.</p>
<p>“We only found it out yesterday – after I had written to you.
Yesterday Sir Robert had gone to London, so Stephens and I went down to
the crypt. It was all in order, sir, except that in one corner was a bit
of a human body.“</p>
<p>“You informed the police, I suppose?“</p>
<p>Our visitor smiled grimly.</p>
<p>“Well, sir, I think it would hardly interest them. It was just the
head and a few bones of a mummy. It may have been a thousand years old.
But it wasn’t there before. That I’ll swear, and so will Stephens. It
had been stowed away in a corner and covered over with a board, but that
corner had always been empty before.“</p>
<p>“What did you do with it?“</p>
<p>“Well, we just left it there.“</p>
<p>“That was wise. You say Sir Robert was away yesterday. Has he
returned?“</p>
<p>“We expect him back to-day.“</p>
<p>“When did Sir Robert give away his sister’s dog?“</p>
<p>“It was just a week ago to-day. The creature was howling outside the
old wellhouse, and Sir Robert was in one of his tantrums that morning.
He caught it up, and I thought he would have killed it. Then he gave it
to Sandy Bain, the jockey, and told him to take the dog to old Barnes at
the Green Dragon, for he never wished to see it again.“</p>
<p>Holmes sat for some time in silent thought. He had lit the oldest and
foulest of his pipes.</p>
<p>“I am not clear yet what you want me to do in this matter,
Mr. Mason,“ he said at last. “Can’t you make it more definite?“</p>
<p>“Perhaps this will make it more definite, Mr. Holmes,“ said our
visltor.</p>
<p>He took a paper from his pocket, and, unwrapping it carefully, he
exposed a charred fragment of bone.</p>
<p>Holmes examined it with interest.</p>
<p>“Where did you get it?“</p>
<p>“There is a central heating furnace in the cellar under Lady
Beatrice’s room. It’s been off for some time, but Sir Robert complained
of cold and had it on again.</p>
<p>“Harvey runs it – he’s one of my lads. This very morning he came to
me with this which he found raking out the cinders. He didn’t like the
look of it.“</p>
<p>“Nor do I,“ said Holmes. “What do you make of it, Watson?“</p>
<p>It was burned to a black cinder, but there could be no question as to
its anatomical significance.</p>
<p>“It’s the upper condyle of a human femur,“ said I.</p>
<p>“Exactly!“ Holmes had become very serious. “When does this lad tend
to the furnace?“</p>
<p>“He makes it up every evening and then leaves it.“</p>
<p>“Then anyone could visit it during the night?“</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.“</p>
<p>“Can you enter it from outside?“</p>
<p>“There is one door from outside. There is another which leads up by a
stair to the passage in which Lady Beatrice’s room is situated.“</p>
<p>“These are deep waters, Mr. Mason; deep and rather dirty. You say
that Sir Robert was not at home last night?“</p>
<p>“No, sir.“</p>
<p>“Then, whoever was burning bones, it was not he.“</p>
<p>“That’s true. sir.“</p>
<p>“What is the name of that inn you spoke of?“</p>
<p>“The Green Dragon.“</p>
<p>“Is there good fishing in that part of Berkshire?“ The honest trainer
showed very clearly upon his face that he was convinced that yet another
lunatic had come into his harassed life.</p>
<p>“Well, sir, I’ve heard there are trout in the mill-stream and pike in
the Hall lake.“</p>
<p>“That’s good enough. Watson and I are famous fishermen -are we not,
Watson? You may address us in future at the Green Dragon. We should
reach it to-night. I need not say that we don’t want to see you,
Mr. Mason, but a note will reach us, and no doubt I could find you if I
want you. When we have gone a little farther into the matter I will let
you have a considered opinion.“</p>
<p>Thus it was that on a bright May evening Holmes and I found ourselves
alone in a first-class carriage and bound for the little
“halt-on-demand“ station of Shoscombe. The rack above us was covered
with a formidable litter of rods, reels, and baskets. On reaching our
destination a short drive took us to an old-fashioned tavern, where a
sporting host, Josiah Barnes, entered eagerly into our plans for the
extirpation of the fish of the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>“What about the Hall lake and the chance of a pike?“ said Holmes.</p>
<p>The face of the innkeeper clouded.</p>
<p>“That wouldn’t do, sir. You might chance to find yourself in the lake
before you were through.“</p>
<p>“How’s that, then?“</p>
<p>“It’s Sir Robert, sir. He’s terrible jealous of touts. If you two
strangers were as near his training quarters as that he’d be after you
as sure as fate. He ain’t taking no chances, Sir Robert ain’t.“</p>
<p>“I’ve heard he has a horse entered for the Derby.“</p>
<p>“Yes, and a good colt, too. He carries all our money for the race,
and all Sir Robert’s into the bargain. By the way“ – he looked at us
with thoughtful eyes – “I suppose you ain’t on the turf yourselves?“</p>
<p>“No, indeed. Just two weary Londoners who badly need some good
Berkshire air.“</p>
<p>“Well, you are in the right place for that. There is a deal of it
lying about. But mind what I have told you about Sir Robert. He’s the
sort that strikes first and speaks afterwards. Keep clear of the
park.“</p>
<p>“Surely, Mr. Barnes! We certainly shall. By the way, that was a most
beautiful spaniel that was whining in the hall.“</p>
<p>“I should say it was. That was the real Shoscombe breed. There ain’t
a better in England.“</p>
<p>“I am a dog-fancier myself,“ said Holmes. “Now, if it is a fair
question, what would a prize dog like that cost?“</p>
<p>“More than I could pay, sir. It was Sir Robert himself who gave me
this one. That’s why I have to keep it on a lead. It would be off to the
Hall in a jiffy if I gave it its head.“</p>
<p>“We are getting some cards in our hand, Watson,“ said Holmes when the
landlord had left us. “It’s not an easy one to play, but we may see our
way in a day or two. By the way, Sir Robert is still in London, I hear.
We might, perhaps, enter the sacred domain to-night without fear of
bodily assault. There are one or two points on which I should like
reassurance.“</p>
<p>“Have you any theory, Holmes?“</p>
<p>“Only this, Watson, that something happened a week or so ago which
has cut deep into the life of the Shoscombe household. What is that
something? We can only guess at it from its effects. They seem to be of
a curiously mixed character. But that should surely help us. It is only
the colourless, uneventful case which is hopeless.</p>
<p>“Let us consider our data. The brother no longer visits the beloved
invalid sister. He gives away her favourite dog. Her dog, Watson! Does
that suggest nothing to you?“</p>
<p>“Nothing but the brother’s spite.“</p>
<p>“Well, it might be so. Or – well, there is an alternative. Now to
continue our review of the situation from the time that the quarrel, if
there is a quarrel, began. The lady keeps her room, alters her habits,
is not seen save when she drives out with her maid, refuses to stop at
the stables to greet her favourite horse and apparently takes to drink.
That covers the case, does it not?“</p>
<p>“Save for the business in the crypt.“</p>
<p>“That is another line of thought. There are two, and I beg you will
not tangle them. Line A, which concerns Lady Beatrice, has a vaguely
sinister flavour, has it not?“</p>
<p>“I can make nothing of it.“</p>
<p>“Well, now, let us take up line B, which concerns Sir Robert. He is
mad keen upon winning the Derby. He is in the hands of the Jews, and may
at any moment be sold up and his racing stables seized by his creditors.
He is a daring and desperate man. He derives his income from his sister.
His sister’s maid is his willing tool. So far we seem to be on fairly
safe ground, do we not?“</p>
<p>“But the crypt?“</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, the crypt! Let us suppose, Watson – it is merely a
scandalous supposition, a hypothesis put forward for argument’s sake –
that Sir Robert has done away with his sister.“</p>
<p>“My dear Holmes, it is out of the question.“</p>
<p>“Very possibly, Watson. Sir Robert is a man of an honourable stock.
But you do occasionally find a carrion crow among the eagles. Let us for
a moment argue upon this supposition. He could not fly the country until
he had realized his fortune, and that fortune could only be realized by
bringing off this coup with Shoscombe Prince. Therefore, he has still to
stand his ground. To do this he would have to dispose of the body of his
victim, and he would also have to find a substitute who would
impersonate her. With the maid as his confidante that would not be
impossible. The woman’s body might be conveyed to the crypt, which is a
place so seldom visited, and it might be secretly destroyed at night in
the furnace, leaving behind it such evidence as we have already seen.
What say you to that, Watson?“</p>
<p>“Wel], it is all possible if you grant the original monstrous
supposition.“</p>
<p>“I think that there is a small experiment which we may try to-morrow,
Watson, in order to throw some light on the matter. Meanwhile, if we
mean to keep up our characters, I suggest that we have our host in for a
glass of his own wine and hold some high converse upon eels and dace,
which seems to be the straight road to his affections. We may chance to
come upon some useful local gossip in the process.“</p>
<p>In the morning Holmes discovered that we had come without our
spoon-bait for jack, which absolved us from fishing for the day. About
eleven o’clock we started for a walk, and he obtained leave to take the
black spaniel with us.</p>
<p>“This is the place,“ said he as we came to two high park gates with
heraldic griffins towering above them. “About midday, Mr Barnes informs
me, the old lady takes a drive, and the carriage must slow down while
the gates are opened. When it comes through, and before it gathers
speed, I want you, Watson, to stop the coachman with some question.
Never mind me. I shall stand behind this holly-bush and see what I can
see.“</p>
<p>It was not a long vigil. Within a quarter of an hour we saw the big
open yellow barouche coming down the long avenue, with two splendid,
high-stepping gray carriage horses in the shafts. Holmes crouched behind
his bush with the dog. I stood unconcemedly swinging a cane in the
roadway. A keeper ran out and the gates swung open.</p>
<p>The carriage had slowed to a walk, and I was able to get a good look
at the occupants. A highly coloured young woman with flaxen hair and
impudent eyes sat on the left. At her right was an elderly person with
rounded back and a huddle of shawls about her face and shoulders which
proclaimed the invalid. When the horses reached the highroad I held up
my hand with an authoritative gesture, and as the coachman pulled up I
inquired if Sir Robert was at Shoscombe Old Place.</p>
<p>At the same moment Holmes stepped out and released the spaniel. With
a joyous cry it dashed forward to the carriage and sprang upon the step.
Then in a moment its eager greeting changed to furious rage, and it
snapped at the black skirt above it.</p>
<p>“Drive on! Drive on!“ shrieked a harsh voice. The coachman lashed the
horses, and we were left standing in the roadway.</p>
<p>“Well, Watson, that’s done it,“ said Holmes as he fastened the lead
to the neck of the excited spaniel. “He thought it was his mistress, and
he found it was a stranger. Dogs don’t make mistakes.“</p>
<p>“But it was the voice of a man!“ I cried.</p>
<p>“Exactly! We have added one card to our hand, Watson, but it needs
careful playing, all the same.“</p>
<p>My companion seemed to have no further plans for the day, and we did
actually use our fishing tackle in the mill-stream with the result that
we had a dish of trout for our supper. It was only after that meal that
Holmes showed signs of renewed activity. Once more we found ourselves
upon the same road as in the morning, which led us to the park gates. A
tall, dark figure was awaiting us there, who proved to be our London
acquaintance, Mr. John Mason, the trainer.</p>
<p>“Good-evening, gentlemen,“ said he. “I got your note, Mr. Holmes. Sir
Robert has not returned yet, but I hear that he is expected
to-night.“</p>
<p>“How far is this crypt from the house?“ asked Holmes.</p>
<p>“A good quarter of a mile.“</p>
<p>“Then I think we can disregard him altogether.“</p>
<p>“I can’t afford to do that, Mr. Holmes. The moment he arrives he will
want to see me to get the last news of Shoscombe Prince.“</p>
<p>“I see! In that case we must work without you, Mr. Mason. You can
show us the crypt and then leave us.“</p>
<p>It was pitch-dark and without a moon, but Mason led us over the
grass-lands until a dark mass loomed up in front of us which proved to
be the ancient chapel. We entered the broken gap which was once the
porch, and our guide, stumbling among heaps of loose masonry, picked his
way to the corner of the building, where a steep stair led down into the
crypt. Striking a match, he illuminated the melancholy place – dismal
and evil-smelling, with ancient crumbling walls of rough-hewn stone, and
piles of coffins, some of lead and some of stone, extending upon one
side right up to the arched and groined roof which lost itself in the
shadows above our heads. Holmes had lit his lantern, which shot a tiny
tunnel of vivid yellow light upon the mournful scene. Its rays were
reflected back from the coffin-plates, many of them adorned with the
griffin and coronet of this old family which carried its honours even to
the gate of Death.</p>
<p>“You spoke of some bones, Mr. Mason. Could you show them before you
go?“</p>
<p>“They are here in this corner.“ The trainer strode across and then
stood in silent surprise as our light was turned upon the place. “They
are gone,“ said he.</p>
<p>“So I expected,“ said Holmes, chuckling. “I fancy the ashes of them
might even now be found in that oven which had already consumed a
part.“</p>
<p>“But why in the world would anyone want to burn the bones of a man
who has been dead a thousand years?“ asked John Mason.</p>
<p>“That is what we are here to find out,“ said Holmes. “It may mean a
long search, and we need not detain you. I fancy that we shall get our
solution before morning.“</p>
<p>When John Mason had left us, Holmes set to work making a very careful
examination of the graves, ranging from a very ancient one, which
appeared to be Saxon, in the centre, through a long line of Norman Hugos
and Odos, until we reached the Sir William and Sir Denis Falder of the
eighteenth century. It was an hour or more before Holmes came to a
leaden coffin standing on end before the entrance to the vault. I heard
his little cry of satisfaction and was aware from his hurried but
purposeful movements that he had reached a goal. With his lens he was
eagerly examining the edges of the heavy lid. Then he drew from his
pocket a short jemmy, a box-opener, which he thrust into a chink,
levering back the whole front, which seemed to be secured by only a
couple of clamps. There was a rending, tearing sound as it gave way, but
it had hardly hinged back and partly revealed the contents before we had
an unforeseen interruption.</p>
<p>Someone was walking in the chapel above. It was the firm, rapid step
of one who came with a definite purpose and knew well the ground upon
which he walked. A light streamed down the stairs, and an instant later
the man who bore it was framed in the Gothic archway. He was a terrible
figure, huge in stature and fierce in manner. A large stable-lantern
which he held in front of him shone upward upon a strong, heavily
moustached face and angry eyes, which glared round him into every recess
of the vault, finally fixing themselves with a deadly stare upon my
companion and myself.</p>
<p>“Who the devil are you?“ he thundered. “And what are you doing upon
my property?“ Then, as Holmes returned no answer he took a couple of
steps forward and raised a heavy stick which he carried. “Do you hear
me?“ he cried. “Who are you? What are you doing here?“ His cudgel
quivered in the air.</p>
<p>But instead of shrinking Holmes advanced to meet him.</p>
<p>“I also have a question to ask you, Sir Robert,“ he said in his
sternest tone. “Who is this? And what is it doing here?“</p>
<p>He turned and tore open the coffin-lid behind him. In the glare of
the lantern I saw a body swathed in a sheet from head to foot with
dreadful, witch-like features, all nose and chin, projecting at one end,
the dim, glazed eyes staring from a discoloured and crumbling face.</p>
<p>The baronet had staggered back with a cry and supported himself
against a stone sarcophagus.</p>
<p>“How came you to know of this?“ he cried. And then, with some return
of his truculent manner: “What business is it of yours?“</p>
<p>“My name is Sherlock Holmes,“ said my companion. “Possibly it is
familiar to you. In any case, my business is that of every other good
citizen – to uphold the law. It seems to me that you have much to answer
for.“</p>
<p>Sir Robert glared for a moment, but Holmes’s quiet voice and cool,
assured manner had their effect.</p>
<p>“ ’Fore God, Mr. Holmes, it’s all right,“ said he. “Appearances are
against me, I’ll admit, but I could act no otherwise.“</p>
<p>“I should be happy to think so, but I fear your explanations must be
before the police.“</p>
<p>Sir Robert shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>
<p>“Well, if it must be, it must. Come up to the house and you can judge
for yourself how the matter stands.“</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later we found ourselves in what I judge, from
the lines of polished barrels behind glass covers, to be the gun-room of
the old house. It was comfortably furnished, and here Sir Robert left us
for a few moments. When he returned he had two companions with him; the
one, the florid young woman whom we had seen in the carriage; the other,
a small rat-faced man with a disagreeably furtive manner. These two wore
an appearance of utter bewilderment, which showed that the baronet had
not yet had time to explain to them the turn events had taken.</p>
<p>“There,“ said Sir Robert with a wave of his hand, “are Mr. and
Mrs. Norlett. Mrs. Norlett, under her maiden name of Evans, has for some
years been my sister’s confidential maid. I have brought them here
because I feel that my best course is to explain the true position to
you, and they are the two people upon earth who can substantiate what I
say.“</p>
<p>“Is this necessary, Sir Robert? Have you thought what you are doing?“
cried the woman.</p>
<p>“As to me, I entirely disclaim all responsibility,“ said her
husband.</p>
<p>Sir Robert gave him a glance of contempt. “I will take all
responsibility,“ said he. “Now, Mr. Holmes, listen to a plain statement
of the facts.</p>
<p>“You have clearly gone pretty deeply into my affairs or I should not
have found you where I did. Therefore, you know already, in all
probability, that I am running a dark horse for the Derby and that
everything depends upon my success. If I win, all is easy. If I lose –
well, I dare not think of that!“</p>
<p>“I understand the position,“ said Holmes.</p>
<p>“I am dependent upon my sister, Lady Beatrice, for everything. But it
is well known that her interest in the estate is for her own life only.
For myself, I am deeply in the hands of the Jews. I have always known
that if my sister were to die my creditors would be on to my estate like
a flock of vultures. Everything would be seized – my stables, my horses
– everything. Well, Mr. Holmes, my sister did die just a week ago.“</p>
<p>“And you told no one!“</p>
<p>“What could I do? Absolute ruin faced me. If I could stave things off
for three weeks all would be well. Her maid’s husband – this man here –
is an actor. It came into our heads – it came into my head – that he
could for that short period personate my sister. It was but a case of
appearing daily in the carriage, for no one need enter her room save the
maid. It was not difficult to arrange. My sister died of the dropsy
which had long afflicted her.“</p>
<p>“That will be for a coroner to decide.“</p>
<p>“Her doctor would certify that for months her symptoms have
threatened such an end.“</p>
<p>“Well, what did you do?“</p>
<p>“The body could not remain there. On the first night Norlett and I
carried it out to the old well-house, which is now never used. We were
followed, however, by her pet spaniel, which yapped continually at the
door, so I felt some safer place was needed. I got rid of the spaniel,
and we carried the body to the crypt of the church. There was no
indignity or irreverence, Mr. Holmes. I do not feel that I have wronged
the dead.“</p>
<p>“Your conduct seems to me inexcusable, Sir Robert.“</p>
<p>The baronet shook his head impatiently. “It is easy to preach,“ said
he. “Perhaps you would have felt differently if you had been in my
position. One cannot see all one’s hopes and all one’s plans shattered
at the last moment and make no effort to save them. It seemed to me that
it would be no unworthy resting-place if we put her for the time in one
of the coffins of her husband’s ancestors lying in what is still
consecrated ground. We opened such a coffin, removed the contents, and
placed her as you have seen her. As to the old relics which we took out,
we could not leave them on the floor of the crypt. Norlett and I removed
them, and he descended at night and burned them in the central furnace.
There is my story, Mr. Holmes, though how you forced my hand so that I
have to tell it is more than I can say.“</p>
<p>Holmes sat for some time lost in thought.</p>
<p>“There is one flaw in your narrative, Sir Robert,“ he said at last.
“Your bets on the race, and therefore your hopes for the future, would
hold good even if your creditors seized your estate.“</p>
<p>“The horse would be part of the estate. What do they care for my
bets? As likely as not they would not run him at all. My chief creditor
is, unhappily, my most bitter enemy – a rascally fellow, Sam Brewer,
whom I was once compelled to horsewhip on Newmarket Heath. Do you
suppose that he would try to save me?“</p>
<p>“Well, Sir Robert,“ said Holmes, rising, “this matter must, of
course, be referred to the police. It was my duty to bring the facts to
light, and there I must leave it. As to the morality or decency of your
conduct, it is not for me to express an opinion. It is nearly midnight,
Watson, and I think we may make our way back to our humble abode.“</p>
<p>It is generally known now that this singular episode ended upon a
happier note than Sir Robert’s actions deserved. Shoscombe Prince did
win the Derby, the sporting owner did net eighty thousand pounds in
bets, and the creditors did hold their hand until the race was over,
when they were paid in full, and enough was left to reestablish Sir
Robert in a fair position in life. Both police and coroner took a
lenient view of the transaction, and beyond a mild censure for the delay
in registering the lady’s decease, the lucky owner got away scatheless
from this strange incident in a career which has now outlived its
shadows and promises to end in an honoured old age.</p>

<p>Arthur Conan Doyle</p>
<p>Life | Death | Bibliography | Holmes books | Challenger stories |
Historical novels | Other works</p>
<p>Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle, DL (22 May 1859 - 7 July 1930) was a
British author most noted for his stories about the detective Sherlock
Holmes, which are generally considered a major innovation in the field
of crime fiction, and for the adventures of Professor Challenger. He was
a prolific writer whose other works include science fiction stories,
historical novels, plays and romances, poetry, and non-fiction.</p>
<p>Life</p>
<p>Arthur Conan Doyle was born on 22 May 1859, in Edinburgh, Scotland,
to an English father, Charles Altamont Doyle, and an Irish mother, Mary
Foley, who had married in 1855. Although he is now referred to as “Conan
Doyle“, the origin of this compound surname is uncertain. Conan Doyle’s
father was an artist, as were his paternal uncles (one of whom was
Richard Doyle), and his paternal grandfather John Doyle.</p>
<p>Conan Doyle was sent to the Roman Catholic Jesuit preparatory school
Hodder Place, Stonyhurst, at the age of eight. He then went on to
Stonyhurst College, but by the time he left the school in 1875, he had
rejected Christianity to become an agnostic.</p>
<p>From 1876 to 1881 he studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh,
including a period working in the town of Aston (now a district of
Birmingham). While studying, he also began writing short stories; his
first published story appeared in Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal before he
was 20. Following his term at university, he served as a ship’s doctor
on a voyage to the West African coast. He completed his doctorate on the
subject of tabes dorsalis in 1885.</p>
<p>In 1882, he joined former classmate George Budd as his partner at a
medical practice in Plymouth, but their relationship proved difficult,
and Conan Doyle soon left to set up an independent practice. Arriving in
Portsmouth in June of that year with less than £10 to his name, he set
up a medical practice at 1 Bush Villas in Elm Grove, Southsea. The
practice was initially not very successful; while waiting for patients,
he again began writing stories. His first significant work was A Study
in Scarlet, which appeared in Beeton’s Christmas Annual for 1887 and
featured the first appearance of Sherlock Holmes, who was partially
modelled after his former university professor, Joseph Bell. Future
short stories featuring Sherlock Holmes were published in the English
Strand Magazine. Interestingly, Rudyard Kipling congratulated Conan
Doyle on his success, asking “Could this be my old friend, Dr. Joe?“
Sherlock Holmes, however, was even more closely modelled after the
famous Edgar Allan Poe character, C. Auguste Dupin.</p>
<p>While living in Southsea he played football for an amateur side (that
disbanded in 1894), Portsmouth Association Football Club, as a goal
keeper. (This club had no connection with the Portsmouth F.C. of today.)
Conan Doyle was also a keen cricketer, and between 1900 and 1907 he
played 10 first-class matches for the MCC. His highest score was 43
against London County in 1902. He was an occasional bowler who took just
one first-class wicket.</p>
<p>In 1885, he married Louisa (or Louise) Hawkins, known as “Touie“, who
suffered from tuberculosis and died on 4 July 1906. He married Jean
Leckie in 1907, whom he had first met and fallen in love with in 1897
but had maintained a platonic relationship with her out of loyalty to
his first wife. Conan Doyle had five children, two with his first wife
(Mary Louise (born 1889) and Alleyne Kingsley (1892 - 1918)) and three
with his second wife (Jean Lena Annette, Denis Percy Stewart (17 March
1909 - 9 March 1955), second husband in 1936 of Georgian Princess Nina
Mdivani (circa 1910 - 19 February 1987) (former sister-in-law of Barbara
Hutton), and Adrian Malcolm).</p>
<p>In 1890, Conan Doyle studied the eye in Vienna; he moved to London in
1891 to set up a practice as an ophthalmologist. He wrote in his
autobiography that not a single patient crossed his door. This gave him
more time for writing, and in November 1891 he wrote to his mother: “I
think of slaying Holmes.. and winding him up for good and all. He takes
my mind from better things.“ His mother responded, saying, “You may do
what you deem fit, but the crowds will not take this lightheartedly.“ In
December 1893, he did so in order to dedicate more of his time to more
“important“ works (his historical novels).</p>
<p>Holmes and Moriarty apparently plunged to their deaths together down
a waterfall in the story, “The Final Problem“. Public outcry led him to
bring the character back; Conan Doyle returned to the story in “The
Adventure of the Empty House“, with the explanation that only Moriarty
had fallen but, since Holmes had other dangerous enemies, he had
arranged to be temporarily “dead“ also. Holmes ultimately appears in a
total of 56 short stories and four Conan Doyle novels (he has since
appeared in many novels and stories by other authors).</p>
<p>Following the Boer War in South Africa at the turn of the 20th
century and the condemnation from around the world over the United
Kingdom’s conduct, Conan Doyle wrote a short pamphlet titled, The War in
South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct, which justified the UK’s role in
the Boer war, and was widely translated.</p>
<p>Conan Doyle believed that it was this pamphlet that resulted in 1902
in his being knighted and appointed Deputy-Lieutenant of Surrey. He also
in 1900 wrote the longer book, The Great Boer War. During the early
years of the 20th century, Sir Arthur twice ran for Parliament as a
Liberal Unionist, once in Edinburgh and once in the Hawick Burghs, but
although he received a respectable vote he was not elected.</p>
<p>Conan Doyle was involved in the campaign for the reform of the Congo
Free State, led by the journalist E. D. Morel and the diplomat Roger
Casement. He wrote The Crime of the Congo in 1909, a long pamphlet in
which he denounced the horrors in that country. He became acquainted
with Morel and Casement, taking inspiration from them for two of the
main characters in the novel, The Lost World (1912).</p>
<p>He broke with both when Morel became one of the leaders of the
pacifist movement during the First World War, and when Casement
committed treason against the UK during the Easter Rising out of
conviction for his Irish nationalist views. Conan Doyle tried,
unsuccessfully, to save Casement from the death penalty, arguing that he
had been driven mad and was not responsible for his actions.</p>
<p>Conan Doyle was also a fervent advocate of justice, and personally
investigated two closed cases, which led to two imprisoned men being
released. The first case, in 1906, involved a shy half-British,
half-Indian lawyer named George Edalji, who had allegedly penned
threatening letters and mutilated animals. Police were set on Edalji’s
conviction, even though the mutilations continued after their suspect
was jailed.</p>
<p>It was partially as a result of this case that the Court of Criminal
Appeal was established in 1907, so not only did Conan Doyle help George
Edalji, his work helped establish a way to correct other miscarriages of
justice. The story of Conan Doyle and Edalji is told in fictional form
in Julian Barnes’ 2005 novel, Arthur andandandand George.</p>
<p>The second case, that of Oscar Slater, a German Jew and gambling-den
operator convicted of bludgeoning an 82-year-old woman in Glasgow in
1908, excited Conan Doyle’s curiosity because of inconsistencies in the
prosecution case and a general sense that Slater was framed.</p>
<p>After the death of his wife Louisa in 1906, and the deaths of his son
Kingsley, his brother Innes, his two brothers-in-law, and his two
nephews shortly after World War I, Conan Doyle sank into depression. He
found solace supporting Spiritualism and its alleged scientific proof of
existence beyond the grave.</p>
<p>According to the History Channel program Houdini: Unlocking the
Mystery (which briefly explored the friendship between the two), Conan
Doyle became involved with Spiritualism after the deaths of his son and
his brother. Kingsley Doyle died from pneumonia on 28 October 1918,
which he contracted during his convalescence after being seriously
wounded during the 1916 Battle of the Somme. Brigadier-General Innes
Doyle died in February 1919, also from pneumonia. Sir Arthur became
involved with Spiritualism to the extent that he wrote a Professor
Challenger novel on the subject, The Land of Mist.</p>
<p>His book, The Coming of the Fairies (1921) shows he was apparently
convinced of the veracity of the Cottingley Fairies photographs, which
he reproduced in the book, together with theories about the nature and
existence of fairies and spirits.</p>
<p>In his The History of Spiritualism (1926) Conan Doyle praised the
psychic phenomena and spirit materialisations produced by Eusapia
Palladino and Mina “Margery“ Crandon.</p>
<p>His work on this topic was one of the reasons that one of his short
story collections, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, was banned in the
Soviet Union in 1929 for supposed occultism. This ban was later lifted.
Russian actor Vasily Livanov later received an Order of the British
Empire for his portrayal of Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p>Conan Doyle was friends for a time with the American magician Harry
Houdini, who himself became a prominent opponent of the Spiritualist
movement in the 1920s following the death of his beloved mother.
Although Houdini insisted that Spiritualist mediums employed trickery
(and consistently attempted to expose them as frauds), Conan Doyle
became convinced that Houdini himself possessed supernatural powers, a
view expressed in Conan Doyle’s The Edge of the Unknown. Houdini was
apparently unable to convince Conan Doyle that his feats were simply
magic tricks, leading to a bitter public falling out between the
two.</p>
<p>Richard Milner, an American historian of science, has presented a
case that Conan Doyle may have been the perpetrator of the Piltdown Man
hoax of 1912, creating the counterfeit hominid fossil that fooled the
scientific world for over 40 years. Milner says that Conan Doyle had a
motive, namely revenge on the scientific establishment for debunking one
of his favourite psychics, and that The Lost World contains several
encrypted clues regarding his involvement in the hoax.</p>
<p>Samuel Rosenberg’s 1974 book Naked is the Best Disguise purports to
explain how Conan Doyle left, throughout his writings, open clues that
related to hidden and suppressed aspects of his mentality.</p>
<p>Death</p>
<p>Conan Doyle was found clutching his chest in the family garden on 7
July 1930. He soon died of his heart attack, aged 71, and is buried in
the Church Yard at Minstead in the New Forest, Hampshire, England. His
last words were directed toward his wife: “You are wonderful.“ The
epitaph on his gravestone reads:</p>
<p>STEEL TRUE</p>
<p>BLADE STRAIGHT</p>
<p>ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE</p>
<p>KNIGHT</p>
<p>PATRIOT, PHYSICIAN andandandand MAN OF LETTERS</p>
<p>Undershaw, the home Conan Doyle had built near Hindhead, south of
London, and lived in for at least a decade, was a hotel and restaurant
from 1924 until 2004. It was then bought by a developer, and has been
empty since then while conservationists and Conan Doyle fans fight to
preserve it.</p>
<p>A statue honours Conan Doyle at Crowborough Cross in Crowborough,
East Sussex, England, where Sir Arthur lived for 23 years. There is also
a statue of Sherlock Holmes in Picardy Place, Edinburgh, Scotland, close
to the house where Conan Doyle was born.</p>
