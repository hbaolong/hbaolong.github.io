<p>X34</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>In April, Animal Farm was proclaimed a Republic, and it became
necessary to elect a President. There was only one candidate, Napoleon,
who was elected unanimously. On the same day it was given out that fresh
documents had been discovered which revealed further details about
Snowball’s complicity with Jones. It now appeared that Snowball had not,
as the animals had previously imagined, merely attempted to lose the
Battle of the Cowshed by means of a stratagem, but had been openly
fighting on Jones’s side. In fact, it was he who had actually been the
leader of the human forces, and had charged into battle with the words
“Long live Humanity!“ on his lips. The wounds on Snowball’s back, which
a few of the animals still remembered to have seen, had been inflicted
by Napoleon’s teeth.</p>
<p>In the middle of the summer Moses the raven suddenly reappeared on
the farm, after an absence of several years. He was quite unchanged,
still did no work, and talked in the same strain as ever about
Sugarcandy Mountain. He would perch on a stump, flap his black wings,
and talk by the hour to anyone who would listen.</p>
<p>“Up there, comrades,“ he would say solemnly, pointing to the sky with
his large beak−“up there, just on the other side of that dark cloud that
you can see−there it lies, Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where
we poor animals shall rest for ever from our labours!“ He even claimed
to have been there on one of his higher flights, and to have seen the
everlasting fields of clover and the linseed cake and lump sugar growing
on the hedges. Many of the animals believed him. Their lives now, they
reasoned, were hungry and laborious; was it not right and just that a
better world should exist somewhere else? A thing that was difficult to
determine was the attitude of the pigs towards Moses. They all declared
contemptuously that his stories about Sugarcandy Mountain were lies, and
yet they allowed him to remain on the farm, not working, with an
allowance of a gill of beer a day.</p>
<p>After his hoof had healed up, Boxer worked harder than ever. Indeed,
all the animals worked like slaves that year. Apart from the regular
work of the farm, and the rebuilding of the windmill, there was the
schoolhouse for the young pigs, which was started in March. Sometimes
the long hours on insufficient food were hard to bear, but Boxer never
faltered. In nothing that he said or did was there any sign that his
strength was not what it had been. It was only his appearance that was a
little altered; his hide was less shiny than it had used to be, and his
great haunches seemed to have shrunken. The others said, “Boxer will
pick up when the spring grass comes on“; but the spring came and Boxer
grew no fatter. Sometimes on the slope leading to the top of the quarry,
when he braced his muscles against the weight of some vast boulder, it
seemed that nothing kept him on his feet except the will to continue. At
such times his lips were seen to form the words, “I will work harder“;
he had no voice left. Once again Clover and Benjamin warned him to take
care of his health, but Boxer paid no attention. His twelfth birthday
was approaching. He did not care what happened so long as a good store
of stone was accumulated before he went on pension.</p>
<p>Late one evening in the summer, a sudden rumour ran round the farm
that something had happened to Boxer. He had gone out alone to drag a
load of stone down to the windmill. And sure enough, the rumour was
true. A few minutes later two pigeons came racing in with the news:
“Boxer has fallen! He is lying on his side and can’t get up!“</p>
<p>About half the animals on the farm rushed out to the knoll where the
windmill stood. There lay Boxer, between the shafts of the cart, his
neck stretched out, unable even to raise his head. His eyes were glazed,
his sides matted with sweat. A thin stream of blood had trickled out of
his mouth. Clover dropped to her knees at his side.</p>
<p>“Boxer!“ she cried, “how are you?“</p>
<p>“It is my lung,“ said Boxer in a weak voice. “It does not matter. I
think you will be able to finish the windmill without me. There is a
pretty good store of stone accumulated. I had only another month to go
in any case. To tell you the truth, I had been looking forward to my
retirement. And perhaps, as Benjamin is growing old too, they will let
him retire at the same time and be a companion to me.“ I</p>
<p>X35</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>“We must get help at once,“ said Clover. “Run, somebody, and tell
Squealer what has happened.“ All the other animals immediately raced
back to the farmhouse to give Squealer the news. Only Clover remained,
and Benjamin7 who lay down at Boxer’s side, and, without speaking, kept
the flies off him with his long tail. After about a quarter of an hour
Squealer appeared, full of sympathy and concern. He said that Comrade
Napoleon had learned with the very deepest distress of this misfortune
to one of the most loyal workers on the farm, and was already making
arrangements to send Boxer to be treated in the hospital at Willingdon.
The animals felt a little uneasy at this. Except for Mollie and
Snowball, no other animal had ever left the farm, and they did not like
to think of their sick comrade in the hands of human beings. However,
Squealer easily convinced them that the veterinary surgeon in Willingdon
could treat Boxer’s case more satisfactorily than could be done on the
farm. And about half an hour later, when Boxer had somewhat recovered,
he was with difficulty got on to his feet, and managed to limp back to
his stall, where Clover and Benjamin had prepared a good bed of straw
for him.</p>
<p>For the next two days Boxer remained in his stall. The pigs had sent
out a large bottle of pink medicine which they had found in the medicine
chest in the bathroom, and Clover administered it to Boxer twice a day
after meals. In the evenings she lay in his stall and talked to him,
while Benjamin kept the flies off him. Boxer professed not to be sorry
for what had happened. If he made a good recovery, he might expect to
live another three years, and he looked forward to the peaceful days
that he would spend in the corner of the big pasture. It would be the
first time that he had had leisure to study and improve his mind. He
intended, he said, to devote the rest of his life to learning the
remaining twenty−two letters of the alphabet. However, Benjamin and
Clover could only be with Boxer after working hours, and it was in the
middle of the day when the van came to take him away. The animals were
all at work weeding turnips under the supervision of a pig, when they
were astonished to see Benjamin come galloping from the direction of the
farm buildings, braying at the top of his voice. It was the first time
that they had ever seen Benjamin excited−indeed, it was the first time
that anyone had ever seen him gallop. “Quick, quick!“ he shouted.</p>
<p>“Come at once! They’re taking Boxer away!“ Without waiting for orders
from the pig, the animals broke off work and raced back to the farm
buildings. Sure enough, there in the yard was a large closed van, drawn
by two horses, with lettering on its side and a sly−looking man in a
low−crowned bowler hat sitting on the driver’s seat. And Boxer’s stall
was empty.</p>
<p>The animals crowded round the van. “Good−bye, Boxer!“ they chorused,
“good−bye!“</p>
<p>“Fools! Fools!“ shouted Benjamin, prancing round them and stamping
the earth with his small hoofs. “Fools!</p>
<p>Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?“</p>
<p>That gave the animals pause, and there was a hush. Muriel began to
spell out the words. But Benjamin pushed her aside and in the midst of a
deadly silence he read:</p>
<p>“ ‘Alfred Simmonds, Horse Slaughterer and Glue Boiler, Willingdon.
Dealer in Hides and Bone−Meal. Kennels Supplied.’ Do you not understand
what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker’s! “ A cry of
horror burst from all the animals. At this moment the man on the box
whipped up his horses and the van moved out of the yard at a smart trot.
All the animals followed, crying out at the tops of their voices. Clover
forced her way to the front. The van began to gather speed. Clover tried
to stir her stout limbs to a gallop, and achieved a canter. “Boxer!“ she
cried. “Boxer! Boxer! Boxer!“ And just at this moment, as though he had
heard the uproar outside, Boxer’s face, with the white stripe down his
nose, appeared at the small window at the back of the van.</p>
