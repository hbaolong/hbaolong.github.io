<p>X36</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>“Boxer!“ cried Clover in a terrible voice. “Boxer! Get out! Get out
quickly! They’re taking you to your death!“</p>
<p>All the animals took up the cry of “Get out, Boxer, get out!“ But the
van was already gathering speed and drawing away from them. It was
uncertain whether Boxer had understood what Clover had said. But a
moment later his face disappeared from the window and there was the
sound of a tremendous drumming of hoofs inside the van. He was trying to
kick his way out. The time had been when a few kicks from Boxer’s hoofs
would have smashed the van to matchwood. But alas! his strength had left
him; and in a few moments the sound of drumming hoofs grew fainter and
died away. In desperation the animals began appealing to the two horses
which drew the van to stop. “Comrades, comrades!“ they shouted. “Don’t
take your own brother to his death! “ But the stupid brutes, too
ignorant to realise what was happening, merely set back their ears and
quickened their pace. Boxer’s face did not reappear at the window. Too
late, someone thought of racing ahead and shutting the five−barred gate;
but in another moment the van was through it and rapidly disappearing
down the road. Boxer was never seen again.</p>
<p>Three days later it was announced that he had died in the hospital at
Willingdon, in spite of receiving every attention a horse could have.
Squealer came to announce the news to the others. He had, he said, been
present during Boxer’s last hours.</p>
<p>“It was the most affecting sight I have ever seen!“ said Squealer,
lifting his trotter and wiping away a tear. “I was at his bedside at the
very last. And at the end, almost too weak to speak, he whispered in my
ear that his sole sorrow was to have passed on before the windmill was
finished. ‘Forward, comrades!’ he whispered.</p>
<p>‘Forward in the name of the Rebellion. Long live Animal Farm! Long
live Comrade Napoleon! Napoleon is always right.’ Those were his very
last words, comrades.“</p>
<p>Here Squealer’s demeanour suddenly changed. He fell silent for a
moment, and his little eyes darted suspicious glances from side to side
before he proceeded.</p>
<p>It had come to his knowledge, he said, that a foolish and wicked
rumour had been circulated at the time of Boxer’s removal. Some of the
animals had noticed that the van which took Boxer away was marked “Horse
Slaughterer,“ and had actually jumped to the conclusion that Boxer was
being sent to the knacker’s. It was almost unbelievable, said Squealer,
that any animal could be so stupid. Surely, he cried indignantly,
whisking his tail and skipping from side to side, surely they knew their
beloved Leader, Comrade Napoleon, better than that? But the explanation
was really very simple. The van had previously been the property of the
knacker, and had been bought by the veterinary surgeon, who had not yet
painted the old name out. That was how the mistake had arisen.</p>
<p>The animals were enormously relieved to hear this. And when Squealer
went on to give further graphic details of Boxer’s death−bed, the
admirable care he had received, and the expensive medicines for which
Napoleon had paid without a thought as to the cost, their last doubts
disappeared and the sorrow that they felt for their comrade’s death was
tempered by the thought that at least he had died happy. Napoleon
himself appeared at the meeting on the following Sunday morning and
pronounced a short oration in Boxer’s honour. It had not been possible,
he said, to bring back their lamented comrade’s remains for interment on
the farm, but he had ordered a large wreath to be made from the laurels
in the farmhouse garden and sent down to be placed on Boxer’s grave. And
in a few days’ time the pigs intended to hold a memorial banquet in
Boxer’s honour. Napoleon ended his speech with a reminder of Boxer’s two
favourite maxims, “I will work harder“ and “Comrade Napoleon is always
right“−maxims, he said, which every animal would do well to adopt as his
own.</p>
