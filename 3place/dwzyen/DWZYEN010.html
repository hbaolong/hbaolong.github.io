<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>And he moved off at his lumbering trot and made for the quarry.
Having got there, he collected two successive loads of stone and dragged
them down to the windmill before retiring for the night. The animals
huddled about Clover, not speaking. The knoll where they were lying gave
them a wide prospect across the countryside. Most of Animal Farm was
within their view−the long pasture stretching down to the main road, the
hayfield, the spinney, the drinking pool, the ploughed fields where the
young wheat was thick and green, and the red roofs of the farm buildings
with the smoke curling from the chimneys. It was a clear spring evening.
The grass and the bursting hedges were gilded by the level rays of the
sun. Never had the farm−and with a kind of surprise they remembered that
it was their own farm, every inch of it their own property−appeared to
the animals so desirable a place. As Clover looked down the hillside her
eyes filled with tears. If she could have spoken her thoughts, it would
have been to say that this was not what they had aimed at when they had
set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the human race.
These scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had looked
forward to on that night when old Major first stirred them to rebellion.
If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a
society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each
working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as
she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the
night of Major’s speech. Instead−she did not know why−they had come to a
time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed
everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after
confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or
disobedience in her mind. She knew that, even as things were, they were
far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before
all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings.
Whatever happened she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the
orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon.
But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had
hoped and toiled. It was not for this that they had built the windmill
and faced the bullets of Jones’s gun. Such were her thoughts, though she
lacked the words to express them. At last, feeling this to be in some
way a substitute for the words she was unable to find, she began to sing
Beasts of England . The other animals sitting round her took it up, and
they sang it three times over−very tunefully, but slowly and mournfully,
in a way they had never sung it before. They had just finished singing
it for the third time when Squealer, attended by two dogs, approached
them with the air of having something important to say. He announced
that, by a special decree of Comrade Napoleon, Beasts of England had
been abolished. From now onwards it was forbidden to sing it. The
animals were taken aback.</p>
<p>“Why?“ cried Muriel.</p>
<p>“It’s no longer needed, comrade,“ said Squealer stiffly. “ Beasts of
England was the song of the Rebellion. But the Rebellion is now
completed. The execution of the traitors this afternoon was the final
act. The enemy both external and internal has been defeated. In Beasts
of England we expressed our longing for a better society in days to
come. But that society has now been established. Clearly this song has
no longer any purpose.“</p>
<p>Frightened though they were, some of the animals might possibly have
protested, but at this moment the sheep set up their usual bleating of
“Four legs good, two legs bad,“ which went on for several minutes and
put an end to the discussion.</p>
<p>So Beasts of England was heard no more. In its place Minimus, the
poet, had composed another song which began:</p>
