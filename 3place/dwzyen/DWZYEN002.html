<h4 id="i">I</h4>
<p>MR. JONES, of the Manor Farm, had locked the hen−houses for the
night, but was too drunk to remember to shut the popholes. With the ring
of light from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across
the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last
glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to
bed, where Mrs. Jones was already snoring.</p>
<p>As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and
a fluttering all through the farm buildings. Word had gone round during
the day that old Major, the prize Middle White boar, had had a strange
dream on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other
animals. It had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as
soon as Mr. Jones was safely out of the way. Old Major (so he was always
called, though the name under which he had been exhibited was Willingdon
Beauty) was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready
to lose an hour’s sleep in order to hear what he had to say. At one end
of the big barn, on a sort of raised platform, Major was already
ensconced on his bed of straw, under a lantern which hung from a beam.
He was twelve years old and had lately grown rather stout, but he was
still a majestic−looking pig, with a wise and benevolent appearance in
spite of the fact that his tushes had never been cut. Before long the
other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable after
their different fashions. First came the three dogs, Bluebell, Jessie,
and Pincher, and then the pigs, who settled down in the straw
immediately in front of the platform. The hens perched themselves on the
window−sills, the pigeons fluttered up to the rafters, the sheep and
cows lay down behind the pigs and began to chew the cud. The two
cart−horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and
setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care lest there should be
some small animal concealed in the straw. Clover was a stout motherly
mare approaching middle life, who had never quite got her figure back
after her fourth foal. Boxer was an enormous beast, nearly eighteen
hands high, and as strong as any two ordinary horses put together. A
white stripe down his nose gave him a somewhat stupid appearance, and in
fact he was not of first−rate intelligence, but he was universally
respected for his steadiness of character and tremendous powers of work.
After the horses came Muriel, the white goat, and Benjamin, the donkey.
Benjamin was the oldest animal on the farm, and the worst tempered. He
seldom talked, and when he did, it was usually to make some cynical
remark−for instance, he would say that God had given him a tail to keep
the flies off, but that he would sooner have had no tail and no flies.
Alone among the animals on the farm he never laughed. If asked why, he
would say that he saw nothing to laugh at. Nevertheless, without openly
admitting it, he was devoted to Boxer; the two of them usually spent
their Sundays together in the small paddock beyond the orchard, Animal
Farm</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>grazing side by side and never speaking.</p>
<p>The two horses had just lain down when a brood of ducklings, which
had lost their mother, filed into the barn, cheeping feebly and
wandering from side to side to find some place where they would not be
trodden on. Clover made a sort of wall round them with her great
foreleg, and the ducklings nestled down inside it and promptly fell
asleep. At the last moment Mollie, the foolish, pretty white mare who
drew Mr. Jones’s trap, came mincing daintily in, chewing at a lump of
sugar. She took a place near the front and began flirting her white
mane, hoping to draw attention to the red ribbons it was plaited with.
Last of all came the cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest
place, and finally squeezed herself in between Boxer and Clover; there
she purred contentedly throughout Major’s speech without listening to a
word of what he was saying. All the animals were now present except
Moses, the tame raven, who slept on a perch behind the back door. When
Major saw that they had all made themselves comfortable and were waiting
attentively, he cleared his throat and began:</p>
<p>“Comrades, you have heard already about the strange dream that I had
last night. But I will come to the dream later. I have something else to
say first. I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many
months longer, and before I die, I feel it my duty to pass on to you
such wisdom as I have acquired. I have had a long life, I have had much
time for thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that
I understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now
living. It is about this that I wish to speak to you.</p>
<p>“Now, comrades, what is the nature of this life of ours? Let us face
it: our lives are miserable, laborious, and short. We are born, we are
given just so much food as will keep the breath in our bodies, and those
of us who are capable of it are forced to work to the last atom of our
strength; and the very instant that our usefulness has come to an end we
are slaughtered with hideous cruelty. No animal in England knows the
meaning of happiness or leisure after he is a year old. No animal in
England is free. The life of an animal is misery and slavery: that is
the plain truth.</p>
<p>“But is this simply part of the order of nature? Is it because this
land of ours is so poor that it cannot afford a decent life to those who
dwell upon it? No, comrades, a thousand times no! The soil of England is
fertile, its climate is good, it is capable of affording food in
abundance to an enormously greater number of animals than now inhabit
it. This single farm of ours would support a dozen horses, twenty cows,
hundreds of sheep−and all of them living in a comfort and a dignity that
are now almost beyond our imagining. Why then do we continue in this
miserable condition? Because nearly the whole of the produce of our
labour is stolen from us by human beings. There, comrades, is the answer
to all our problems. It is summed up in a single word−Man. Man is the
only real enemy we have. Remove Man from the scene, and the root cause
of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.</p>
<p>“Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does
not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough,
he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the
animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum
that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.
Our labour tills the soil, our dung fertilises it, and yet there is not
one of us that owns more than his bare skin. You cows that I see before
me, how many thousands of gallons of milk have you given during this
last year? And what has happened to that milk which should have been
breeding up sturdy calves? Every drop of it has gone down the throats of
our enemies. And you hens, how many eggs have you laid in this last
year, and how many of those eggs ever hatched into chickens? The rest
have all gone to market to bring in money for Jones and his men. And
you, Clover, where are those four foals you bore, who should have been
the support and pleasure of your old age? Each was sold at a year
old−you will never see one of them again. In return for your four
confinements and all your labour in the fields, what have you ever had
except your bare rations and a stall?</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>“And even the miserable lives we lead are not allowed to reach their
natural span. For myself I do not grumble, for I am one of the lucky
ones. I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children.
Such is the natural life of a pig. But no animal escapes the cruel knife
in the end. You young porkers who are sitting in front of me, every one
of you will scream your lives out at the block within a year. To that
horror we all must come−cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone. Even the
horses and the dogs have no better fate. You, Boxer, the very day that
those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to
the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the
foxhounds. As for the dogs, when they grow old and toothless, Jones ties
a brick round their necks and drowns them in the nearest pond.</p>
<p>“Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the evils of this
life of ours spring from the tyranny of human beings? Only get rid of
Man, and the produce of our labour would be our own. A1most overnight we
could become rich and free. What then must we do? Why, work night and
day, body and soul, for the overthrow of the human race! That is my
message to you, comrades: Rebellion! I do not know when that Rebellion
will come, it might be in a week or in a hundred years, but I know, as
surely as I see this straw beneath my feet, that sooner or later justice
will be done. Fix your eyes on that, comrades, throughout the short
remainder of your lives! And above all, pass on this message of mine to
those who come after you, so that future generations shall carry on the
struggle until it is victorious.</p>
<p>“And remember, comrades, your resolution must never falter. No
argument must lead you astray. Never listen when they tell you that Man
and the animals have a common interest, that the prosperity of the one
is the prosperity of the others. It is all lies. Man serves the
interests of no creature except himself. And among us animals let there
be perfect unity, perfect comradeship in the struggle. All men are
enemies. All animals are comrades.“</p>
<p>At this moment there was a tremendous uproar. While Major was
speaking four large rats had crept out of their holes and were sitting
on their hindquarters, listening to him. The dogs had suddenly caught
sight of them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the
rats saved their lives. Major raised his trotter for silence.</p>
<p>“Comrades,“ he said, “here is a point that must be settled. The wild
creatures, such as rats and rabbits−are they our friends or our enemies?
Let us put it to the vote. I propose this question to the meeting: Are
rats comrades?“</p>
<p>The vote was taken at once, and it was agreed by an overwhelming
majority that rats were comrades. There were only four dissentients, the
three dogs and the cat, who was afterwards discovered to have voted on
both sides. Major continued:</p>
<p>“I have little more to say. I merely repeat, remember always your
duty of enmity towards Man and all his ways. Whatever goes upon two legs
is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.
And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to
resemble him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his vices.
No animal must ever live in a house, or sleep in a bed, or wear clothes,
or drink alcohol, or smoke tobacco, or touch money, or engage in trade.
All the habits of Man are evil. And, above all, no animal must ever
tyrannise over his own kind. Weak or strong, clever or simple, we are
all brothers. No animal must ever kill any other animal. All animals are
equal.</p>
<p>“And now, comrades, I will tell you about my dream of last night. I
cannot describe that dream to you. It was a dream of the earth as it
will be when Man has vanished. But it reminded me of something that I
had long forgotten. Many years ago, when I was a little pig, my mother
and the other sows used to sing an old song of which they knew only the
tune and the first three words. I had known that tune in my infancy, but
it had long since passed out of my mind. Last night, however, it came
back to me in my dream. And what is more, the words of the song also
came back−words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals of long
ago and have Animal Farm</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>been lost to memory for generations. I will sing you that song now,
comrades. I am old and my voice is hoarse, but when I have taught you
the tune, you can sing it better for yourselves. It is called Beasts of
England.“</p>
<p>Old Major cleared his throat and began to sing. As he had said, his
voice was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune,
something between Clementine and La Cucaracha. The words ran: Beasts of
England, beasts of Ireland,</p>
<p>Beasts of every land and clime,</p>
<p>Hearken to my joyful tidings</p>
<p>Of the golden future time.</p>
<p>Soon or late the day is coming,</p>
<p>Tyrant Man shall be o’erthrown,</p>
<p>And the fruitful fields of England</p>
<p>Shall be trod by beasts alone.</p>
<p>Rings shall vanish from our noses,</p>
<p>And the harness from our back,</p>
<p>Bit and spur shall rust forever,</p>
<p>Cruel whips no more shall crack.</p>
<p>Riches more than mind can picture,</p>
<p>Wheat and barley, oats and hay,</p>
<p>Clover, beans, and mangel−wurzels</p>
<p>Shall be ours upon that day.</p>
<p>Bright will shine the fields of England,</p>
<p>Purer shall its waters be,</p>
<p>Sweeter yet shall blow its breezes</p>
<p>On the day that sets us free.</p>
<p>For that day we all must labour,</p>
<p>Though we die before it break;</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>Cows and horses, geese and turkeys,</p>
<p>All must toil for freedom’s sake.</p>
<p>Beasts of England, beasts of Ireland,</p>
<p>Beasts of every land and clime,</p>
<p>Hearken well and spread my tidings</p>
<p>Of the golden future time.</p>
<p>The singing of this song threw the animals into the wildest
excitement. Almost before Major had reached the end, they had begun
singing it for themselves. Even the stupidest of them had already picked
up the tune and a few of the words, and as for the clever ones, such as
the pigs and dogs, they had the entire song by heart within a few
minutes. And then, after a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst
out into Beasts of England in tremendous unison. The cows lowed it, the
dogs whined it, the sheep bleated it, the horses whinnied it, the ducks
quacked it. They were so delighted with the song that they sang it right
through five times in succession, and might have continued singing it
all night if they had not been interrupted. Unfortunately, the uproar
awoke Mr. Jones, who sprang out of bed, making sure that there was a fox
in the yard. He seized the gun which always stood in a corner of his
bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot into the darkness. The
pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn and the meeting broke
up hurriedly. Everyone fled to his own sleeping−place. The birds jumped
on to their perches, the animals settled down in the straw, and the
whole farm was asleep in a moment.</p>
