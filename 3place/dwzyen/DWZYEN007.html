<h4 id="vii">VII</h4>
<p>IT WAS a bitter winter. The stormy weather was followed by sleet and
snow, and then by a hard frost which did not break till well into
February. The animals carried on as best they could with the rebuilding
of the windmill, well knowing that the outside world was watching them
and that the envious human beings would rejoice and triumph if the mill
were not finished on time.</p>
<p>Out of spite, the human beings pretended not to believe that it was
Snowball who had destroyer the windmill: they said that it had fallen
down because the walls were too thin. The animals knew that this was not
the case. Still, it had been decided to build the walls three feet thick
this time instead of eighteen inches as before, which meant collecting
much larger quantities of stone. For a long i.ne the quarry was full of
snowdrifts and nothing could be done. Some progress was made in the dry
frosty weather that followed, but it was cruel work, and the animals
could not feel so hopeful about it as they had felt before. They were
always cold, and usually hungry as well. Only Boxer and Clover never
lost heart. Squealer made excellent speeches on the joy of service and
the dignity of labour, but the other animals found more inspiration in
Boxer’s strength and his never−failing cry of “I will work harder! “</p>
<p>In January food fell short. The corn ration was drastically reduced,
and it was announced that an extra potato ration would be issued to make
up for it. Then it was discovered that the greater part of the potato
crop had been frosted in the clamps, which had not been covered thickly
enough. The potatoes had become soft and discoloured, and only a few
were edible. For days at a time the animals had nothing to eat but chaff
and mangels. Starvation seemed to stare them in the face.</p>
<p>It was vitally necessary to conceal this fact from the outside world.
Emboldened by the collapse of the windmill, the human beings were
inventing fresh lies about Animal Farm. Once again it was being put
about that all the animals were dying of famine and disease, and that
they were continually fighting among themselves and had resorted to
cannibalism and infanticide. Napoleon was well aware of the bad results
that might follow if the real facts of the food situation were known,
and he decided to make use of Mr. Whymper to spread a contrary
impression. Hitherto the animals had had little or no contact with
Whymper on his weekly visits: now, however, a few selected animals,
mostly sheep, were instructed to remark casually in his hearing that
rations had been increased. In addition, Napoleon ordered the almost
empty bins in the store−shed to be filled nearly to the brim with sand,
which was then covered up with what remained of the grain and meal. On
some suitable pretext Whymper was led through the store−shed and allowed
to catch a glimpse of the bins. He was deceived, and continued to report
to the outside world that there was no food shortage on Animal Farm.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, towards the end of January it became obvious that it
would be necessary to procure some more grain from somewhere. In these
days Napoleon rarely appeared in public, but spent all his time in the
farmhouse, which was guarded at each door by fierce−looking dogs. When
he did emerge, it was in a ceremonial manner, with an escort of six dogs
who closely surrounded him and growled if anyone came too near.
Frequently he did not even appear on Sunday mornings, but issued his
orders through one of the other pigs, usually Squealer.</p>
<p>One Sunday morning Squealer announced that the hens, who had just
come in to lay again, must surrender their eggs. Napoleon had accepted,
through Whymper, a contract for four hundred eggs a week. The price of
these would pay for enough grain and meal to keep the farm going till
summer came on and conditions were easier.</p>
