<p>X40</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>At the gate they paused, half frightened to go on but Clover led the
way in. They tiptoed up to the house, and such animals as were tall
enough peered in at the dining−room window. There, round the long table,
sat half a dozen farmers and half a dozen of the more eminent pigs,
Napoleon himself occupying the seat of honour at the head of the table.
The pigs appeared completely at ease in their chairs The company had
been enjoying a game of cards but had broken off for the moment,
evidently in order to drink a toast. A large jug was circulating, and
the mugs were being refilled with beer. No one noticed the wondering
faces of the animals that gazed in at the window.</p>
<p>Mr. Pilkington, of Foxwood, had stood up, his mug in his hand. In a
moment, he said, he would ask the present company to drink a toast. But
before doing so, there were a few words that he felt it incumbent upon
him to say.</p>
<p>It was a source of great satisfaction to him, he said−and, he was
sure, to all others present−to feel that a long period of mistrust and
misunderstanding had now come to an end. There had been a time−not that
he, or any of the present company, had shared such sentiments−but there
had been a time when the respected proprietors of Animal Farm had been
regarded, he would not say with hostility, but perhaps with a certain
measure of misgiving, by their human neighbours. Unfortunate incidents
had occurred, mistaken ideas had been current. It had been felt that the
existence of a farm owned and operated by pigs was somehow abnormal and
was liable to have an unsettling effect in the neighbourhood. Too many
farmers had assumed, without due enquiry, that on such a farm a spirit
of licence and indiscipline would prevail. They had been nervous about
the effects upon their own animals, or even upon their human employees.
But all such doubts were now dispelled. Today he and his friends had
visited Animal Farm and inspected every inch of it with their own eyes,
and what did they find? Not only the most up−to−date methods, but a
discipline and an orderliness which should be an example to all farmers
everywhere. He believed that he was right in saying that the lower
animals on Animal Farm did more work and received less food than any
animals in the county. Indeed, he and his fellow−visitors today had
observed many features which they intended to introduce on their own
farms immediately.</p>
<p>He would end his remarks, he said, by emphasising once again the
friendly feelings that subsisted, and ought to subsist, between Animal
Farm and its neighbours. Between pigs and human beings there was not,
and there need not be, any clash of interests whatever. Their struggles
and their difficulties were one. Was not the labour problem the same
everywhere? Here it became apparent that Mr. Pilkington was about to
spring some carefully prepared witticism on the company, but for a
moment he was too overcome by amusement to be able to utter it. After
much choking, during which his various chins turned purple, he managed
to get it out:</p>
<p>“If you have your lower animals to contend with,“ he said, “we have
our lower classes!“ This bon mot set the table in a roar; and
Mr. Pilkington once again congratulated the pigs on the low rations, the
long working hours, and the general absence of pampering which he had
observed on Animal Farm. And now, he said finally, he would ask the
company to rise to their feet and make certain that their glasses were
full. “Gentlemen,“ concluded Mr. Pilkington, “gentlemen, I give you a
toast: To the prosperity of Animal Farm!“</p>
<p>There was enthusiastic cheering and stamping of feet. Napoleon was so
gratified that he left his place and came round the table to clink his
mug against Mr. Pilkington’s before emptying it. When the cheering had
died down, Napoleon, who had remained on his feet, intimated that he too
had a few words to say. Like all of Napoleon’s speeches, it was short
and to the point. He too, he said, was happy that the period of
misunderstanding was at an end. For a long time there had been
rumours−circulated, he had reason to think, by some malignant enemy−that
there was something subversive and even revolutionary in the outlook of
himself and his colleagues. They had been credited with attempting to
stir up rebellion among the animals on neighbouring farms. Nothing could
be further from the truth! Their sole wish, now and in the past, was to
live</p>
<p>X41</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>at peace and in normal business relations with their neighbours. This
farm which he had the honour to control, he added, was a co−operative
enterprise. The title−deeds, which were in his own possession, were
owned by the pigs jointly.</p>
<p>He did not believe, he said, that any of the old suspicions still
lingered, but certain changes had been made recently in the routine of
the farm which should have the effect of promoting confidence stiff
further. Hitherto the animals on the farm had had a rather foolish
custom of addressing one another as “Comrade.“ This was to be
suppressed. There had also been a very strange custom, whose origin was
unknown, of marching every Sunday morning past a boar’s skull which was
nailed to a post in the garden. This, too, would be suppressed, and the
skull had already been buried. His visitors might have observed, too,
the green flag which flew from the masthead. If so, they would perhaps
have noted that the white hoof and horn with which it had previously
been marked had now been removed. It would be a plain green flag from
now onwards. He had only one criticism, he said, to make of
Mr. Pilkington’s excellent and neighbourly speech. Mr. Pilkington had
referred throughout to “Animal Farm.“ He could not of course know−for
he, Napoleon, was only now for the first time announcing it−that the
name “Animal Farm“ had been abolished. Henceforward the farm was to be
known as “The Manor Farm“−which, he believed, was its correct and
original name.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,“ concluded Napoleon, “I will give you the same toast as
before, but in a different form. Fill your glasses to the brim.
Gentlemen, here is my toast: To the prosperity of The Manor Farm! “
There was the same hearty cheering as before, and the mugs were emptied
to the dregs. But as the animals outside gazed at the scene, it seemed
to them that some strange thing was happening. What was it that had
altered in the faces of the pigs? Clover’s old dim eyes flitted from one
face to another. Some of them had five chins, some had four, some had
three. But what was it that seemed to be melting and changing? Then, the
applause having come to an end, the company took up their cards and
continued the game that had been interrupted, and the animals crept
silently away.</p>
<p>But they had not gone twenty yards when they stopped short. An uproar
of voices was coming from the farmhouse. They rushed back and looked
through the window again. Yes, a violent quarrel was in progress. There
were shoutings, bangings on the table, sharp suspicious glances, furious
denials. The source of the trouble appeared to be that Napoleon and
Mr. Pilkington had each played an ace of spades simultaneously. Twelve
voices were shouting in anger, and they were all alike. No question,
now, what had happened to the faces of the pigs. The creatures outside
looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again;
but already it was impossible to say which was which.</p>
