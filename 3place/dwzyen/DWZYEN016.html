<p>X37</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>On the day appointed for the banquet, a grocer’s van drove up from
Willingdon and delivered a large wooden crate at the farmhouse. That
night there was the sound of uproarious singing, which was followed by
what sounded like a violent quarrel and ended at about eleven o’clock
with a tremendous crash of glass. No one stirred in the farmhouse before
noon on the following day, and the word went round that from somewhere
or other the pigs had acquired the money to buy themselves another case
of whisky.</p>
<p>XYEARS passed. The seasons came and went, the short animal lives fled
by. A time came when there was no one who remembered the old days before
the Rebellion, except Clover, Benjamin, Moses the raven, and a number of
the pigs.</p>
<p>Muriel was dead; Bluebell, Jessie, and Pincher were dead. Jones too
was dead−he had died in an inebriates’</p>
<p>home in another part of the country. Snowball was forgotten. Boxer
was forgotten, except by the few who had known him. Clover was an old
stout mare now, stiff in the joints and with a tendency to rheumy eyes.
She was two years past the retiring age, but in fact no animal had ever
actually retired. The talk of setting aside a corner of the pasture for
superannuated animals had long since been dropped. Napoleon was now a
mature boar of twenty−four stone. Squealer was so fat that he could with
difficulty see out of his eyes. Only old Benjamin was much the same as
ever, except for being a little greyer about the muzzle, and, since
Boxer’s death, more morose and taciturn than ever.</p>
<p>There were many more creatures on the farm now, though the increase
was not so great as had been expected in earlier years. Many animals had
been born to whom the Rebellion was only a dim tradition, passed on by
word of mouth, and others had been bought who had never heard mention of
such a thing before their arrival. The farm possessed three horses now
besides Clover. They were fine upstanding beasts, willing workers and
good comrades, but very stupid. None of them proved able to learn the
alphabet beyond the letter B. They accepted everything that they were
told about the Rebellion and the principles of Animalism, especially
from Clover, for whom they had an almost filial respect; but it was
doubtful whether they understood very much of it.</p>
<p>The farm was more prosperous now, and better organised: it had even
been enlarged by two fields which had been bought from Mr. Pilkington.
The windmill had been successfully completed at last, and the farm
possessed a threshing machine and a hay elevator of its own, and various
new buildings had been added to it. Whymper had bought himself a
dogcart. The windmill, however, had not after all been used for
generating electrical power. It was used for milling corn, and brought
in a handsome money profit. The animals were hard at work building yet
another windmill; when that one was finished, so it was said, the
dynamos would be installed. But the luxuries of which Snowball had once
taught the animals to dream, the stalls with electric light and hot and
cold water, and the three−day week, were no longer talked about.
Napoleon had denounced such ideas as contrary to the spirit of
Animalism. The truest happiness, he said, lay in working hard and living
frugally.</p>
<p>Somehow it seemed as though the farm had grown richer without making
the animals themselves any richer−except, of course, for the pigs and
the dogs. Perhaps this was partly because there were so many pigs and so
many dogs. It was not that these creatures did not work, after their
fashion. There was, as Squealer was never tired of explaining, endless
work in the supervision and organisation of the farm. Much of this work
was of a kind that the other animals were too ignorant to understand.
For example, Squealer told them that the pigs had to expend enormous
labours every day upon mysterious things called “files,“ “reports,“</p>
<p>“minutes,“ and “memoranda.“ These were large sheets of paper which
had to be closely covered with writing, and as soon as they were so
covered, they were burnt in the furnace. This was of the highest
importance for the welfare of the farm, Squealer said. But still,
neither pigs nor dogs produced any food by their own labour;</p>
<p>X38</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>and there were very many of them, and their appetites were always
good. As for the others, their life, so far as they knew, was as it had
always been. They were generally hungry, they slept on straw, they drank
from the pool, they laboured in the fields; in winter they were troubled
by the cold, and in summer by the flies. Sometimes the older ones among
them racked their dim memories and tried to determine whether in the
early days of the Rebellion, when Jones’s expulsion was still recent,
things had been better or worse than now. They could not remember. There
was nothing with which they could compare their present lives: they had
nothing to go upon except Squealer’s lists of figures, which invariably
demonstrated that everything was getting better and better. The animals
found the problem insoluble; in any case, they had little time for
speculating on such things now. Only old Benjamin professed to remember
every detail of his long life and to know that things never had been,
nor ever could be much better or much worse−hunger, hardship, and
disappointment being, so he said, the unalterable law of life. And yet
the animals never gave up hope. More, they never lost, even for an
instant, their sense of honour and privilege in being members of Animal
Farm. They were still the only farm in the whole county−in all
England!−owned and operated by animals. Not one of them, not even the
youngest, not even the newcomers who had been brought from farms ten or
twenty miles away, ever ceased to marvel at that. And when they heard
the gun booming and saw the green flag fluttering at the masthead, their
hearts swelled with imperishable pride, and the talk turned always
towards the old heroic days, the expulsion of Jones, the writing of the
Seven Commandments, the great battles in which the human invaders had
been defeated. None of the old dreams had been abandoned. The Republic
of the Animals which Major had foretold, when the green fields of
England should be untrodden by human feet, was still believed in. Some
day it was coming: it might not be soon, it might not be with in the
lifetime of any animal now living, but still it was coming. Even the
tune of Beasts of England was perhaps hummed secretly here and there: at
any rate, it was a fact that every animal on the farm knew it, though no
one would have dared to sing it aloud. It might be that their lives were
hard and that not all of their hopes had been fulfilled; but they were
conscious that they were not as other animals. If they went hungry, it
was not from feeding tyrannical human beings; if they worked hard, at
least they worked for themselves. No creature among them went upon two
legs. No creature called any other creature “Master.“ All animals were
equal.</p>
<p>One day in early summer Squealer ordered the sheep to follow him, and
led them out to a piece of waste ground at the other end of the farm,
which had become overgrown with birch saplings. The sheep spent the
whole day there browsing at the leaves under Squealer’s supervision. In
the evening he returned to the farmhouse himself, but, as it was warm
weather, told the sheep to stay where they were. It ended by their
remaining there for a whole week, during which time the other animals
saw nothing of them. Squealer was with them for the greater part of
every day. He was, he said, teaching them to sing a new song, for which
privacy was needed.</p>
<p>It was just after the sheep had returned, on a pleasant evening when
the animals had finished work and were making their way back to the farm
buildings, that the terrified neighing of a horse sounded from the yard.
Startled, the animals stopped in their tracks. It was Clover’s voice.
She neighed again, and all the animals broke into a gallop and rushed
into the yard. Then they saw what Clover had seen. It was a pig walking
on his hind legs.</p>
<p>Yes, it was Squealer. A little awkwardly, as though not quite used to
supporting his considerable bulk in that position, but with perfect
balance, he was strolling across the yard. And a moment later, out from
the door of the farmhouse came a long file of pigs, all walking on their
hind legs. Some did it better than others, one or two were even a trifle
unsteady and looked as though they would have liked the support of a
stick, but every one of them made his way right round the yard
successfully. And finally there was a tremendous baying of dogs and a
shrill crowing from the black cockerel, and out came Napoleon himself,
majestically upright,</p>
<p>X39</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>casting haughty glances from side to side, and with his dogs
gambolling round him. He carried a whip in his trotter.</p>
<p>There was a deadly silence. Amazed, terrified, huddling together, the
animals watched the long line of pigs march slowly round the yard. It
was as though the world had turned upside−down. Then there came a moment
when the first shock had worn off and when, in spite of everything−in
spite of their terror of the dogs, and of the habit, developed through
long years, of never complaining, never criticising, no matter what
happened−they might have uttered some word of protest. But just at that
moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous
bleating of−</p>
<p>“Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!
Four legs good, two legs better!“ It went on for five minutes without
stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to
utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the
farmhouse. Benjamin felt a nose nuzzling at his shoulder. He looked
round. It was Clover. Her old eyes looked dimmer than ever. Without
saying anything, she tugged gently at his mane and led him round to the
end of the big barn, where the Seven Commandments were written. For a
minute or two they stood gazing at the tatted wall with its white
lettering.</p>
<p>“My sight is failing,“ she said finally. “Even when I was young I
could not have read what was written there. But it appears to me that
that wall looks different. Are the Seven Commandments the same as they
used to be, Benjamin?“</p>
<p>For once Benjamin consented to break his rule, and he read out to her
what was written on the wall. There was nothing there now except a
single Commandment. It ran:</p>
<p>ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL</p>
<p>BUT SOME ANIMALS ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS</p>
<p>After that it did not seem strange when next day the pigs who were
supervising the work of the farm all carried whips in their trotters. It
did not seem strange to learn that the pigs had bought themselves a
wireless set, were arranging to install a telephone, and had taken out
subscriptions to John Bull, TitBits, and the Daily Mirror. It did not
seem strange when Napoleon was seen strolling in the farmhouse garden
with a pipe in his mouth−no, not even when the pigs took Mr. Jones’s
clothes out of the wardrobes and put them on, Napoleon himself appearing
in a black coat, ratcatcher breeches, and leather leggings, while his
favourite sow appeared in the watered silk dress which Mrs. Jones had
been used to wear on Sundays. A week later, in the afternoon, a number
of dogcarts drove up to the farm. A deputation of neighbouring farmers
had been invited to make a tour of inspection. They were shown all over
the farm, and expressed great admiration for everything they saw,
especially the windmill. The animals were weeding the turnip field. They
worked diligently hardly raising their faces from the ground, and not
knowing whether to be more frightened of the pigs or of the human
visitors.</p>
<p>That evening loud laughter and bursts of singing came from the
farmhouse. And suddenly, at the sound of the mingled voices, the animals
were stricken with curiosity. What could be happening in there, now that
for the first time animals and human beings were meeting on terms of
equality? With one accord they began to creep as quietly as possible
into the farmhouse garden.</p>
