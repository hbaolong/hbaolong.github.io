<p>22</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>When the hens heard this, they raised a terrible outcry. They had
been warned earlier that this sacrifice might be necessary, but had not
believed that it would really happen. They were just getting their
clutches ready for the spring sitting, and they protested that to take
the eggs away now was murder. For the first time since the expulsion of
Jones, there was something resembling a rebellion. Led by three young
Black Minorca pullets, the hens made a determined effort to thwart
Napoleon’s wishes. Their method was to fly up to the rafters and there
lay their eggs, which smashed to pieces on the floor. Napoleon acted
swiftly and ruthlessly. He ordered the hens’ rations to be stopped, and
decreed that any animal giving so much as a grain of corn to a hen
should be punished by death. The dogs saw to it that these orders were
carried out. For five days the hens held out, then they capitulated and
went back to their nesting boxes. Nine hens had died in the meantime.
Their bodies were buried in the orchard, and it was given out that they
had died of coccidiosis. Whymper heard nothing of this affair, and the
eggs were duly delivered, a grocer’s van driving up to the farm once a
week to take them away.</p>
<p>All this while no more had been seen of Snowball. He was rumoured to
be hiding on one of the neighbouring farms, either Foxwood or
Pinchfield. Napoleon was by this time on slightly better terms with the
other farmers than before. It happened that there was in the yard a pile
of timber which had been stacked there ten years earlier when a beech
spinney was cleared. It was well seasoned, and Whymper had advised
Napoleon to sell it; both Mr. Pilkington and Mr. Frederick were anxious
to buy it. Napoleon was hesitating between the two, unable to make up
his mind. It was noticed that whenever he seemed on the point of coming
to an agreement with Frederick, Snowball was declared to be in hiding at
Foxwood, while, when he inclined toward Pilkington, Snowball was said to
be at Pinchfield.</p>
<p>Suddenly, early in the spring, an alarming thing was discovered.
Snowball was secretly frequenting the farm by night! The animals were so
disturbed that they could hardly sleep in their stalls. Every night, it
was said, he came creeping in under cover of darkness and performed all
kinds of mischief. He stole the corn, he upset the milk−pails, he broke
the eggs, he trampled the seedbeds, he gnawed the bark off the fruit
trees. Whenever anything went wrong it became usual to attribute it to
Snowball. If a window was broken or a drain was blocked up, someone was
certain to say that Snowball had come in the night and done it, and when
the key of the store−shed was lost, the whole farm was convinced that
Snowball had thrown it down the well. Curiously enough, they went on
believing this even after the mislaid key was found under a sack of
meal. The cows declared unanimously that Snowball crept into their
stalls and milked them in their sleep. The rats, which had been
troublesome that winter, were also said to be in league with Snowball.
Napoleon decreed that there should be a full investigation into
Snowball’s activities. With his dogs in attendance he set out and made a
careful tour of inspection of the farm buildings, the other animals
following at a respectful distance. At every few steps Napoleon stopped
and snuffed the ground for traces of Snowball’s footsteps, which, he
said, he could detect by the smell. He snuffed in every corner, in the
barn, in the cow−shed, in the henhouses, in the vegetable garden, and
found traces of Snowball almost everywhere. He would put his snout to
the ground, give several deep sniffs, ad exclaim in a terrible voice,
“Snowball! He has been here! I can smell him distinctly!“ and at the
word “Snowball“ all the dogs let out blood−curdling growls and showed
their side teeth.</p>
<p>The animals were thoroughly frightened. It seemed to them as though
Snowball were some kind of invisible influence, pervading the air about
them and menacing them with all kinds of dangers. In the evening
Squealer called them together, and with an alarmed expression on his
face told them that he had some serious news to report.</p>
<p>“Comrades!“ cried Squealer, making little nervous skips, “a most
terrible thing has been discovered. Snowball has sold himself to
Frederick of Pinchfield Farm, who is even now plotting to attack us and
take our farm away from us! Snowball is to act as his guide when the
attack begins. But there is worse than that. We had thought that
Snowball’s rebellion was caused simply by his vanity and ambition. But
we were wrong, VII</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>comrades. Do you know what the real reason was? Snowball was in
league with Jones from the very start! He was Jones’s secret agent all
the time. It has all been proved by documents which he left behind him
and which we have only just discovered. To my mind this explains a great
deal, comrades. Did we not see for ourselves how he
attempted−fortunately without success−to get us defeated and destroyed
at the Battle of the Cowshed?“</p>
<p>The animals were stupefied. This was a wickedness far outdoing
Snowball’s destruction of the windmill. But it was some minutes before
they could fully take it in. They all remembered, or thought they
remembered, how they had seen Snowball charging ahead of them at the
Battle of the Cowshed, how he had rallied and encouraged them at every
turn, and how he had not paused for an instant even when the pellets
from Jones’s gun had wounded his back. At first it was a little
difficult to see how this fitted in with his being on Jones’s side. Even
Boxer, who seldom asked questions, was puzzled. He lay down, tucked his
fore hoofs beneath him, shut his eyes, and with a hard effort managed to
formulate his thoughts.</p>
<p>“I do not believe that,“ he said. “Snowball fought bravely at the
Battle of the Cowshed. I saw him myself. Did we not give him ‘Animal
Hero, first Class,’ immediately afterwards?“</p>
<p>“That was our mistake, comrade. For we know now−it is all written
down in the secret documents that we have found−that in reality he was
trying to lure us to our doom.“</p>
<p>“But he was wounded,“ said Boxer. “We all saw him running with
blood.“</p>
<p>“That was part of the arrangement!“ cried Squealer. “Jones’s shot
only grazed him. I could show you this in his own writing, if you were
able to read it. The plot was for Snowball, at the critical moment, to
give the signal for flight and leave the field to the enemy. And he very
nearly succeeded−I will even say, comrades, he would have succeeded if
it had not been for our heroic Leader, Comrade Napoleon. Do you not
remember how, just at the moment when Jones and his men had got inside
the yard, Snowball suddenly turned and fled, and many animals followed
him? And do you not remember, too, that it was just at that moment, when
panic was spreading and all seemed lost, that Comrade Napoleon sprang
forward with a cry of ‘Death to Humanity!’</p>
<p>and sank his teeth in Jones’s leg? Surely you remember that,
comrades?“ exclaimed Squealer, frisking from side to side.</p>
<p>Now when Squealer described the scene so graphically, it seemed to
the animals that they did remember it. At any rate, they remembered that
at the critical moment of the battle Snowball had turned to flee. But
Boxer was still a little uneasy.</p>
<p>“I do not believe that Snowball was a traitor at the beginning,“ he
said finally. “What he has done since is different. But I believe that
at the Battle of the Cowshed he was a good comrade.“</p>
<p>“Our Leader, Comrade Napoleon,“ announced Squealer, speaking very
slowly and firmly, “has stated categorically−categorically, comrade−that
Snowball was Jones’s agent from the very beginning−yes, and from long
before the Rebellion was ever thought of.“</p>
<p>“Ah, that is different!“ said Boxer. “If Comrade Napoleon says it, it
must be right.“</p>
<p>“That is the true spirit, comrade!“ cried Squealer, but it was
noticed he cast a very ugly look at Boxer with his little twinkling
eyes. He turned to go, then paused and added impressively: “I warn every
animal on this farm to keep his eyes very wide open. For we have reason
to think that some of Snowball’s secret agents are lurking among us at
this moment! “</p>
