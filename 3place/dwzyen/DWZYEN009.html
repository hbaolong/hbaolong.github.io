<p>24</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>Four days later, in the late afternoon, Napoleon ordered all the
animals to assemble in the yard. When they were all gathered together,
Napoleon emerged from the farmhouse, wearing both his medals (for he had
recently awarded himself “Animal Hero, First Class,“ and “Animal Hero,
Second Class“), with his nine huge dogs frisking round him and uttering
growls that sent shivers down all the animals’ spines. They all cowered
silently in their places, seeming to know in advance that some terrible
thing was about to happen. Napoleon stood sternly surveying his
audience; then he uttered a high−pitched whimper. Immediately the dogs
bounded forward, seized four of the pigs by the ear and dragged them,
squealing with pain and terror, to Napoleon’s feet. The pigs’ ears were
bleeding, the dogs had tasted blood, and for a few moments they appeared
to go quite mad. To the amazement of everybody, three of them flung
themselves upon Boxer. Boxer saw them coming and put out his great hoof,
caught a dog in mid−air, and pinned him to the ground. The dog shrieked
for mercy and the other two fled with their tails between their legs.
Boxer looked at Napoleon to know whether he should crush the dog to
death or let it go. Napoleon appeared to change countenance, and sharply
ordered Boxer to let the dog go, whereat Boxer lifted his hoof, and the
dog slunk away, bruised and howling.</p>
<p>Presently the tumult died down. The four pigs waited, trembling, with
guilt written on every line of their countenances. Napoleon now called
upon them to confess their crimes. They were the same four pigs as had
protested when Napoleon abolished the Sunday Meetings. Without any
further prompting they confessed that they had been secretly in touch
with Snowball ever since his expulsion, that they had collaborated with
him in destroying the windmill, and that they had entered into an
agreement with him to hand over Animal Farm to Mr. Frederick. They added
that Snowball had privately admitted to them that he had been Jones’s
secret agent for years past. When they had finished their confession,
the dogs promptly tore their throats out, and in a terrible voice
Napoleon demanded whether any other animal had anything to confess. The
three hens who had been the ringleaders in the attempted rebellion over
the eggs now came forward and stated that Snowball had appeared to them
in a dream and incited them to disobey Napoleon’s orders. They, too,
were slaughtered. Then a goose came forward and confessed to having
secreted six ears of corn during the last year’s harvest and eaten them
in the night. Then a sheep confessed to having urinated in the drinking
pool−urged to do this, so she said, by Snowball−and two other sheep
confessed to having murdered an old ram, an especially devoted follower
of Napoleon, by chasing him round and round a bonfire when he was
suffering from a cough. They were all slain on the spot. And so the tale
of confessions and executions went on, until there was a pile of corpses
lying before Napoleon’s feet and the air was heavy with the smell of
blood, which had been unknown there since the expulsion of Jones.</p>
<p>When it was all over, the remaining animals, except for the pigs and
dogs, crept away in a body. They were shaken and miserable. They did not
know which was more shocking−the treachery of the animals who had
leagued themselves with Snowball, or the cruel retribution they had just
witnessed. In the old days there had often been scenes of bloodshed
equally terrible, but it seemed to all of them that it was far worse now
that it was happening among themselves. Since Jones had left the farm,
until today, no animal had killed another animal. Not even a rat had
been killed. They had made their way on to the little knoll where the
half−finished windmill stood, and with one accord they all lay down as
though huddling together for warmth−Clover, Muriel, Benjamin, the cows,
the sheep, and a whole flock of geese and hens−everyone, indeed, except
the cat, who had suddenly disappeared just before Napoleon ordered the
animals to assemble. For some time nobody spoke. Only Boxer remained on
his feet. He fidgeted to and fro, swishing his long black tail against
his sides and occasionally uttering a little whinny of surprise. Finally
he said:</p>
<p>“I do not understand it. I would not have believed that such things
could happen on our farm. It must be due to some fault in ourselves. The
solution, as I see it, is to work harder. From now onwards I shall get
up a full hour earlier in the mornings.“</p>
