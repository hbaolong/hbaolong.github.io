<h4 id="viii">VIII</h4>
<p>31</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>“What victory?“ said Boxer. His knees were bleeding, he had lost a
shoe and split his hoof, and a dozen pellets had lodged themselves in
his hind leg.</p>
<p>“What victory, comrade? Have we not driven the enemy off our soil−the
sacred soil of Animal Farm? “</p>
<p>“But they have destroyed the windmill. And we had worked on it for
two years!“</p>
<p>“What matter? We will build another windmill. We will build six
windmills if we feel like it. You do not appreciate, comrade, the mighty
thing that we have done. The enemy was in occupation of this very ground
that we stand upon. And now−thanks to the leadership of Comrade
Napoleon−we have won every inch of it back again!“</p>
<p>“Then we have won back what we had before,“ said Boxer.</p>
<p>“That is our victory,“ said Squealer.</p>
<p>They limped into the yard. The pellets under the skin of Boxer’s leg
smarted painfully. He saw ahead of him the heavy labour of rebuilding
the windmill from the foundations, and already in imagination he braced
himself for the task. But for the first time it occurred to him that he
was eleven years old and that perhaps his great muscles were not quite
what they had once been.</p>
<p>But when the animals saw the green flag flying, and heard the gun
firing again−seven times it was fired in all−and heard the speech that
Napoleon made, congratulating them on their conduct, it did seem to them
after all that they had won a great victory. The animals slain in the
battle were given a solemn funeral. Boxer and Clover pulled the wagon
which served as a hearse, and Napoleon himself walked at the head of the
procession. Two whole days were given over to celebrations. There were
songs, speeches, and more firing of the gun, and a special gift of an
apple was bestowed on every animal, with two ounces of corn for each
bird and three biscuits for each dog. It was announced that the battle
would be called the Battle of the Windmill, and that Napoleon had
created a new decoration, the Order of the Green Banner, which he had
conferred upon himself. In the general rejoicings the unfortunate affair
of the banknotes was forgotten. It was a few days later than this that
the pigs came upon a case of whisky in the cellars of the farmhouse. It
had been overlooked at the time when the house was first occupied. That
night there came from the farmhouse the sound of loud singing, in which,
to everyone’s surprise, the strains of Beasts of England were mixed up.
At about half past nine Napoleon, wearing an old bowler hat of
Mr. Jones’s, was distinctly seen to emerge from the back door, gallop
rapidly round the yard, and disappear indoors again. But in the morning
a deep silence hung over the farmhouse. Not a pig appeared to be
stirring. It was nearly nine o’clock when Squealer made his appearance,
walking slowly and dejectedly, his eyes dull, his tail hanging limply
behind him, and with every appearance of being seriously ill. He called
the animals together and told them that he had a terrible piece of news
to impart. Comrade Napoleon was dying!</p>
<p>A cry of lamentation went up. Straw was laid down outside the doors
of the farmhouse, and the animals walked on tiptoe. With tears in their
eyes they asked one another what they should do if their Leader were
taken away from them. A rumour went round that Snowball had after all
contrived to introduce poison into Napoleon’s food. At eleven o’clock
Squealer came out to make another announcement. As his last act upon
earth, Comrade Napoleon had pronounced a solemn decree: the drinking of
alcohol was to be punished by death.</p>
<p>By the evening, however, Napoleon appeared to be somewhat better, and
the following morning Squealer was able to tell them that he was well on
the way to recovery. By the evening of that day Napoleon was back at
work, and on the next day it was learned that he had instructed Whymper
to purchase in Willingdon some VIII</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>booklets on brewing and distilling. A week later Napoleon gave orders
that the small paddock beyond the orchard, which it had previously been
intended to set aside as a grazing−ground for animals who were past
work, was to be ploughed up. It was given out that the pasture was
exhausted and needed re−seeding; but it soon became known that Napoleon
intended to sow it with barley.</p>
<p>About this time there occurred a strange incident which hardly anyone
was able to understand. One night at about twelve o’clock there was a
loud crash in the yard, and the animals rushed out of their stalls. It
was a moonlit night. At the foot of the end wall of the big barn, where
the Seven Commandments were written, there lay a ladder broken in two
pieces. Squealer, temporarily stunned, was sprawling beside it, and near
at hand there lay a lantern, a paint−brush, and an overturned pot of
white paint. The dogs immediately made a ring round Squealer, and
escorted him back to the farmhouse as soon as he was able to walk. None
of the animals could form any idea as to what this meant, except old
Benjamin, who nodded his muzzle with a knowing air, and seemed to
understand, but would say nothing.</p>
<p>But a few days later Muriel, reading over the Seven Commandments to
herself, noticed that there was yet another of them which the animals
had remembered wrong. They had thought the Fifth Commandment was</p>
<p>“No animal shall drink alcohol,“ but there were two words that they
had forgotten. Actually the Commandment read: “No animal shall drink
alcohol to excess.“ I</p>
<p>XBOXER’S split hoof was a long time in healing. They had started the
rebuilding of the windmill the day after the victory celebrations were
ended Boxer refused to take even a day off work, and made it a point of
honour not to let it be seen that he was in pain. In the evenings he
would admit privately to Clover that the hoof troubled him a great deal.
Clover treated the hoof with poultices of herbs which she prepared by
chewing them, and both she and Benjamin urged Boxer to work less hard.
“A horse’s lungs do not last for ever,“ she said to him. But Boxer would
not listen. He had, he said, only one real ambition left−to see the
windmill well under way before he reached the age for retirement.</p>
<p>At the beginning, when the laws of Animal Farm were first formulated,
the retiring age had been fixed for horses and pigs at twelve, for cows
at fourteen, for dogs at nine, for sheep at seven, and for hens and
geese at five. Liberal old−age pensions had been agreed upon. As yet no
animal had actually retired on pension, but of late the subject had been
discussed more and more. Now that the small field beyond the orchard had
been set aside for barley, it was rumoured that a corner of the large
pasture was to be fenced off and turned into a grazing−ground for
superannuated animals. For a horse, it was said, the pension would be
five pounds of corn a day and, in winter, fifteen pounds of hay, with a
carrot or possibly an apple on public holidays. Boxer’s twelfth birthday
was due in the late summer of the following year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile life was hard. The winter was as cold as the last one had
been, and food was even shorter. Once again all rations were reduced,
except those of the pigs and the dogs. A too rigid equality in rations,
Squealer explained, would have been contrary to the principles of
Animalism. In any case he had no difficulty in proving to the other
animals that they were not in reality short of food, whatever the
appearances might be. For the time being, certainly, it had been found
necessary to make a readjustment of rations (Squealer always spoke of it
as a “readjustment,“ never as a “reduction“), but in comparison with the
days of Jones, the improvement was enormous. Reading out the figures in
a shrill, rapid voice, he proved to them in detail that they had more
oats, more hay, more turnips than they had had in Jones’s day, that they
worked shorter hours, that their drinking water was of better quality,
that they lived longer, that a larger proportion of their young ones
survived infancy, and that they had more straw in their stalls and
suffered less from fleas. The animals believed every word of it. Truth
to tell, Jones and all he stood for had almost faded out of their
memories. They knew that life nowadays was harsh and bare, that they
were often hungry and often cold, and that they I</p>
<p>X33</p>
<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>were usually working when they were not asleep. But doubtless it had
been worse in the old days. They were glad to believe so. Besides, in
those days they had been slaves and now they were free, and that made
all the difference, as Squealer did not fail to point out.</p>
<p>There were many more mouths to feed now. In the autumn the four sows
had all littered about simultaneously, producing thirty−one young pigs
between them. The young pigs were piebald, and as Napoleon was the only
boar on the farm, it was possible to guess at their parentage. It was
announced that later, when bricks and timber had been purchased, a
schoolroom would be built in the farmhouse garden. For the time being,
the young pigs were given their instruction by Napoleon himself in the
farmhouse kitchen. They took their exercise in the garden, and were
discouraged from playing with the other young animals. About this time,
too, it was laid down as a rule that when a pig and any other animal met
on the path, the other animal must stand aside: and also that all pigs,
of whatever degree, were to have the privilege of wearing green ribbons
on their tails on Sundays.</p>
<p>The farm had had a fairly successful year, but was still short of
money. There were the bricks, sand, and lime for the schoolroom to be
purchased, and it would also be necessary to begin saving up again for
the machinery for the windmill. Then there were lamp oil and candles for
the house, sugar for Napoleon’s own table (he forbade this to the other
pigs, on the ground that it made them fat), and all the usual
replacements such as tools, nails, string, coal, wire, scrap−iron, and
dog biscuits. A stump of hay and part of the potato crop were sold off,
and the contract for eggs was increased to six hundred a week, so that
that year the hens barely hatched enough chicks to keep their numbers at
the same level. Rations, reduced in December, were reduced again in
February, and lanterns in the stalls were forbidden to save Oil. But the
pigs seemed comfortable enough, and in fact were putting on weight if
anything. One afternoon in late February a warm, rich, appetising scent,
such as the animals had never smelt before, wafted itself across the
yard from the little brew−house, which had been disused in Jones’s time,
and which stood beyond the kitchen. Someone said it was the smell of
cooking barley. The animals sniffed the air hungrily and wondered
whether a warm mash was being prepared for their supper. But no warm
mash appeared, and on the following Sunday it was announced that from
now onwards all barley would be reserved for the pigs. The field beyond
the orchard had already been sown with barley. And the news soon leaked
out that every pig was now receiving a ration of a pint of beer daily,
with half a gallon for Napoleon himself, which was always served to him
in the Crown Derby soup tureen.</p>
<p>But if there were hardships to be borne, they were partly offset by
the fact that life nowadays had a greater dignity than it had had
before. There were more songs, more speeches, more processions. Napoleon
had commanded that once a week there should be held something called a
Spontaneous Demonstration, the object of which was to celebrate the
struggles and triumphs of Animal Farm. At the appointed time the animals
would leave their work and march round the precincts of the farm in
military formation, with the pigs leading, then the horses, then the
cows, then the sheep, and then the poultry. The dogs flanked the
procession and at the head of all marched Napoleon’s black cockerel.
Boxer and Clover always carried between them a green banner marked with
the hoof and the horn and the caption, “Long live Comrade Napoleon! “
Afterwards there were recitations of poems composed in Napoleon’s
honour, and a speech by Squealer giving particulars of the latest
increases in the production of foodstuffs, and on occasion a shot was
fired from the gun. The sheep were the greatest devotees of the
Spontaneous Demonstration, and if anyone complained (as a few animals
sometimes did, when no pigs or dogs were near) that they wasted time and
meant a lot of standing about in the cold, the sheep were sure to
silence him with a tremendous bleating of “Four legs good, two legs
bad!“ But by and large the animals enjoyed these celebrations. They
found it comforting to be reminded that, after all, they were truly
their own masters and that the work they did was for their own benefit.
So that, what with the songs, the processions, Squealer’s lists of
figures, the thunder of the gun, the crowing of the cockerel, and the
fluttering of the flag, they were able to forget that their bellies were
empty, at least part of the time.</p>
