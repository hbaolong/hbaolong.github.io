<p>Animal Farm</p>
<p>Never through me shalt thou come to harm!</p>
<p>and this was sung every Sunday morning after the hoisting of the
flag. But somehow neither the words nor the tune ever seemed to the
animals to come up to Beasts of England. VIII</p>
<p>A FEW days later, when the terror caused by the executions had died
down, some of the animals remembered−or thought they remembered−that the
Sixth Commandment decreed “No animal shall kill any other animal.“ And
though no one cared to mention it in the hearing of the pigs or the
dogs, it was felt that the killings which had taken place did not square
with this. Clover asked Benjamin to read her the Sixth Commandment, and
when Benjamin, as usual, said that he refused to meddle in such matters,
she fetched Muriel. Muriel read the Commandment for her. It ran: “No
animal shall kill any other animal without cause.“ Somehow or other, the
last two words had slipped out of the animals’ memory. But they saw now
that the Commandment had not been violated; for clearly there was good
reason for killing the traitors who had leagued themselves with
Snowball.</p>
<p>Throughout the year the animals worked even harder than they had
worked in the previous year To rebuild the windmill, with walls twice as
thick as before, and to finish it by the appointed date, together with
the regular work of the farm, was a tremendous labour. There were times
when it seemed to the animals that they worked longer hours and fed no
better than they had done in Jones’s day. On Sunday mornings Squealer,
holding down a long strip of paper with his trotter, would read out to
them lists of figures proving that the production of every class of
foodstuff had increased by two hundred per cent, three hundred per cent,
or five hundred per cent, as the case might be. The animals saw no
reason to disbelieve him, especially as they could no longer remember
very clearly what conditions had been like before the Rebellion. All the
same, there were days when they felt that they would sooner have had
less figures and more food. All orders were now issued through Squealer
or one of the other pigs. Napoleon himself was not seen in public as
often as once in a fortnight. When he did appear, he was attended not
only by his retinue of dogs but by a black cockerel who marched in front
of him and acted as a kind of trumpeter, letting out a loud</p>
<p>“cock−a−doodle−doo“ before Napoleon spoke. Even in the farmhouse, it
was said, Napoleon inhabited separate apartments from the others. He
took his meals alone, with two dogs to wait upon him, and always ate
from the Crown Derby dinner service which had been in the glass cupboard
in the drawing−room. It was also announced that the gun would be fired
every year on Napoleon’s birthday, as well as on the other two
anniversaries.</p>
<p>Napoleon was now never spoken of simply as “Napoleon.“ He was always
referred to in formal style as “our Leader, Comrade Napoleon,“ and this
pigs liked to invent for him such titles as Father of All Animals,
Terror of Mankind, Protector of the Sheep−fold, Ducklings’ Friend, and
the like. In his speeches, Squealer would talk with the tears rolling
down his cheeks of Napoleon’s wisdom the goodness of his heart, and the
deep love he bore to all animals everywhere, even and especially the
unhappy animals who still lived in ignorance and slavery on other farms.
It had become usual to give Napoleon the credit for every successful
achievement and every stroke of good fortune. You would often hear one
hen remark to another, “Under the guidance of our Leader, Comrade
Napoleon, I have laid five eggs in six days“; or two cows, enjoying a
drink at the pool, would exclaim, “Thanks to the leadership of Comrade
Napoleon, how excellent this water tastes!“ The general feeling on the
farm was well expressed in a poem entitled Comrade Napoleon, which was
composed by Minimus and which ran as follows:</p>
<p>Friend of fatherless!</p>
