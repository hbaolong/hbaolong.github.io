<h4 id="the-domestication-of-hunch">5. The Domestication of Hunch</h4>
<p>My landlady, a voluble man, arranged my journey into the East. “If a
person wants to visit Fastnesses he’s got to cross the Kargav. Over the
mountains, into Old Karhide, to Her, the old Kings’ City. Now I’ll tell
you, a hearth-fellow of mine runs a landboat caravan over the Eskar Pass
and yesterday he was telling me over a cup of orsh that they’re going to
make their first trip this summer on Getheny Osme, it having been such a
warm spring and the road already clear up to Engohar and the plows will
have the pass clear in another couple of days. Now you won’t catch me
crossing the Kargav, Erhenrang for me and a roof over my head. But I’m a
Yomeshta, praise to the nine hundred Throne-Upholders and blest be the
Milk of Meshe, and one can be a Yomeshta anywhere. We’re a lot of
newcomers, see, for my Lord Meshe was born 2,202 years-ago, but the Old
Way of the Handdara goes back ten thousand years before that. You have
to go back to the Old Land if you’re after the Old Way. Now look here,
Mr. Ai, I’ll have a room in this island for you whenever you come back,
but I believe you’re a wise man to be going out of Erhenrang for a
while, for everybody knows that the Traitor made a great show of
befriending you at the Palace. Now with old Tibe as the King’s Ear
things will go smooth again. Now if you go down to the New Port you’ll
find my hearth-fellow there, and if you tell him I sent you …”</p>
<p>And so on. He was, as I said, voluble, and having discovered that I
had no shifgrethor took every chance to give me advice, though even he
disguised it with ifs and as-ifs. He was the superintendent of my
island; I thought of him as my landlady, for he had fat buttocks that
wagged as he walked, and a soft fat face, and a prying, spying, ignoble,
kindly nature. He was good to me, and also showed my room while I was
out to thrill-seekers for a small fee: See the Mysterious Envoy’s room!
He was so feminine in looks and manner that I once asked him how many
children he had. He looked glum. He had never borne any. He had,
however, sired four. It was one of the little jolts I was always
getting. Cultural shock was nothing much compared to the biological
shock I suffered as a human male among human beings who were,
five-sixths of the time, hermaphroditic neuters.</p>
<p>The radio bulletins were full of the doings of the new Prime
Minister, Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe. Much of the news concerned affairs
up north in the Sinoth Valley. Tibe evidently was going to press
Karhide’s claim to that region: precisely the kind of action which, on
any other world at this stage of civilization, would lead to war. But on
Gethen nothing led to war. Quarrels, murders, feuds, forays, vendettas,
assassinations, tortures and abominations, all these were in their
repertory of human accomplishments; but they did not go to war. They
lacked, it seemed, the capacity to mobilize. They behaved like animals,
in that respect; or like women. They did not behave like men, or ants.
At any rate they never yet had done so. What I knew of Orgoreyn
indicated that it had become, over the last five or six centuries, an
increasingly mobilizable society, a real nation-state. The
prestige-competition”, heretofore mostly economic, might force Karhide
to emulate its larger neighbor, to become a nation instead of a family
quarrel, as Estraven had said; to become, as Estraven had also said,
patriotic. If this occurred the Gethenians might have an excellent
chance of achieving the condition of war.</p>
<p>I wanted to go to Orgoreyn and see if my guesses concerning it were
sound, but I wanted to finish up with Karhide first; so I sold another
ruby to the scar-faced jeweler in Eng Street, and with no baggage but my
money, my ansible, a few instruments and a change of clothes, set off as
passenger on a trade-caravan on the first day of the first month of
summer.</p>
<p>The landboats left at daybreak from the windswept loading-yards of
the New Port. They drove under the Arch and turned east, twenty bulky,
quiet-running, barge-like trucks on caterpillar treads, going single
file down the deep streets of Erhenrang through the shadows of morning.
They carried boxes of lenses, reels of soundtapes, spools of copper and
platinum wire, bolts of plant-fiber cloth raised and woven in the West
Fall, chests of dried fish-flakes from the Gulf, crates of ballbearings
and other small machine parts, and ten truck-loads of Orgota
kardik-grain: all bound for the Pering Storm-border, the northeast
corner of the land. All shipping on the Great Continent is by these
electric-powered trucks, which go on barges on the rivers and canals
where possible. During the deep-snow months, slow tractor-plows,
power-sledges, and the erratic ice-ships on frozen rivers are the only
transport beside skis and man hauled sledges; during the Thaw no form of
transport is reliable; so most freight traffic goes with a rush, come
summer. The roads then are thick with caravans. Traffic is controlled,
each vehicle or caravan being required to keep in constant radio touch
with checkpoints along the way. It all moves along, however crowded,
quite steadily at the rate of 25 miles per hour (Terran). Gethenians
could make their vehicles go faster, but they do not. If asked why not,
they answer “Why?” Like asking Terrans why all our vehicles must go so
fast; we answer “Why not?” No disputing tastes. Terrans tend to feel
they’ve got to get ahead, make progress. The people of Winter, who
always live in the Year One, feel that progress is less important than
presence. My tastes were Terran, and leaving Ehrenrang I was impatient
with the methodical pace of the caravan; I wanted to get out and run. I
was glad to get clear of those long stone streets overhung with black,
steep roofs dawn I was awake and saw that we had left everything behind
except rock, and ice, and light, and the narrow road always going up and
up under our treads. I thought, shivering, that there are things that
outweigh comfort, unless one is an old woman or a cat.</p>
<p>No more inns now, among these appalling slopes of snow and granite.
At mealtimes the landboats came silently to a halt one after the other
on some thirty-degree, snow-encroached grade, and everybody climbed down
from the cabs and gathered about the sleeper, from which bowls of hot
soup were served, slabs of dried breadapple, and sour beer in mugs. We
stood about stamping in the snow, gobbling up food and drink, backs to
the bitter wind that was filled with a glittering dust of dry snow. Then
back into the landboats, and on, and up. At noon in the passes of
Wehoth, at about 14,000 feet, it was 82° F. in the sun and 13° in the
shade. The electric engines were so quiet that one could hear avalanches
grumble down immense blue slopes on the far side of chasms twenty miles
across.</p>
<p>Late that afternoon we passed the summit, at Eskar, 15,200 feet.
Looking up the slope of the southern face of Kostor, op which we had
been infinitesimally crawling all day, I saw a queer rock-formation a
quarter mile or so above the road, a castle-like outcropping. “See the
Fastness up there?” said the driver.</p>
<p>“That’s a building?”</p>
<p>“That’s Ariskostor Fastness.”</p>
<p>“But no one could live up here.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the Old Men can. I used to drive in a caravan that brought up
their food from Erhenrang, late in summer. Of course they can’t get in
or out for ten or eleven months of the year, but they don’t care.
There’s seven or eight Indwellers up there.”</p>
<p>I stared up at the buttresses of rough rock, solitary in the huge
solitude of the heights, and I did not believe the driver; but I
suspended my disbelief. If any people could survive in such a frozen
aerie, they would be Karhiders.</p>
<p>The road descending swung far north and far south, edging along
precipices, for the east slope of the Kargav is harsher than the west,
falling to the plains in great stairsteps, the raw fault-blocks of the
mountains’ making. At sunset we saw a tiny string of dots creeping
through a huge white shadow seven thousand feet below: a landboat
caravan that had left Erhenrang a day ahead of us. Late the next day we
had got down there and were creeping along that same snow-slope, very
softly, not sneezing, lest we bring down the avalanche. From there we
saw for a while, away below and beyond us eastward, vague vast lands
blurred with clouds and shadows of clouds and streaked with silver of
rivers, the Plains of Rer.</p>
<p>At dusk of the fourth day out from Erhenrang we came to Rer. Between
the two cities lie eleven hundred miles, and a wall several miles high,
and two or three thousand years. The caravan halted outside the Western
Gate, where it would be shifted onto canal-barges. No landboat or car
can enter Rer. It was built before Karhiders used powered vehicles, and
they have been using them for over twenty centuries. There are no
streets in Rer. There are covered walks, tunnel-like, which in summer
one may walk through or on top of as one pleases. The houses and islands
and Hearths sit every which way, chaotic, in a profuse prodigious
confusion that suddenly culminates (as anarchy will do in Karhide) in
splendor: the great Towers of the Un-Palace, blood-red, windowless.
Built seventeen centuries ago, those towers housed the kings of Karhide
for a thousand years, until Argaven Harge, first of his dynasty, crossed
the Kargav and settled the great valley of the West Fall. All the
buildings of Rer are fantastically massive, deep-founded, weatherproof
and waterproof. In winter the wind of the plains may keep the city clear
of snow, but when it blizzards and piles up they do not clear the
streets, having no streets to clear. They use the stone tunnels, or
burrow temporary ones in the snow. Nothing of the houses but the roof
sticks out above the snow, and the winter-doors may be set under the
eaves or in the roof itself, like dormers. The Thaw is the bad time on
that plain of many rivers. The tunnels then are storm-sewers, and the
spaces between buildings become canals or lakes, on which the people of
Rer boat to their business, fending off small ice-floes with the oars.
And always, over the dust of summer, the snowy roof-jumble of winter, or
the floods of spring, the red Towers loom, the empty heart of the city,
indestructible.</p>
<p>I lodged in a dreary overpriced inn crouching in the lee of the
Towers. I got up at dawn after many bad dreams, and paid the extortioner
for bed and breakfast and inaccurate directions as to the way I should
take, and set forth afoot to find Otherhord, an ancient Fastness not far
from Rer. I was lost within fifty yards of the inn. By keeping the
Towers behind me and the huge white loom of the Kargav on my right, I
got out of the city headed south, and a farmer’s child met on the road
told me where to turn off for Otherhord.</p>
<p>I came there at noon. That is, I came somewhere at noon, but I wasn’t
sure where. It was mainly a forest or a thick wood; but the woods were
even more carefully tended than is usual in that country of careful
foresters, and the path led along the hillside right in among the trees.
After a while I became aware that there was a wooden hut just off the
path to my right, and then I noticed a quite large wooden building a
little farther off to my left; and from somewhere there came a delicious
smell of fresh frying fish.</p>
<p>I went slowly along the path, a little uneasy. I didn’t know how the
Handdarata felt about tourists. I knew very little about them in fact.
The Handdara is a religion without institution, without priests, without
hierarchy, without vows, without creed; I am still unable to say whether
it has a God or not. It is elusive. It is always somewhere else. Its
only fixed manifestation is in the Fastnesses, retreats to which people
may retire and spend the night or a lifetime. I wouldn’t have been
pursuing this curiously intangible cult into its secret places at all,
if I hadn’t wanted to answer the question left unanswered by the
Investigators: What are the Foretellers, and what do they actually
do?</p>
<p>I had been longer in Karhide now than the Investigators had, and I
doubted that there was anything to the stories of Foretellers and their
prophecies. Legends of prediction are common throughout the whole
Household of Man. Gods speak, spirits speak, computers speak. Oracular
ambiguity or statistical probability provides loopholes, and
discrepancies are expunged by Faith. However, the legends were worth
investigating. I hadn’t yet convinced any Karhider of the existence of
telepathic communication; they wouldn’t believe it till they “saw” it:
my position exactly, regarding the Foretellers of the Handdara.</p>
<p>As I went-on along the path I realized that a whole village or town
was scattered about in the shadow of that slanting forest, all as random
as Rer was, but secretive, peaceful, rural. Over every roof and path
hung the boughs of the hemmens, the commonest tree of Winter, a stout
conifer with thick pale-scarlet needles. Hemmen-cones littered the
branching paths, the wind was scented with hemmen-pollen, and all the
houses were built of and came slowly towards us, I felt an awe of him.
In that noon sunlight he shone of his own light.</p>
<p>He was as tall as I, and slender, with a clear, open, and beautiful
face. As his eyes met mine I was suddenly moved to bespeak him, to try
to reach him with the mindspeech I had never used since I landed on
Winter, and should not use, yet. The impulse was stronger than the
restraint. I bespoke him. There was no response. No contact was made. He
continued to look straight at me. After a moment he smiled and said in a
soft, rather high voice, “You’re the Envoy, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>I stammered and said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>“My name is Faxe. We’re honored to receive you. Will you stay with us
in Otherhord a while?”</p>
<p>“Willingly. I am seeking to learn about your practice of Foretelling.
And if there’s anything I can tell you in return about what I am, where
I come from-”</p>
<p>“Whatever you like,” said Faxe with a serene smile. “This is a
pleasant thing, that you should cross the Ocean of Space, and then add
another thousand miles and a crossing of the Kargav to your journey to
come to us here.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to come to Otherhord because of the fame of its
predictions.”</p>
<p>“You want to watch us foretelling, then, perhaps. Or have you a
question of your own?”</p>
<p>His clear eyes compelled truth. “I don’t know,” I said.</p>
<p>“Nusuth,” said he, “it doesn’t matter. Perhaps if you stay a while
you’ll find if you have a question, or no question. . . . There are only
certain times, you know, when the Foretellers are able to meet together,
so in any case you’d dwell with us some days.”</p>
<p>I did, and they were pleasant days. Time was unorganized except for
the communal work, field labor, gardening, woodcutting, maintenance, for
which transients such as myself were called on by whatever group most
needed a hand. Aside from the work, a day might pass without a word
broken; those I talked -with most often were young Goss, and Faxe the
Weaver, whose extraordinary character, as limpid and unfathomable as a
well of very clear water, was a quintessence of the character of the
place. In the evenings there might be a gathering in the hearth-room of
one or another of the low, tree-surrounded houses; there was
conversation, and beer, and there might be music, the vigorous music of
Karhide, melodically simple but rhythmically complex, always played
extempore. One night two Indwellers danced, men so old that their hair
had whitened, and their limbs were skinny, and the downward folds at the
outer eye-corners half hid their dark eyes. Their dancing was slow,
precise, controlled; it fascinated eye and mind. They began dancing
during Third Hour after dinner. Musicians joined in and dropped out at
will, all but the drummer who never stopped his subtle changing beat.
The two old dancers were still dancing at Sixth Hour, midnight, after
five Terran hours. This was the first time I had seen the phenomenon of
dothe - the voluntary, controlled use of what we call “hysterical
strength”-and thereafter I was readier to believe tales concerning the
Old Men of the Handdara.</p>
<p>It was an introverted life, self-sufficient, stagnant, steeped in
that singular “ignorance” prized by the Hand-darata and obedient to
their rule of inactivity or noninterference. That rule (expressed in the
word nusuth, which I have to translate as “no matter”) is the heart of
the cult, and I don’t pretend to understand it. But I began to
understand Karhide better, after a halfmonth in Otherhord. Under that
nation’s politics and parades and passions runs an old darkness,
passive, anarchic, silent, the fecund darkness of the Handdara.</p>
<p>And out of that silence inexplicably rises the Foreteller’s
voice.</p>
<p>Young Goss, who enjoyed acting as my guide, told me that my question
to the Foretellers could concern anything and be phrased as I liked.
“The more qualified and limited the question, the more exact the
answer,” he said. “Vagueness breeds vagueness. And some questions of
course are not answerable.”</p>
<p>“What if I ask one of those?” I inquired. This hedging seemed
sophisticated, but not unfamiliar. But I did not expect his answer: “The
Weaver will refuse it. Unanswerable questions have wrecked Foretelling
groups.”</p>
<p>“Wrecked them?”</p>
<p>“Do you know the story of the Lord of Shorth, who forced the
Foretellers of Asen Fastness to answer the question What is the meaning
of life? Well, it was a couple of thousand years ago. The Foretellers
stayed in the darkness for six days and nights. At the end, all the
Celibates were catatonic, the Zanies were dead, the Pervert clubbed the
Lord of Shorth to death with a stone, and the Weaver . . . He was a man
named Meshe.”</p>
<p>“The founder of the Yomesh cult?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Goss, and laughed as if the story was very funny, but I
didn’t know whether the joke was on the Yomeshta or on me.</p>
<p>I had decided to ask a yes-or-no question, which might at least make
plain the extent and kind of obscurity or ambiguity in the answer. Faxe
confirmed what Goss had said, that the matter of the question could be
one of which the Foretellers were perfectly ignorant. I could ask if the
hoolm crops would be good this year in the northern hemisphere of S, and
they would answer, having no previous knowledge even of the existence of
a planet called S. This seemed to put the business on the plane of pure
chance divination, along with yarrow stalks and flipped coins. No, said
Faxe, not at all, chance was not involved. The whole process was in fact
precisely the reverse of chance.</p>
<p>“Then you mindread.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Faxe, with his serene and candid smile.</p>
<p>“You mindread without knowing you’re doing it, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“What good would that be? If the asker knew the answer he wouldn’t
pay our price for it.”</p>
<p>I chose a question to which I certainly lacked the answer. Only time
could prove the Foretelling right or wrong, unless it was, as I
expected, one of those admirable professional prophecies applicable to
any outcome. It was not a trivial question; I had given up the notion of
asking when it would stop raining, or some such trifle, when I learned
that the undertaking was a hard and dangerous one for the nine
Foretellers of Otherhord. The cost was high for the asker-two of my
rubies went to the coffers of the Fastness-but higher for the answerers.
And as I got to know Faxe, if it became difficult to believe that he was
a professional faker it became still more difficult to believe that he
was an honest, self-deluded faker; his intelligence was as hard, clear,
and polished as my rubies. I dared set no trap for him. I asked what I
most wanted to know.</p>
<p>On Onnetherhad, the 18th of the month, the nine met together in a big
building usually kept locked: one high hall, stone-floored and cold,
dimly lighted by a couple of slit-windows and a fire in the deep hearth
at one end. They sat on the bare stone in a circle, all of them cloaked
and hooded, rough still shapes like a circle of dolmens in the faint
glow of the fire yards away. Goss, and a couple of other young
Indwellers, and a physician from the nearest Domain, watched in silence
from seats by the hearth while I crossed the hall and entered the
circle.</p>
<p>It was all very informal, and very tense. One of the hooded figures
looked up as I came amongst them, and I saw a strange face,
coarse-featured, heavy, with insolent eyes watching me.</p>
<p>Faxe sat cross-legged, not moving, but charged, full of a gathering
force that made his light, soft voice crack like an electric bolt.
“Ask,” he said.</p>
<p>I stood within the circle and asked my question. “Will this world
Gethen be a member of the Ekumen of Known Worlds, five years from
now?”</p>
<p>Silence. I stood there, I hung in the center of a spider-web woven of
silence.</p>
<p>“It is answerable,” the Weaver said quietly.</p>
<p>There was a relaxation. The hooded stones seemed to soften into
movement; the one who had looked so strangely at me began to whisper to
his neighbor. I left the circle and joined the watchers by the
hearth.</p>
<p>Two of the Foretellers remained withdrawn, unspeaking. One of them
lifted his left hand from time to time and patted the floor lightly and
swiftly ten or twenty times, then sat motionless again. I had seen
neither of them before; they were the Zanies, Goss said. They were
insane. Goss called them “time-dividers,” which may mean schizophrenics.
Karhidish psychologists, though lacking mindspeech and thus like blind
surgeons, were ingenious with drugs, hypnosis, spotshock, cryonic touch,
and various mental therapies; I asked if these two psychopaths could not
be cured. “Cured?” Goss said. “Would you cure a singer of his
voice?”</p>
<p>Five others of the circle were Indwellers of Otherhord, adepts in the
Handdara disciplines of Presence and also, said Goss, so long as they
remained Foretellers, celibate, taking no mate during their periods of
sexual potency. One of these Celibates must be in kemmer during the
Foretelling. I could pick him out, having learned to notice the subtle
physical intensification, a kind of brightness, that signalizes the
first phase of kemmer.</p>
<p>Beside the kemmerer sat the Pervert.</p>
<p>“He came up from Spreve with the physician,” Goss told me. “Some
Foretelling groups artifically arouse perversion in a normal
person-injecting female or male hormones during the days before a
session. It’s better to have a natural one. He’s willing to come; likes
the notoriety.”</p>
<p>Goss used the pronoun that designates a male animal, not the pronoun
for a human being in the masculine role of kemmer. He looked a little
embarrassed. Karhiders discuss sexual matters freely, and talk about
kemmer with both reverence and gusto, but they are reticent about
discussing perversions-at least, they were with me. Excessive
prolongation of the kemmer period, with permanent hormonal imbalance
toward the male or the female, causes what they call perversion; it is
not rare; three or four percent of adults may be physiological perverts
or abnormal-normals, by our standard. They are not excluded from
society, but they are tolerated with some disdain, as homosexuals are in
many bisexual societies. The Karhidish slang for them is halfdeads. They
are sterile.</p>
<p>The Pervert of the group, after that first long strange stare at me,
paid no heed to anyone but the one next to him, the kemmerer, whose
increasingly active sexuality would be further roused and finally
stimulated into full, female sexual capacity by the insistent,
exaggerated maleness of the Pervert. The Pervert kept talking softly,
leaning towards the kemmerer, who answered little and seemed to recoil.
None of the others had spoken for a long time now, there was no sound
but the whisper, whisper of the Pervert’s voice. Faxe was steadily
watching one of the Zanies. The Pervert laid his hand quickly and softly
on the kemmerer’s hand. The kernmerer avoided the touch hastily, with
fear or disgust, and looked across at Faxe as if for help. Faxe did not
move. The kemmerer kept his place, and kept still when the Pervert
touched him again. One of the Zanies lifted up his face and laughed a
long false crooning laugh, “Ah-ah-ah-ah….”</p>
<p>Faxe raised his hand. At once each face in the circle turned to him
as if he had gathered up their gazes into a sheaf, a skein.</p>
<p>It had been afternoon and raining when we entered the hall. The gray
light had soon died out of the slit-windows under the eaves. Now whitish
strips of light stretched like slanting phantasmal sails, long triangles
and oblongs, from wall to floor, over the faces of the nine; dull scraps
and shreds of light from the moon rising over the forest, outside. The
fire had burned down long since and there was no light but those strips
and slants of dimness creeping across the circle, sketching out a face,
a hand, a moveless back. For a while I saw Faxe’s profile rigid as pale
stone in a diffuse dust of light. The diagonal of moonlight crept on and
came to a black hump, the kemmerer, head bowed on his knees, hands
clenched on the floor, body shaken by a regular tremor repeated by the
slutter-pat-pat of the Zany’s hands on stone in darkness across the
circle. They were all connected, all of them, as if they were the
suspension-points of a spiderweb. I felt, whether I wished or not, the
connection, the communication that ran, wordless, inarticulate, through
Faxe, and which Faxe was trying to pattern and control, for he was the
center, the Weaver. The dim light fragmented and died away creeping up
the eastern wall. The web of force, of tension, of silence, grew.</p>
<p>I tried to keep out of contact with the minds of the Foretellers. I
was made very uneasy by that silent electric tension, by the sense of
being drawn in, of becoming a point or figure in the pattern, in the
web. But when I set up a barrier, it was worse: I felt cut off and
cowered inside my own mind obsessed by hallucinations of sight and
touch, a stew of wild images and notions, abrupt visions and sensations
all sexually charged and grotesquely violent, a red-and-black seething
of erotic rage. I was surrounded by great gaping pits with ragged lips,
vaginas, wounds, hellmouths, I lost my balance, I was falling. … If I
could not shut out this chaos I would fall indeed, I would go mad, and
there was no shutting it out. The empathic and paraverbal forces at
work, immensely powerful and confused, rising out of the perversion and
frustration of sex, out of an insanity that distorts time, and out of an
appalling discipline of total concentration and apprehension of
immediate reality, were far beyond my restraint or control. And yet they
were controlled: the center was still Faxe. Hours and seconds passed,
the moonlight shone on the wrong wall, there was no moonlight only
darkness, and in the center of all darkness Faxe: the Weaver: a woman, a
woman dressed in light. The light was silver, the silver was armor, an
armored woman with a sword. The light burned sudden and intolerable,-
the light along her limbs, the fire, and she screamed aloud in terror
and pain, “Yes, yes, yes!”</p>
<p>The crooning laugh of the Zany began, “Ah-ah-ah-ah,” and rose higher
and higher into a wavering yell that went on and on, much longer than
any voice could go on yelling, right across time. There was movement in
the darkness, scuffling and shuffling, a redistribution of ancient
centuries, an evasion of foreshadows. “Light, light,” said an immense
voice in vast syllables once or innumerable times. “Light. Log on the
fire, there. Some light.” It was the physician from Spreve. He had
entered the circle. It was all broken. He was kneeling by the Zanies,
the frailest ones, the fuse-points; both of them lay huddled up on the
floor. The kemmerer lay with his head on Faxe’s knees, breathing in
gasps, still trembling; Faxe’s hand, with absent gentleness, stroked his
hair. The Pervert was off by himself in a corner, sullen and dejected.
The session was over, time passed as usual, the web of power had fallen
apart into indignity and weariness. Where was my answer, the riddle of
the oracle, the ambiguous utterance of prophecy?</p>
<p>I knelt down beside Faxe. He looked at me with his clear eyes. For
that instant I saw him as I had seen him in the dark, as a woman armed
in light and burning in a fire, crying out, “Yes-”</p>
<p>Faxe’s soft speaking-voice broke the vision. “Are you answered,
Asker?”</p>
<p>“I am answered, Weaver.”</p>
<p>Indeed I was answered. Five years from now Gethen would be a member
of the Ekumen: yes. No riddles, no hedging. Even then I was aware of the
quality of that answer, not so much a prophecy as an observation. I
could not evade my own certainty that the answer was right. It had the
imperative clarity of a hunch.</p>
<p>We have NAFAL ships and instantaneous transmission and mindspeech,
but we haven’t yet tamed hunch to run in harness; for that trick we must
go to Gethen.</p>
<p>“I serve as the filament,” Faxe said to me a day or two after the
Foretelling. “The energy builds up and builds up in us, always sent back
and back, redoubling the impulse every time, until it breaks through and
the light is in me, around me, I am the light. . . . The Old Man of
Arbin Fastness once said that if the Weaver could be put in a vacuum at
the moment of the Answer, he’d go on burning for years. That’s what the
Yomeshta believe of Meshe: that he saw past and future clear, not for a
moment, but all during his life after the Question of Shorth. It’s hard
to believe. I doubt a man could endure it. But no matter. …”</p>
<p>Nusuth, the ubiquitous and ambiguous negative of the Handdara.</p>
<p>We were strolling side by side, and Faxe looked at me. His face, one
of the most beautiful human faces I ever saw, seemed hard and delicate
as carved stone. “In the darkness,” he said, “there were ten; not nine.
There was a stranger.”</p>
<p>“Yes, there was. I had no barrier against you. You are a Listener,
Faxe, a natural empath; and probably a powerful natural telepath as
well. That’s why you’re the Weaver, the one who can keep the tensions
and responses of the group running in a self-augmenting pattern until
the strain breaks the pattern itself and you reach through for your
answer.”</p>
<p>He listened with grave interest. “It is strange to- see the mysteries
of my discipline from outside, through your eyes. I’ve only seen them
from within, as a disciple.”</p>
<p>“If you permit-if you wish, Faxe, I should like to communicate with
you in mindspeech.” I was sure now that he was a natural Communicant;
his consent and a little practice should serve to lower his unwitting
barrier.</p>
<p>“Once you did that, I would hear what others think?”</p>
<p>“No, no. No more than you do already as an empath. Mindspeech is
communication, voluntarily sent and received.”</p>
<p>“Then why not speak aloud?”</p>
<p>“Well, one can lie, speaking.”</p>
<p>“Not mindspeaking?”</p>
<p>“Not intentionally.”</p>
<p>Faxe considered a while. “That’s a discipline that must arouse the
interest of kings, politicians, men of business.”</p>
<p>“Men of business fought against the use of mindspeech when it first
was found to be a teachable skill; they outlawed it for decades.”</p>
<p>Faxe smiled. “And kings?”</p>
<p>“We have no more kings.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I see that. . . . Well, I thank you, Genry. But my business is
unlearning, not learning. And I’d rather not yet learn an art that would
change the world entirely.”</p>
<p>“By your own foretelling this world will change, and within five
years.”</p>
<p>“And I’ll change with it, Genry. But I have no wish to change
it.”</p>
<p>It was raining, the long, fine rain of Gethenian summer. We walked
under the hemmen-trees on the slopes above the Fastness, where there
were no paths. Light fell gray among dark branches, clear water dropped
from the scarlet needles. The air was chill yet mild, and full of the
sound of rain.</p>
<p>“Faxe, tell me this. You Handdarata have a gift that men on every
world have craved. You have it. You can predict the future. And yet you
live like the rest of us- it doesn’t seem to matter-”</p>
<p>.”How should it matter, Genry?”</p>
<p>“Well, look. For instance, this rivalry between Karhide and Orgoreyn,
this quarrel about the Sinoth Valley. Karhide has lost face badly these
last weeks, I gather. Now why didn’t King Argaven consult his
Foretellers, asking which course to take, or which member of the
kyorremy to choose as prime minister, or something of that sort?”</p>
<p>“The questions are hard to ask.”</p>
<p>“I don’t see why. He might simply ask, Who’ll serve me best as prime
minister?-and leave it at that.”</p>
<p>“He might. But he doesn’t know what serving him best may mean. It
might mean the man chosen would surrender the valley to Orgoreyn, or go
into exile, or assassinate the king; it might mean many things he
wouldn’t expect or accept.”</p>
<p>“He’d have to make his question very precise.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Then there’d be many questions, you see. Even the king must pay
the price.”</p>
<p>“You’d charge him high?”</p>
<p>“Very high,” said Faxe tranquilly. “The Asker pays what he can
afford, as you know. Kings have in fact come to the Foretellers; but not
very often….”</p>
<p>“What if one of the Foretellers is himself a powerful man?”</p>
<p>“Indwellers of the Fastness have no ranks or status. I may be sent to
Erhenrang to the kyorremy; well, if I go, I take back my status and my
shadow, but my foretelling’s at an end. If I had a question while I
served in the kyorremy, I’d go to Orgny Fastness there, pay my price,
and get my answer. But we in the Handdara don’t want answers. It’s hard
to avoid them, but we try to.”</p>
<p>“Faxe, I don’t think I understand.”</p>
<p>“Well, we come here to the Fastnesses mostly to learn what questions
not to ask.”</p>
<p>“But you’re the Answerers!”</p>
<p>“You don’t see yet, Genry, why we perfected and practice
Foretelling?”</p>
<p>“No-”</p>
<p>“To exhibit the perfect uselessness of knowing the answer to the
wrong question.”</p>
<p>I pondered that a good while, as we walked side by side through the
rain, under the dark branches of the Forest of Otherhord. Within the
white hood Faxe’s face was tired and quiet, its light quenched. Yet he
still awed me a little. When he looked at me with his clear, kind,
candid eyes, he looked at me out of a tradition thirteen thousand years
old: a way of thought and way of life so old, so well established, so
integral and coherent as to give a human being the unselfconsciousness,
the authority, the completeness of a wild animal, a great strange
creature who looks straight at you out of his eternal present….</p>
<p>“The unknown,” said Faxe’s soft voice in the forest, “the unforetold,
the unproven, that is what life is based on. Ignorance is the ground of
thought. Unproof is the ground of action. If it were proven that there
is no God there would be no religion. No Handdara, no Yomesh, no hearth
gods, nothing. But also if it were proven that there is a God, there
would be no religion. . . . Tell me, Genry, what is known? What is sure,
predictable, inevitable-the one certain thing you know concerning your
future, and mine?”</p>
<p>“That we shall die.”</p>
<p>“Yes. There’s really only one question that can be answered, Genry,
and we already know the answer. . . . The only thing that makes life
possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes
next.”</p>
