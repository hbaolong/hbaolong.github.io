<h4 id="the-nineteenth-day">4. The Nineteenth Day</h4>
<p>An East Karhidish story, as told in Gorinhering Hearth by Tobord
Chorhawa, and recorded by G. A., 93/1492.</p>
<p>Lord Berosty rem ir Ipe came to Thangering Fastness and offered forty
beryls and half the year’s yield from his orchards as the price of a
Foretelling, and the price was acceptable. He set his question to the
Weaver Odren, and the question was, On what day shall I die?</p>
<p>The Foretellers gathered and went together into the darkness. At the
end of darkness Odren spoke the answer: You will die on Odstreth (the
19th day of any month).</p>
<p>“In what month? in how many years?” cried Berosty, but the bond was
broken, and there was no answer. He ran into the circle and took the
Weaver Odren by the throat choking him and shouted that if he got no
further answer he would break the Weaver’s neck. Others pulled him off
and held him, though he was a strong man. He strained against their
hands and cried out, “Give me the answer!”</p>
<p>Odren said, “It is given, and the price paid. Go.”</p>
<p>Raging then Berosty rem ir Ipe returned to Charuthe, the third Domain
of his family, a poor place in northern Osnoriner, which he had made
poorer in getting together the price of a Foretelling. He shut himself
up in the strong-place, in the highest rooms of the Hearth-Tower, and
would not come out for friend or foe, for seedtime or harvest, for
kerrimer or foray, all that month and the next and the next, and six
months went by and ten months went by, and he still kept like a prisoner
to his room, waiting. On Onnetherhad and Odstreth (the 18th and 19th
days of the month) he would not eat any food, nor would he drink, nor
would he sleep.</p>
<p>His kemmering by love and vow was Herbor of the Geganner clan. This
Herbor came in the month of Grende to Thangering Fastness and said to
the Weaver, “I seek a Foretelling.”</p>
<p>“What have you to pay?” Odren asked, for he saw that the man was
poorly dressed and badly shod, and his sledge was old, and everything
about him wanted mending.</p>
<p>“I will give my life,” said Herbor.</p>
<p>“Have you nothing else, my lord?” Odren asked him, speaking now as to
a great nobleman, “nothing else to give?”</p>
<p>“I have nothing else,” said Herbor. “But I do not know if my life is
of any value to you here.”</p>
<p>“No,” said Odren, “it is of no value to us.”</p>
<p>Then Herbor fell on his knees, struck down by shame and love, and
cried to Odren, “I beg you to answer my question. It is not for
myself!”</p>
<p>“For whom, then?”“ asked the Weaver.</p>
<p>“For my lord and kemmering Ashe Berosty,” said the man, and he wept.
“He has no love nor joy nor lordship since he came here and got that
answer which _was no answer. He will die of it.”</p>
<p>“That he will: what does a man die of but his death?” said the Weaver
Odren. But Berber’s passion moved him, and at length he said, “I will
seek the answer of the question you ask, Herbor, and I will ask no
price. But bethink you, there is always a price. The asker pays what he
has to pay.” ,</p>
<p>Then Herbor set Odren’s hands against his own eyes in sign of
gratitude, and so the Foretelling went forward. The Foretellers gathered
and went into the darkness. Herbor went among them and asked his
question, and the question was, How long will Ashe Berosty rem ir Ipe
live? For Herbor thought thus to get the count of days or years, and so
set his love’s heart at rest with certain knowledge. Then the
Foretellers moved in the darkness and at last Odren cried in great pain,
as if he burned in a fire, Longer than Herbor of Geganner!</p>
<p>It was not the answer Herbor had hoped, but it was the answer he got,
and having a patient heart he went home to Charuthe with it, through the
snows of Grende. He came into the Domain and into the strong-place and
climbed the tower, and there found his kemmering Berosty sitting as ever
blank and bleak by an ash-smothered fire, his arms lying on a table of
red stone, his head sunk between his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Ashe,” said Herbor, “I have been to Thangering Fastness, and have
been answered by the Foretellers. I asked them how long you would live
and their answer was, Berosty will live longer than Herbor.”</p>
<p>Berosty looked up at him as slow as if the hinge in his neck had
rusted, and said, “Did you ask them when I would die, then?”</p>
<p>“I asked how long-you would live.”</p>
<p>“How long? You fool! You had a question of the Foretellers, and did
not ask them when I am to die, what day, month, year, how many days are
left to me-you asked how long? O you fool, you staring fool, longer than
you, yes, longer than you!” Berosty took up the great table of red stone
as if it had been a sheet of tin and brought it down on Herbor’s head.
Herbor fell, and the stone lay on him. Berosty stood a while demented.
Then he raised up the stone, and saw that it had crushed Herbor’s skull.
He set the stone back on its pedestal. He lay down beside the dead man
and put his arms about him, as if they were in kemmer and all was well.
So the people of Charuthe found them when they broke into the tower-room
at last. Berosty was mad thereafter and had to be kept under lock, for
he would always go looking for Herbor, who he thought was somewhere”
about the Domain. He lived a month thus, and then hanged himself, on
Odstreth, the nineteenth day of the month of Them.</p>
