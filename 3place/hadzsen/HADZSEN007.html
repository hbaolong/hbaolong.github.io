<h4 id="one-way-into-orgoreyn">6. One Way into Orgoreyn</h4>
<p>The cook, who was always at the house very early, woke me up; I sleep
sound, and he had to shake me and say in my ear, “Wake up, wake up, Lord
Estraven, there’s a runner come from the King’s House!” At last I
understood him, and confused by sleep and urgency got up in haste and
went to the door of my room, where the messenger waited, and so I
entered stark naked and stupid as a newborn child into my exile.</p>
<p>Reading the paper the runner gave me I said in my mind that I had
looked for this, though not so soon. But when I must watch the man nail
that damned paper on the door of the house, then I felt as if he might
as well be driving the nails into my eyes, and I turned from him and
stood blank and bereft, undone with pain, which I had not looked
for.</p>
<p>That fit past, I saw to what must be done, and by Ninth Hour striking
on the gongs was gone from the Palace. There was nothing to keep me
long. I took what I could take. As for properties and banked monies, I
could not raise cash from them without endangering the men I dealt with,
and the better friends they were to me the worse their danger. I wrote
to my old kemmering Ashe how he might get the profit of certain valuable
things to keep for our sons’ use, but told him not to try to send me
money, for Tibe would have the border watched. I could not sign the
letter. To call anyone by telephone would be to send them to jail, and I
hurried to be gone before some friend should come in innocence to see
me, and lose his money and his freedom as a reward for his
friendship.</p>
<p>I Set off west through the city. I stopped at a street-crossing and
thought, Why should I not go east, across the mountains and the plains
back to Kerm Land, a poor man afoot, and so come home to Estre where I
was born, that stone house on a bitter mountainside: why not go home?
Three times or four I stopped thus and looked back. Each time I saw
among the indifferent street-faces one that might be the spy sent to see
me out of Erhenrang, and each time I thought of the folly of trying to
go home. As well kill myself. I was born to live in exile, it appeared,
and my one way home was by way of dying. So I went on westward and
turned back no more.</p>
<p>The three days’ grace I had would see me, given no mishap, at
farthest to Kuseben on the Gulf, eighty-five miles. Most exiles have had
a night’s warning of the Order of their Exile and so a chance to take
passage on a ship down the Sess before the shipmasters are liable to
punishment for giving aid. Such courtesy was not in Tibe’s vein. No
shipmaster would dare take me now; they all knew me at the Port, I
having built it for Argaven. No landboat would let me ride, and to the
land border from Erhenrang is four hundred miles. I had no choice but
Kuseben afoot.</p>
<p>The cook had seen that. I had sent him off at once, but leaving, he
had set out all the ready food he could find done up in a packet as fuel
for my three days’ run. That kindness saved me, and also saved my
courage, for whenever on the road I ate of that fruit and bread I
thought, “There’s one man thinks me no traitor; for he gave me
this.”</p>
<p>It is hard, I found, to be called traitor. Strange how hard it is,
for it’s an easy name to call another man; a name that sticks, that
fits, that convinces. I was half convinced myself.</p>
<p>I came to Kuseben at dusk of the third day, anxious and footsore, for
these last years in Erhenrang I had gone all to grease and luxury and
had lost my wind for walking; and there waiting for me at the gate of
the little town was Ashe.</p>
<p>Seven years we were kemmerings, and had two sons. Being of his flesh
born they had his name Foreth rem ir Osboth, and were reared in that
Clan hearth. Three years ago he had gone to Orgny Fastness and he wore
now the gold chain of a Celibate of the Foretellers. We had not seen
each other those three years, yet seeing his face in the twilight under
the arch of stone I felt the old habit of our love as if it had been
broken yesterday, and knew the faithfulness in him that had sent him to
share my ruin. And feeling that unavailing bond close on me anew, I was
angry; for Ashe’s love had always forced me to act against my heart.</p>
<p>I went on past him. If I must be cruel no need to hide it, pretending
kindness. “Therein,” he called after me, and followed. I went fast down
the steep streets of Kuseben towards the wharves. A south wind was
blowing up from the sea, rustling the black trees of the gardens, and
through that warm stormy summer dusk I hastened from him as from a
murderer. He caught up with me, for I was too footsore to keep up my
pace. He said, “Therein, I’ll go with you.”</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>“Ten years ago in this month of Tuwa we took oath-”</p>
<p>“And three years ago you broke it, leaving me, which was a wise
choice.”</p>
<p>“I never broke the vow we swore, Therein.”</p>
<p>“True. There was none to break. It was a false vow, a second vow. You
know it; you knew it then. The only true vow of faithfulness I ever
swore was not spoken, nor could it be spoken, and the man I swore it to
is dead and the promise broken, long ago. You owe me nothing, nor I you.
Let me go.”</p>
<p>As I spoke my anger and bitterness turned from Ashe against myself
and my own life, which lay behind me like a broken promise. But Ashe did
not know this, and the tears stood in his eyes. He said, “Will you take
this, Therem? I owe you nothing, but I love you well.” He held a little
packet out to me.</p>
<p>“No. I have money, Ashe. Let me go. I must go alone.” I went on, and
he did not follow me. But my brother’s shadow followed me. I had done
ill to speak of him. I had done ill in all things.</p>
<p>I found no luck waiting for me at the harbor. No ship from Orgoreyn
lay in port that I might board and so be off Karhide’s ground by
midnight, as I was bound to be. Few men were on the wharves and those
few all hurrying homeward; the one I found to speak to, a fisherman
mending the engine of his boat, looked once at me and turned his back
unspeaking. At that I was afraid. The man knew me; he would not have
known unwarned. Tibe had sent his hirelings to forestall me and keep me
in Karhide till my time ran out. I had been busy with pain and rage, but
not with fear, till now; I had not thought that the Order of Exile might
be mere pretext for my execution. Once Sixth Hour struck I was fair game
for Tibe’s men, and none could cry Murder, but only Justice done.</p>
<p>I sat down on a ballast-sack of sand there in the windy glare and
darkness of the port. The sea slapped and sucked at the pilings, and
fishing-boats jogged at their moorings, and out at the end of the long
pier burned a lamp. I sat and stared at the light and past it at
darkness over the sea. Some rise to present danger, not I. My gift is
forethought. Threatened closely I grow stupid, and sit on a bag of sand
wondering if a man could swim to Orgoreyn. The ice has been out of
Charisune Gulf for a month or two, one might stay alive a while in the
water. It is a hundred and fifty miles to the Orgota shore. I do not
know how to swim. When I looked away from the sea and back up the
streets of Kuseben I found myself looking for Ashe in hopes he still was
following me. Having come to that, shame pushed me out of stupor, and I
was able to think.</p>
<p>Bribery or violence was my choice if I dealt with that fisherman
still at work in his boat in the inner dock: a faulty engine seemed not
worth either. Theft, then. But the engines of fishing craft are locked.
To bypass the locked circuit, start the engine, steer the boat out of
dock under the pier-lamps and so off to Orgoreyn, having never run a
motorboat, seemed a silly desperate venture. I had not run a boat but
rowed one on Icefoot Lake in Kerm; and there was a rowboat tied up in
the outer dock between two launches. No sooner seen than stolen. I ran
out the pier under the staring lamps, hopped into the boat, untied the
painter, shipped the oars and rowed out onto the swelling harbor-water
where the lights slipped and dazzled on black waves. When I was pretty
well away I stopped rowing to reset the thole of one oar, for it was not
working smoothly and I had, though I hoped to be picked up next day by
an Orgota patrol Or fisherman, a good bit of rowing to do. As I bent to
the oarlock a weakness ran all through my body. I thought I would faint,
and crouched back in a heap on the thwart. It was the sickness of
cowardice overcoming me. But I had not known my cowardice lay so heavy
in my belly. I lifted my eyes and saw two figures on the pier’s end like
two jumping black twigs in the distant electric glare across the water,
and then I began to think that my paralysis was not an effect of terror,
but of a gun at extreme range.</p>
<p>I could see that one of them held a foray gun, and had it been past
midnight I suppose he would have fired it and killed me; but the foray
gun makes a loud noise and that would want explaining. So they had used
a sonic gun. At stun setting a sonic gun can locate its resonance-field
only within a hundred feet or so. I do not know its range at lethal
setting, but I had not been far out of it, for I was doubled up like a
baby with colic. I found it hard to breathe, the weakened field having
caught me in the chest. As they would soon have a powered boat out to
come finish me off, I could not spend any more time hunched over my oars
gasping. Darkness lay behind my back, before the boat, and into darkness
I must row. I rowed with weak arms, watching my hands to make sure I
kept hold of the oars, for I could not feel my grip. I came thus into
rough water and the dark, out on the open Gulf. There I had to stop.
With each oarstroke the numbness of my arms increased. My heart kept bad
time, and my lungs had forgotten how to get air. I tried to row but I
was not sure my arms were moving. I tried to pull the oars into the boat
then, but could not. When the sweeplight of a harbor patrol ship picked
me out of the night like a snowflake on soot, I could not even turn my
eyes away from the glare.</p>
<p>They unclenched my hands from the oars, hauled me up out of the boat,
and laid me out like a gutted black-fish on the deck of the patrol ship.
I felt them look down at me but could not well understand what they
said, except for one, the ship’s master by his tone; he said, “It’s not
Sixth Hour yet,” and again, answering another, “What affair of mine is
that? The king exiled him, I’ll follow the king’s order, no lesser
man’s.”</p>
<p>So against radio commands from Tibe’s men ashore and against the
arguments of his mate, who feared retribution, that officer of the
Kuseben Patrol took me across the Gulf of Charisune and set me ashore
safe in Shelt Port in Orgoreyn. Whether he did this in shifgrethor
against Tibe’s men who would kill an unarmed man, or in kindness, I do
not know. Nusuth. “The admirable is inexplicable.”</p>
<p>I got up on my feet when the Orgota coast came gray out of the
morning fog, and I made my legs move, and walked from the ship into the
waterfront streets of Shelt, but somewhere there I fell down again. When
I woke I was in the Commensal Hospital of Charisune Coastal Area Four,
Twenty-fourth Commensality, Sennethny. I made sure of this, for it was
engraved or embroidered in Orgota script on the headpiece of the bed,
the lamp-stand by the bed, the metal cup on the bedtable, the bedtable,
the nurses’ hiebs, the bedcovers and the bed-shirt I wore. A physician
came and said to me, “Why did you resist dothe?”</p>
<p>“I was not in dothe,” I said, “I was in a sonic field.”</p>
<p>“Your symptoms were those of a person who has resisted the relaxation
phase of dothe.” He was a domineering old physician, and made me admit
at last that I might have used dothe-strength to counter the paralysis
while I rowed, not clearly knowing that I did so; then this morning,
during the thangen phase when one must keep still, I had got up and
walked and so near killed myself. When all that was settled to his
satisfaction he told me I could leave in a day or two, and went on to
the next bed. Behind him came the Inspector.</p>
<p>Behind every man in Orgoreyn comes the Inspector.</p>
<p>“Name?” _</p>
<p>I did not ask him his. I must learn to live without shadows as they
do in Orgoreyn; not to take offense; not to offend uselessly. But I did
not give him my land-name, which is no business of any man in
Orgoreyn.</p>
<p>“Therein Harth? That is not an Orgota name. What Commensality?”</p>
<p>“Karhide.”</p>
<p>“That is not a Commensality of Orgoreyn. Where are your papers of
entry and identification?”</p>
<p>Where were my papers?</p>
<p>I had been considerably rolled about in the streets of Shelt before
someone had me carted off to the hospital, where I had arrived without
papers, belongings, coat, shoes, or cash. When I heard this I let go of
anger and laughed; at the pit’s bottom is no anger. The Inspector was
offended by my laughter. “Do you not understand that you are an indigent
and unregistered alien? How do you intend to return to Karhide?”</p>
<p>“By coffin.”</p>
<p>“You are not to give inappropriate answers to official questions. If
you have no intention to return to your own country you will be sent to
the Voluntary Farm, where there is a place for criminal riffraff,
aliens, and unregistered persons. There is no other place for indigents
and subversives in Orgoreyn. You had better declare your intention to
return to Karhide within three days, or I shall be-”</p>
<p>“I’m proscribed from Karhide.”</p>
<p>The physician, who had turned around from the next bed at the sound
of my name, drew the Inspector aside and muttered at him a while. The
Inspector got to looking sour as bad beer, and when he came back to me
he said, taking long to say it and grudging me each word, “Then I assume
you will declare your intention to me to enter application for
permission to obtain permanent residence in the Great Commensality of
Orgoreyn pending your obtaining and retaining useful employment as a
digit of a Commensality or Township?”</p>
<p>I said, “Yes.” The joke was gone out of it with that word permanent,
a skull-word if there ever was one.</p>
<p>After five days I was granted permanent residence pending my registry
as a digit in the Township of Mishnory (which I had requested), and was
issued temporary papers of identification for the journey to that city.
I would have been hungry those five days, if the old physician had not
kept me in the hospital. He liked having a Prime Minister of Karhide in
his ward, and the Prime Minister was grateful.</p>
<p>I worked my way to Mishnory as a landboat loader on a fresh-fish
caravan from Shelt. A fast smelly trip, ending in the great Markets of
South Mishnory, where I soon found work in the ice-houses. There is
always work in such places in summer, with the loading and packing and
storing and shipping of perishable stuff. I handled mostly fish, and
lodged in an island by the Markets with my fellows from the ice-house;
Fish Island they called it; it stank of us. But I liked the job for
keeping me most of the day in the refrigerated warehouse. Mishnory in
summer is a steam-bath. The doors of the hills are shut; the river
boils; men sweat. In the month of Ockre there were ten days and nights
when the temperature never went below sixty degrees, and one day the
heat rose to 88°. Driven out into that smelting-furnace from my cold
fishy refuge at day’s end, I would walk a couple of miles to the
Kunderer Embankment, where there are trees and one may see the great
river, though not get down to it. There I would roam late and go back at
last to Fish Island through the fierce, close night. In my part of
Mishnory they broke the streetlamps, to keep their doings in the dark.
But the Inspectors’ cars were forever snooping and spotlighting those
dark streets, taking from poor men their one privacy, the night.</p>
<p>The new Alien Registry Law enacted in the month of Kus as a move in
the shadow-fight with Karhide invalidated my registration and lost me my
job, and I spent a halfmonth waiting in the anterooms of infinite
Inspectors. My mates at work lent me money and stole fish for my dinner,
so that I got re-registered before I starved; but I had heard the
lesson. I liked those hard loyal men, but they lived in a trap there was
no getting out of, and I had work to do among people I liked less. I
made the calls I had put off for three months.</p>
<p>Next day I was washing out my shirt in the wash-house in the
courtyard of Fish Island along with several others, all of us naked or
half naked, when through the steam and stink of grime and fish and the
clatter of water I heard someone call me by my land-name: and there was
Commensal Yegey in the wash-house, looking just as he had looked at the
Reception of the Archipelagan Ambassador in the Ceremonial Hall of the
Palace in Erhenrang seven months before. “Come along out of this,
Estraven,” he said in the high, loud, nasal voice of the Mishnory rich.
“Oh, leave the damned shirt.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t got another.”</p>
<p>“Fish it out of that soup then and come on. It’s hot in here.”</p>
<p>The others stared at him with dour curiosity, knowing him a rich man,
but they did not know him for a Commensal. I did not like his being
there; he should have sent someone after me. Very few Orgota have any
feeling for decency. I wanted to get him out of there. The shirt was no
good to me wet, so I told a hearthless lad that hung about the courtyard
to keep it on his back for me till I returned. My debts and rent were
paid and my papers in my hieb-pocket; shirtless I left the island in the
Markets, and went with Yegey back among the houses of the powerful.</p>
<p>As his “secretary” I was again re-registered in the rolls of
Orgoreyn, not as a digit but as a dependent. Names won’t do, they must
have labels, and say the kind before they can see the thing. But this
time their label fit, I was dependent, and soon was brought to curse the
purpose that brought me here to eat another man’s bread. For they gave
me no sign for a month yet that I was any nearer achieving that purpose
than I had been at Fish Island.</p>
<p>On the rainy evening of the last day of summer Yegey sent for me to
his study, where I found him talking with the Commensal of the Sekeve
District, Obsle, whom I had known when he headed the Orgota Naval Trade
Commission in Erhenrang. Short and swaybacked, with little triangular
eyes in a fat, flat face, he was an odd match with Yegey, all delicacy
and bone. The frump and the fop, they looked, but they were something
more than that. They were two of the Thirty-Three who rule Orgoreyn; yet
again, they were something more than that.</p>
<p>Politenesses exchanged and a dram of Sithish lifewater drunk, Obsle
sighed and said to me, “Now tell me why you did what you did in
Sassinoth, Estraven, for if there was ever a man I thought unable to err
in the timing of an act or the weighing of shifgrethor, that man was
you.”</p>
<p>“Fear outweighed caution in me, Commensal.”</p>
<p>“Fear of what the devil? What are you afraid of, Estraven?”</p>
<p>“Of what’s happening now. The continuation of the prestige-struggle
in the Sinoth Valley; the humiliation of Karhide, the anger that rises
from humiliation; the use of that anger by the Karhidish
Government.”</p>
<p>“Use? To what end?”</p>
<p>Obsle has no manners; Yegey, delicate and prickly, broke in,
“Commensal, Lord Estraven is my guest and need not suffer
questioning-”</p>
<p>“Lord Estraven will answer questions when and as he sees fit, as he
ever did,” said Obsle grinning, a needle hidden in a heap of grease. “He
knows himself between friends, here.”</p>
<p>“I take my friends where I find them, Commensal, but I no longer look
to keep them long.”</p>
<p>“I can see that. Yet we can pull a sledge together without being
kemmerings, as we say in Eskeve-eh? What the devil, I know what you were
exiled for, my dear: for liking Karhide better than its king.”</p>
<p>“Rather for liking the king better than his cousin, perhaps.”</p>
<p>“Or for liking Karhide better than Orgoreyn,” said Yegey. “Am I
wrong, Lord Estraven?”</p>
<p>“No, Commensal.”</p>
<p>“You think, then,” said Obsle, “that Tibe wants to run Karhide as we
run Orgoreyn - efficiently?”</p>
<p>“I do. I think that Tibe, using the Sinoth Valley dispute as a goad,
and sharpening it at need, may within a year work a greater change in
Karhide than the last thousand years have seen. He has a model to work
from, the Sarf. And he knows how to play on Argaven’s fears. That’s
easier than trying to arouse Argaven’s courage, as I did. If Tibe
succeeds, you gentlemen will find you have an enemy worthy of you.”</p>
<p>Obsle nodded. “I waive shifgrethor,” said Yegey, “what are you
getting at, Estraven?”</p>
<p>“This: Will the Great Continent hold two Orgoreyns?”</p>
<p>“Aye, aye, aye, the same thought,” said Obsle, “the same thought: you
planted it in my head a long time ago, Estraven, and I never can uproot
it. Our shadow grows too long. It will cover Karhide too. A feud between
two Clans, yes; a foray between two towns, yes; a border-dispute and a
few barn-burnings and murders, yes; but a feud between two nations? a
foray involving fifty million souls? O by Meshe’s sweet milk, that’s a
picture that has set fire to my sleep, some nights, and made me get up
sweating. . , . We are not safe, we are not safe. You know it, Yegey;
you’ve said it in your own way, many times.”</p>
<p>“I’ve voted thirteen times now against pressing the Sinoth Valley
dispute. But what good? The Domination faction holds twenty votes ready
at command, and every move of Tibe’s strengthens the Sarf’s control over
those twenty. He builds a fence across the valley, puts guards along the
fence armed with foray guns-foray guns! I thought they kept them in
museums. He feeds the Domination faction a challenge whenever they need
one.”</p>
<p>“And so strengthens Orgoreyn. But also Karhide. Every response you
make to his provocations, every humiliation you inflict upon Karhide,
every gain in your prestige, will serve to make Karhide stronger, until
it is your equal-controlled all from one center as Orgoreyn is. And in
Karhide they don’t keep foray guns in museums. The King’s Guard carry
them.”</p>
<p>Yegey poured out another dram around of lifewater. Orgota noblemen
drink that precious fire, brought five thousand miles over the foggy
seas from Sith, as if it were beer. Obsle wiped his mouth and blinked
his eyes.</p>
<p>“Well,” he said, “all that is much as I thought, and much as I think.
And I think we have a sledge to pull together. But I have a question
before we get in harness, Estraven. You have my hood down over my eyes
entirely. Now tell me: what was all this obscuration, obfuscation and
fiddle-faddle concerning an Envoy from the far side of the moon?”</p>
<p>Genly Ai, then, had requested permission to enter Orgoreyn.</p>
<p>“The Envoy? He is what he says he is.”</p>
<p>“And that is-”</p>
<p>“An envoy from another world.”</p>
<p>“None of your damned shadowy Karhidish metaphors, now, Estraven. I
waive shifgrethor, I discard it. Will you answer me?”</p>
<p>“I have done so.”</p>
<p>“He is an alien being?” Obsle said, and Yegey, “And he has had
audience with King Argaven?”</p>
<p>I answered yes to both. They were silent a minute and then both
started to speak at once, neither trying to mask his interest. Yegey was
for circumambulating, but Obsle went to the point. “What was he in your
plans, then? You staked yourself on him, it seems, and fell. Why?”</p>
<p>“Because Tibe tripped me. I had my eyes on the stars, and didn’t
watch the mud I walked in.”</p>
<p>“You’ve taken up astronomy, my dear?”</p>
<p>“We’d better all take up astronomy, Obsle.”</p>
<p>“Is he a threat to us, this Envoy?”</p>
<p>“I think not. He brings from his people offers of communication,
trade, treaty, and alliance, nothing else. He came alone, without arms
or defense, with nothing but a communicating device, and his ship, which
he allowed us to examine completely. He is not to be feared, I think.
Yet he brings the end of Kingdom and Commensalities with him in his
empty hands.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“How shall we deal with strangers, except as brothers? How shall
Gethen treat with a union of eighty worlds, except as a world?”</p>
<p>“Eighty worlds?” said Yegey, and laughed uneasily. Obsle stared at me
athwart and said, “I’d like to think that you’ve been too long with the
madman in his palace and had gone mad yourself. . . . Name of Meshe!
What’s this babble of alliances with the suns and treaties with the
moon? How did the fellow come here, riding on a comet? astride a meteor?
A ship, what sort of ship floats on air? On void space? Yet you’re no
madder than you ever were, Estraven, which is to say shrewdly mad,
wisely mad. All Karhiders are insane. Lead on, my lord, I follow. Go
on!”</p>
<p>“I go nowhere, Obsle. Where have I to go? You, however, may get
somewhere. If you should follow the Envoy a little way, he might show
you a way out of the Sinoth Valley, out of the evil course we’re caught
in.”</p>
<p>“Very good. I’ll take up astronomy in my old age. Where will it lead
me?”</p>
<p>“Toward greatness, if you go more wisely than I went. Gentlemen, I’ve
been with the Envoy, I’ve seen his ship that crossed the void, and I
know that he is truly and exactly a messenger from elsewhere than this
earth. As to the honesty of his message and the truth of his
descriptions of that elsewhere, there is no knowing; one can only judge
as one would judge any man; if he were one of us I should call him an
honest man. That you’ll judge for yourselves, perhaps. But this is
certain: in his presence, lines drawn on the earth make no boundaries,
and no defense. There is a greater challenger than Karhide at the doors
of Orgoreyn. The men who meet that challenge, who first open the doors
of earth, will be the leaders of us all. All: the Three Continents: all
the .earth. Our border now is no line between two hills, but the line
our planet makes in circling the Sun. To stake shifgrethor on any lesser
chance is a fool’s doing, now.”</p>
<p>I had Yegey, but Obsle sat sunk in his fat, watching me from his
small eyes. “This will take a month’s believing,” he said. “And if it
came from anyone’s mouth but yours, Estraven, I’d believe it to be pure
hoax, a net for our pride woven out of starshine. But I know your stiff
neck. Too stiff to stoop to an assumed disgrace in order to fool us. I
can’t believe you’re speaking truth and yet I know a lie would choke
you. . . . Well, well. Will he speak to us, as it seems he spoke to
you?”</p>
<p>“That’s what he seeks: to speak, to be heard. There or here. Tibe
will silence him if he tries to be heard again in Karhide. I am afraid
for him, he seems not to understand his danger.”</p>
<p>“Will you tell us what you know?”</p>
<p>“I will; but is there a reason why he can’t come here and tell you
himself?”</p>
<p>Yegey said, biting his fingernail delicately, “I think not. He has
requested permission to enter the Commensality. Karhide makes no
objection. His request is under consideration. . . .”</p>
