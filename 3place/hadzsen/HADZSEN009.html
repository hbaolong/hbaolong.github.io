<h4 id="another-way-into-orgoreyn">8. Another Way into Orgoreyn</h4>
<p>I spent the summer more as an Investigator than a Mobile, going about
the land of Karhide from town to town, from Domain to Domain, watching
and listening-things a Mobile cannot do at first, while he is still a
marvel and monstrosity, and must be forever on show and ready to
perform. I would tell my hosts in those rural Hearths and villages who I
was; most of them had heard a little about me over the radio and had a
vague idea what I was. They were curious, some more, some less. Few were
frightened of me personally, or showed the xenophobic revulsion. An
enemy, in Karhide, is not a stranger, an invader. The stranger who comes
unknown is a guest. Your enemy is your neighbor.</p>
<p>During the month of Kus I lived on the Eastern coast in a Clan-Hearth
called Gorinhering, a house-town-fort-farm built up on a hill above the
eternal fogs of the Hodomin Ocean. Some five hundred people lived there.
Four thousand years ago I should have found their ancestors living in
the same place, in the same kind of house. Along in those four millennia
the electric engine was developed, radios and power looms and power
vehicles and farm machinery and all the rest began to be used, and a
Machine Age got going, gradually, without any industrial revolution,
without any revolution at all. Winter hasn’t achieved in thirty
centuries what Terra once achieved in thirty decades. Neither has Winter
ever paid the price that Terra paid.</p>
<p>Winter is an inimical world; its punishment for doing things wrong is
sure and prompt: death from cold or death from hunger. No margin, no
reprieve. A man can trust his luck, but a society can’t; and cultural
change, like random mutation, may make things chancier. So they have
gone very slowly. At any one point in their history a hasty observer
would say that all technological progress and diffusion had ceased. Yet
it never has. Compare the torrent and the glacier. Both get where they
are going.</p>
<p>I talked a lot with the old people of Gorinhering, and also with the
children. It was my first chance to see much of Gethenian children, for
in Erhenrang they are all in the private or public Hearths and Schools.
A quarter to a third of the adult urban population is engaged full time
in the nurture and education of the children. Here the clan looked after
its own; nobody and everybody was responsible for them. They were a wild
lot, chasing about over those fog-hidden hills and beaches. When I could
round one up long enough to talk, I found them shy, proud, and immensely
trustful.</p>
<p>The parental instinct varies as widely on Gethen as anywhere. One
can’t generalize. I never saw a Karhider hit a child. I have seen one
speak very angrily to a child. Their tenderness toward their children
struck me as being profound, effective, and almost wholly unpossessive.
Only in that unpossessiveness does it perhaps differ from what we call
the “maternal” instinct. I suspect that the distinction between a
maternal and a paternal instinct is scarcely worth making; the parental
instinct, the wish to protect, to further, is not a sex-linked
characteristic. . ..</p>
<p>Early in Hakanna we heard in Gorinhering on the static-fuzzed Palace
Bulletin that King Argaven had announced his expectation of an heir. Not
another kemmering-son, of which he already had seven, but an heir of the
body, king-son. The king was pregnant.</p>
<p>I found this funny, and so did the clansmen of Gorinhering, but for
different reasons. They said he was too old to be bearing children, and
they got hilarious and obscene on the subject. The old men went about
cackling over it for days. They laughed at the king, but were not
otherwise much interested in him. “The Domains are Karhide,” Estraven
had said, and like so much Estraven had said it kept recurring to me as
I learned more. The seeming nation, unified for centuries, was a stew of
uncoordinated principalities, towns, villages, “pseudo-feudal tribal
economic units,” a sprawl and splatter of vigorous, competent,
quarrelsome individualities over which a grid of authority was
insecurely and lightly laid. Nothing, I thought, could ever unite
Karhide as a nation. Total diffusion of rapid communication devices,
which is supposed to bring about nationalism almost inevitably, had not
done so. The Ekumen could not appeal to these people as a social unit, a
mobilizable entity: rather it must speak to their strong though
undeveloped sense of humanity, of human unity. I got quite excited
thinking about this. I was, of course, wrong; yet I had learned
something about Gethenians which in the long run proved to be useful
knowledge.</p>
<p>Unless I was to spend all year in Old Karhide I must return to the
West Fall before the passes of the Kargav closed. Even here on the coast
there had been two light snowfalls in the last month of summer. Rather
reluctantly I set off west again, and came to Erhenrang early in Gor,
the first month of autumn. Argaven was now in seclusion in the
summer-palace at Warrever, and had named Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe as
Regent during his confinement. Tibe was already making the most of his
term of power. Within a couple of hours of my arrival I began to see the
flaw in my analysis of Karhide - it was already out of date-and also
began to feel uncomfortable, perhaps unsafe, in Erhenrang.</p>
<p>Argaven was not sane; the sinister incoherence of his mind darkened
the mood of his capital; he fed on fear. All the good of his reign had
been done by his ministers and the kyorremy. But he had not done much
harm. His wrestles with his own nightmares had not damaged the kingdom.
His cousin Tibe was another kind of fish, for his insanity had logic.
Tibe knew when to act, and how to act. Only he did not know when to
stop.</p>
<p>Tibe spoke on the radio a good deal. Estraven when in power had never
done so, and it was not in the Karhidish vein: their government was not
a public performance, normally; it was covert and indirect. Tibe,
however, orated. Hearing his voice on the air I saw again the
long-toothed smile and the face masked with a net of fine wrinkles. His
speeches were long and loud: praises of Karhide, disparagements of
Orgoreyn, vilifications of “disloyal factions,” discussions of the
“integrity of the Kingdom’s borders,” lectures in history and ethics and
economics, all in a ranting, canting, emotional tone that went shrill
with vituperation or adulation. He talked much about pride of country
and love of the parent-land, but little about shifgrethor, personal
pride or prestige. Had Karhide lost so much prestige in the Sinoth
Valley business that the subject could not be brought up? No; for he
often talked about the Sinoth Valley. I decided that he was deliberately
avoiding talk of shifgrethor because he wished to rouse emotions of a
more elemental, uncontrollable kind. He wanted to stir up something
which the whole shifgrethor-pattern was a refinement upon, a sublimation
of. He wanted his hearers to be frightened and angry. His themes were
not pride and love at all, though he used the words perpetually; as he
used them they meant self-praise and hate. He talked a great deal about
Truth also, for he was, he said, “cutting down beneath the veneer of
civilization.”</p>
<p>It is a durable, ubiquitous, specious metaphor, that one about veneer
(or paint, or pliofilm, or whatever) hiding the nobler reality beneath.
It can conceal a dozen fallacies at once. One of the most dangerous is
the implication that civilization, being artificial, is unnatural: that
it is the opposite of primitiveness. … Of course there is no veneer, the
process is one of growth, and primitiveness and civilization are degrees
of the same thing. If civilization has an opposite, it is war. Of those
two things, you have either one, or the other. Not both. It seemed to me
as I listened to Tibe’s dull fierce speeches that what he sought to do
by fear and by persuasion was to force his people to change a choice
they had made before their history began, the choice between those
opposites.</p>
<p>The time was ripe, perhaps. Slow as their material and technological
advance had been, little as they valued “progress” in itself, they had
finally, in the last five or ten or fifteen centuries, got a little
ahead of Nature. They weren’t absolutely at the mercy of their merciless
climate any longer; a bad harvest would not starve a whole province, or
a bad winter isolate every city. On this basis of material stability
Orgoreyn had gradually built up a unified and increasingly efficient
centralized state. Now Karhide was to pull herself together and do the
same; and the way to make her do it was not by sparking her pride, or
building up her trade, or improving her roads, farms, colleges, and so
on; none of that; that’s all civilization, veneer, and Tibe dismissed it
with scorn. He was after something surer, the sure, quick, and lasting
way to make people into a nation: war. His ideas concerning it could not
have been too precise, but they were quite sound. The only other means
of mobilizing people rapidly and entirely is with a new religion; none
was handy; he would make do with war.</p>
<p>I sent the Regent a note in which I quoted to him the question I had
put to the Foretellers of Otherhord and the answer I had got. Tibe made
no response. I then went to the Orgota Embassy and requested permission
to enter Orgoreyn.</p>
<p>There are fewer people running the offices of the Stabiles of the
Ekumen on Hain than there were running that embassy of one small country
to another, and all of them were armed with yards of soundtapes and
records. They were slow, they were thorough; none of the slapdash
arrogance and sudden deviousness that marked Karhidish officialdom.- I
waited, while they filled out their forms.</p>
<p>The waiting got rather uneasy. The number of Palace Guards and city
police on the streets of Erhenrang seemed to multiply every day; they
were armed, and they were even developing a sort of uniform. The mood of
the city was bleak, although business was good, prosperity general, and
the weather fair. Nobody wanted much to do with me. My “landlady” no
longer showed people my room, but rather complained about being badgered
by “people from the Palace,” and treated me less as an honored sideshow
than as a political suspect. Tibe made a speech about a foray in the
Sinoth Valley: “brave Karhidish farmers, true patriots,” had dashed
across the border south of Sassinoth, had attacked an Orgota village,
burned it, and killed nine villagers, and then dragging the bodies back
had dumped them into the Ey River, “such a grave,” said the Regent, “as
all the enemies of our nation will find!” I heard this broadcast in the
eating-hall of my island. Some people looked grim as they listened,
others uninterested, others satisfied, but in these various expressions
there was one common element, a little tic or facial cramp that had not
used to be there, a look of anxiety.</p>
<p>That evening a man came to my room, my first visitor since I had
returned to Erhenrang. He was slight, smooth-skinned, shy-mannered, and
wore the gold chain of a Foreteller, one of the Celibates. “I’m a friend
of one who befriended you,” he said, with the brusqueness of the timid,
“I’ve come to ask you a favor, for his sake.”</p>
<p>“You mean Faxe-?”</p>
<p>“No. Estraven.”</p>
<p>My helpful expression must have changed. There was a little pause,
after which the stranger said, “Estraven, the traitor. You remember him,
perhaps?”</p>
<p>Anger had displaced timidity, and he was going to play shifgrethor
with me. If I wanted to play, my move was to say something like, “I’m
not sure; tell me something about him.” But I didn’t want to play, and
was used to volcanic Karhidish tempers by now. I faced his anger
deprecatingly and said, “Of course I do.”</p>
<p>“But not with friendship.” His dark, down-slanted eyes were direct
and keen.</p>
<p>“Well, rather with gratitude, and disappointment. Did he send you to
me?”</p>
<p>“He did not.”</p>
<p>I waited for him to explain himself.</p>
<p>He said, “Excuse me. I presumed; I accept what presumption has earned
me.”</p>
<p>I stopped the stiff little fellow as he made for the door. “Please: I
don’t know who you are, or what you want. I haven’t refused, I simply
haven’t consented. You must allow me the right to a reasonable caution.
Estraven was exiled for supporting my mission here-”</p>
<p>“Do you consider yourself to be in his debt for that?”</p>
<p>“Well, in a sense. However, the mission I am on overrides all
personal debts and loyalties.”</p>
<p>“If so,” said the stranger with fierce certainty, “it is an immoral
mission.”</p>
<p>That stopped me. He sounded like an Advocate of the Ekumen, and I had
no answer. “I don’t think it is,” I said finally; “the shortcomings are
in the messenger, not the message. But please tell me what it is you
want me to do.”</p>
<p>“I have certain monies, rents and debts, which I was able to collect
from the wreck of my friend’s fortune. Hearing that you were about to go
to Orgoreyn, I thought to ask you to take the money to him, if you find
him. As you know, it would be a punishable offense to do so. It may also
be useless. He may be in Mishnory, or on one of their damnable Farms, or
dead. I have no way of finding out. I have no friends in Orgoreyn, and
none here I dared ask this of. I thought of you as one above politics,
free to come and go. I did not stop to think that you have, of course,
your own politics. I apologize for my stupidity.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll take the money for him. But if he’s dead or can’t be
found, to whom shall I return it?”</p>
<p>He stared at me. His face worked and changed, and he caught his
breath in a sob. Most Karhiders cry easily, being no more ashamed of
tears than of laughter. He said, “Thank you. My name is Foreth. I’m an
Indweller at Orgny Fastness.”</p>
<p>“You’re of Estraven’s clan?”</p>
<p>“No. Foreth rem ir Osboth: I was his kemmering.”</p>
<p>Estraven had had no kemmering when I knew him, but I could rouse no
suspicion of this fellow in myself. He might be unwittingly serving
someone else’s purpose, but he was genuine. And he had just taught me a
lesson: that shifgrethor can be played on the level of ethics, and that
the expert player will win. He had cornered me in about two moves. -He
had the money with him and gave it to me, a solid sum in Royal Karhidish
Merchants’ notes of credit, nothing to incriminate me, and consequently
nothing to prevent me from simply spending it.</p>
<p>“If you find him …” He stuck.</p>
<p>“A message?”</p>
<p>“No. Only if I knew …”</p>
<p>“If I do find him, I’ll try to send news of him to you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you,” he said, and he held out both his hands to me, a gesture
of friendship which in Karhide is not lightly made. “I wish success to
your mission, Mr. Ai. He - Estraven - he believed you came here to do
good, I know. He believed it very strongly.”</p>
<p>There was nothing in the world for this man outside Estraven. He was
one of those who are damned to love once. I said again, “Is there no
word from you that I might take him?”</p>
<p>“Tell him the children are well,” he said, then hesitated, and said
quietly,”Nusuth, no matter,” and left me.</p>
<p>Two days later I took the road out of Erhenrang, the northwest road
this time, afoot. My permission to enter Orgoreyn had arrived much
sooner than the clerks and officials of the Orgota Embassy had led me to
expect or had themselves expected; when I went to get the papers they
treated me with a sort of poisonous respect, resentful that protocol and
regulations had, on somebody’s authority, been pushed aside for me. As
Karhide had no regulations at all about leaving the country, I set
straight off. Over the summer I had learned what a pleasant land Karhide
was for walking in. Roads and inns are set for foot-traffic as well as
for powered vehicles, and where inns are wanting one may count
infallibly on the code of hospitality. Townsfolk of Co-Domains and the
villagers, farmers, or lord of any Domain will give a traveler food and
lodging, for three days by the code, and in practice for much longer
than that; and what’s best is that you are always received without fuss,
welcomed, as if they had been expecting you to come.</p>
<p>I meandered across the splendid slanting land between the Sess and
the Ey, taking my time, working out my keep a couple of mornings in the
fields of the great Domains, where they were getting the harvest in,
every hand and tool and machine at work to get the golden fields cut
before the weather turned. It was all golden, all benign, that week of
walking; and at night before I slept I would step out of the dark
farmhouse or firelit Hearth-Hall where I was lodged and walk a way into
the dry stubble to look up at the stars, flaring like far cities in the
windy autumn dark.</p>
<p>In fact I was reluctant to leave this land, which I had found, though
so indifferent to the Envoy, so gentle to the stranger. I dreaded
starting all over, trying to repeat my news in a new language to new
hearers, failing again perhaps. I wandered more north than west,
justifying my course by a curiosity to see the Sinoth Valley region, the
locus of the rivalry between Karhide and Orgoreyn. Though the weather
held clear it began to grow colder, and at last I turned west before I
got to Sassinoth, remembering that there was a fence across that stretch
of border, and I might not be so easily let out of Karhide there. Here
the border was the Ey, a narrow river but fierce, glacier-fed like all
rivers of the Great Continent. I doubled back a few miles south to find
a bridge, and came on one linking two little villages, Passerer on the
Karhide side and Siuwensin in Orgoreyn, staring sleepily at each other
across the noisy Ey.</p>
<p>The Karhidish bridge-keeper asked me only if I planned to return that
night, and waved me on across. On the Orgota side an Inspector was
called out to inspect my passport and papers, which he did for about an
hour, a Karhidish hour at that. He kept the passport, telling me I must
call for it next morning, and gave me in place of it a permiso for meals
and lodging at the Commensal Transient-House of Siuwensin. I spent
another hour in the office of the superintendent of the Transient-House,
while the superintendent read my papers and checked on the authenticity
of my permiso by telephoning the Inspector at the Commensal
Border-Station from which I had just come.</p>
<p>I can’t properly define that Orgota word here translated as
“commensal,”</p>
<p>“commensality.” Its root is a word meaning “to eat together.” Its
usage includes all national/ governmental institutions of Orgoreyn, from
the State as a whole through its thirty-three component substates or
Districts to the sub-substates, townships, communal farms, mines,
factories, and so on, that compose these. As an adjective it is applied
to all the above; in the form “the Commensals” it usually means the
thirty-three Heads of Districts, who form the governing body, executive
and legislative, of the Great Commensality of Orgoreyn, but it may also
mean the citizens, the people themselves. In this curious lack of
distinction between the general and specific applications of the word,
in the use of it for both the whole and the part, the state and the
individual, in this imprecision is its precisest meaning.</p>
<p>My papers and my presence were at last approved, and by Fourth Hour I
got my first meal since early breakfast-supper: kadik-porridge and cold
sliced bread-apple. For all its array of officials, Siuwensin was a very
small, plain place, sunk deep in rural torpor. The Commensal
Transient-House was shorter than its name. Its dining-room had one
table, five chairs, and no fire; food was brought in from the village
hot-shop. The other room was the dormitory: six beds, a lot of dust, a
little mildew. I had it to myself. As everybody in Siuwensin appeared to
have gone to bed directly after supper, I did the same. I fell asleep in
that utter country silence that makes your ears ring. I slept an hour
and woke in the grip of a nightmare about explosions, invasion, murder,
and conflagration.</p>
<p>It was a particularly bad dream, the kind in which you run down a
strange street in the dark with a lot of people who have no faces, while
houses go up in flames behind you, and children scream.</p>
<p>I ended up in an open field, standing in dry stubble by a black
hedge. The dull-red halfmoon and some stars showed through clouds
overhead. The wind was bitter cold. Near me a big barn or granary bulked
up in the dark, and in the distance beyond it I saw little volleys of
sparks going up on the wind.</p>
<p>I was bare-legged and barefoot, in my shirt, without breeches, hieb,
or coat; but I had my pack. It held not only spare clothes but also my
rubies, cash, documents, papers, and ansible, and I slept with it as a
pillow when I traveled. Evidently I hung onto it even during bad dreams.
I got out shoes and breeches and my fur lined winter hieb, and dressed,
there in the cold, dark country silence, while Siuwensin smoldered half
a mile behind me. Then I struck out looking for a road, and soon found
one, and on it, other people. They were refugees like me, but they knew
where they were going. I followed them, having no direction of my own,
except away from Siuwensin; which, I gathered as we walked, had been
raided by a foray from Passerer across the bridge.</p>
<p>They had struck, set fire, withdrawn; there had been no fight. But
all at once lights glared down the dark at us, and scuttling to the
roadside we watched a land-caravan, twenty trucks, come at top speed out
of the west toward Siuwensin and pass us with a flash of light and a
hiss of wheels twenty times repeated; then silence and the dark
again.</p>
<p>“We soon came to a communal farm-center, where we were halted and
interrogated. I tried to attach myself to the group I had followed down
the road, but no luck; no luck for them either, if they did not have
their identification-papers with them. They, and I as a foreigner
without passport, were cut out of the herd and given separate quarters
for the night in a storage-barn, a vast stone semi-cellar with one door
locked on us from outside, and no window. Now and then the door was
unlocked and a new refugee thrust in by a farm-policeman armed with the
Gethenian sonic “gun.” The door shut, it was perfectly dark: no light.
One’s eyes, cheated of sight, sent starbursts and fiery blots whirling
through the black. The air was cold, and heavy with the dust and odor of
grain. No one had a handlight; these were people who had been routed out
of their beds, like me; a couple of them were literally naked, and had
been given blankets by others on the way. They had nothing. If they had
had anything, it would have been their papers. Better to be naked than
to lack papers, in Orgoreyn.</p>
<p>They sat dispersed in that hollow, huge, dusty blindness. Sometimes
two conversed a while, low-voiced. There was no fellow feeling of being
prisoners together. There was no complaint.</p>
<p>I heard one whisper to my left: “I saw him in the street, outside my
door. His head was blown off.”</p>
<p>“They use those guns that fire pieces of metal. Foray guns.”</p>
<p>“Tiena said they weren’t from Passerer, but from Ovord Domain, come
down by truck.”</p>
<p>“But there isn’t any quarrel between Ovord and Siuwensin. …”</p>
<p>They did not understand; they did not complain. They did not protest
being locked up in a cellar by their fellow-citizens after having been
shot and burned out of their homes. They sought no reasons for what had
happened to them. The whispers in the dark, random and soft, in the
sinuous Orgota language that made Karhidishhuhuth sound like rocks
rattled in a can, ceased little by little. People slept. A baby fretted
a while, away off in the dark, crying at the echo of its own cries.</p>
<p>The door squealed open and it was broad day, sunlight like a knife in
the eyes, bright and frightening. I stumbled out behind the rest and was
mechanically following them when I heard my name. I had not recognized
it; for one thing the Orgota could say I. Someone had been calling it at
intervals ever since the door was unlocked.</p>
<p>“Please come this way, Mr. Ai,” said a hurried person in red, and I
was no longer a refugee. I was set apart from those nameless ones with
whom I had fled down a dark road and whose lack of identity I had shared
all night in a dark room. I was named, known, recognized; I existed. It
was an intense relief. I followed my leader gladly.</p>
<p>The office of the Local Commensal Farm Centrality was hectic and
upset, but they made time to look after me, and apologized to me for the
discomforts of the night past. “If only you had not chosen to enter the
Commensality at Siuwensin!” lamented one fat Inspector, “if only you had
taken the customary roads!” They did not know who I was or why I was to
be given particular treatment; their ignorance was evident, but made no
difference. Genly Ai, the Envoy, was to be treated as a distinguished
person. He was. By mid-afternoon I was on my way to Mishnory in a car
put at my disposal by the Commensal Farm Centrality of East Homsvashom,
District Eight. I had a new passport, and a free pass to all
Transient-Houses on my road, and a telegraphed invitation to the
Mishnory residence of the First Commensal District Commissioner of
Entry-Roads and Ports, Mr. Uth Shusgis.</p>
<p>The radio of the little car came on with the engine and ran while the
car did; so all afternoon as I drove through the great level grain lands
of East Orgoreyn, fenceless (for there are no herd-beasts) and full of
streams, I listened to the radio. It told me about the weather, the
crops, road-conditions; it cautioned me to drive carefully; it gave me
various kinds of news from all thirty-three Districts, the output of
various factories, the shipping-information from various sea and river
ports; it singsonged some Yomesh chants, and then told me about the
weather again. It was all very mild, after the ranting I had heard on
the radio in Erhenrang. No mention was made of the raid on Siuwensin;
the Or-gota government evidently meant to prevent, not rouse,
excitement. A brief official bulletin repeated every so often said
simply that order was being and would be maintained along the Eastern
Border. I liked that; it was reassuring and unprovocative, and had the
quiet toughness that I had always admired in Gethenians: Order will be
maintained. … I was glad, now, to be out of Karhide, an incoherent land
driven towards violence by a paranoid, pregnant king and an egomaniac
Regent. I was glad to be driving sedately at twenty-five miles an hour
through vast, straight-furrowed grain-lands, under an even gray sky,
towards a capital whose government believed in Order.</p>
<p>The road was posted frequently (unlike the signless Karhidish roads
on which you had to ask or guess your way) with directions to prepare to
stop at the Inspection-Station of such-and-such Commensal Area or
Region; at these internal customs-houses one’s identification must be
shown and one’s passage recorded. My papers were valid to all
examination, and I was politely waved on after minimal delay, and
politely advised how far it was to the next Transient-House if I wanted
to eat or sleep. At 25 mph it is a considerable journey from the North
Fall to Mishnory, and I spent two nights on the way. Food at the
Transient-Houses was dull but plentiful, lodging decent, lacking only
privacy. Even that was supplied in some measure by the reticence of my
fellow travelers. I did not strike up an acquaintance or have a real
conversation at any of these halts, though I tried several times. The
Orgota seemed not an unfriendly people, but incurious; they were
colorless, steady, subdued. I liked them. I had had two years of color,
choler, and passion in Karhide. A change was welcome.</p>
<p>Following the east bank of the great River Kunderer I came on my
third morning in Orgoreyn to Mishnory, the largest city on that
world.</p>
<p>In the weak sunlight between autumn showers it was a queer-looking
city, all blank stone walls with a few narrow windows set too high, wide
streets that dwarfed the crowds, street-lamps perched on ridiculous tall
posts, roofs pitched steep as praying hands, shed-roofs sticking out of
housewalls eighteen feet above ground like big aimless bookshelves-an
ill-proportioned, grotesque city, in the sunlight. It was not built for
sunlight. It was built for winter. In winter, with those streets filled
ten feet up with packed, hard-rolled snow, the steep roofs
icicle-fringed, sleds parked under the shed-roofs, narrow window-slits
shining yellow through driving sleet, you would see the fitness of that
city, its economy, its beauty.</p>
<p>Mishnory was cleaner, larger, lighter than Erhenrang, more open and
imposing. Great buildings of yellowish-white stone dominated it, simple
stately blocks all built to a pattern, housing the offices and services
of the Commensal Government and also the major temples of the Yomesh
cult, which is promulgated by the Commensality. There was no clutter and
contortion, no sense of always being under the shadow of something high
and gloomy, as in Erhenrang; everything was simple, grandly conceived,
and orderly. I felt as if I had come out of a dark age, and wished I had
not wasted two years in Karhide. This, now, looked like a country ready
to enter the Ekumenical Age.</p>
<p>I drove about the city a while, then returned the car to the proper
Regional Bureau and went on foot to the residence of the First Commensal
District Commissioner of Entry-Roads and Ports. I had never made quite
sure whether the invitation was a request or a polite command. Nusuth. I
was in Orgoreyn to speak for the Ekumen, and might as well begin here as
anywhere.</p>
<p>My notions of Orgota phlegm and self-control were spoiled by
Commissioner Shusgis, who advanced on me smiling and shouting, grabbed
both my hands in the gesture which Karhiders reserve for moments of
intense personal emotion, pumped my arms up and down as if trying to
start a spark in my engine, and bellowed a greeting to the Ambassador of
the Ekumen of the Known Worlds to Gethen.</p>
<p>That was a surprise, for not one of the twelve or fourteen Inspectors
who had studied my papers had shown any sign of recognizing my name or
the terms Envoy or Ekumen-all of which had been at least vaguely
familiar to all Karhiders I had met. I had decided that Karhide had
never let any broadcasts concerning me be used on Orgota stations, but
had tried to keep me a national secret.</p>
<p>“Not Ambassador, Mr. Shusgis. Only an envoy.”</p>
<p>“Future Ambassador, then. Yes, by Meshe!” Shusgis, a solid, beaming
man, looked me up and down and laughed again. “You’re not what I
expected, Mr. Ai! Nowhere near it. Tall as a street-lamp, they said,
thin as a sledge-runner, soot-black and slant-eyed-an ice-ogre I
expected, a monster! Nothing of the kind. Only you’re darker than most
of us.”</p>
<p>“Earth-colored,” I said.</p>
<p>“And you were in Siuwensin the night of the foray? By the breasts of
Meshe! what a world we live in. You might have been killed crossing the
bridge over the Ey, after crossing all space to get here. Well! Well!
You’re here. And a lot of people want to see you, and hear you, and make
you welcome to Orgoreyn at last.”</p>
<p>He installed me at once, no arguments, in an apartment of his house,
A high official and wealthy man, he lived in a style that has no
equivalent in Karhide, even among lords of great Domains. Shusgis’ house
was a whole island, housing over a hundred employees, domestic servants,
clerks, technical advisers-, and so on, but no relatives, no kinfolk.
The system of extended-family clans, of Hearths and Domains, though
still vaguely discernible in the Commensal structure, was “nationalized”
several hundred years ago in Orgoreyn. No child over a year old lives
with its parent or parents; all are brought up in the Commensal Hearths.
There is no rank by descent. Private wills are not legal: a man dying
leaves his fortune to the state. All start equal.</p>
<p>But obviously they don’t go on so. Shusgis was rich, and liberal with
his riches. There were luxuries in my rooms that I had not known existed
on Winter-for instance, a shower. There was an electric heater as well
as a well-stocked fireplace. Shusgis laughed: “They told me, keep the
Envoy warm, he’s from a hot world, an oven of a world, and can’t stand
our cold. Treat him as if he were pregnant, put furs on his bed and
heaters in his room, heat his wash-water and keep his windows shut! Will
it do? Will you be comfortable? Please tell me what else you’d like to
have here.”</p>
<p>Comfortable! Nobody in Karhide had ever asked me, under any
circumstances, if I was comfortable.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shusgis,” I said with emotion, “I feel perfectly at home.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t satisfied till he had got another pesthry-fur blanket on
the bed, and more logs into the fireplace. “I know how it is,” he said,
“when I was pregnant I couldn’t keep warm-my feet were like ice, I sat
over the fire all that winter. Long ago of course, but I remember!”
-Gethenians tend to have their children young; most* of them, after the
age of twenty-four or so, use contraceptives, and they cease to be
fertile in the female phase at about forty. Shusgis was in his fifties,
therefore his “long ago of course,”1and it certainly was difficult to
imagine him as a young mother. He was a hard shrewd jovial politician,
whose acts of kindness served his interest and whose interest was
himself. His type is pan human. I had met him on Earth, and on Hain, and
on Ollul. I expect to meet him in Hell.</p>
<p>“You’re well informed as to my looks and tastes, Mr. Shusgis. I’m
flattered; I thought my reputation hadn’t preceded me.”</p>
<p>“No,” he said, understanding me perfectly, “they’d just as soon have
kept you buried under a snowdrift, there in Erhenrang, eh? But they let
you go, they let you go; and that’s when we realized, here, that you
weren’t just another Karhidish lunatic but the real thing.”</p>
<p>“I don’t follow you, I think.”</p>
<p>“Why, Argaven and his crew were afraid of you, Mr. Ai-afraid of you
and glad to see your back. Afraid if they mishandled you, or silenced
you, there might be retribution. A foray from outer space, eh! So they
didn’t dare touch you. And they tried to hush you up. Because they’re
afraid of you and of what you bring to Gethen!”</p>
<p>It was exaggerated; I certainly hadn’t been censored out of the
Karhidish news, at least so long as Estraven was in power. But I already
had the impression that for some reason news hadn’t got around about me
much in Orgoreyn, and Shusgis confirmed my suspicions.</p>
<p>“Then you aren’t afraid of what I bring to Gethen?”</p>
<p>“No, we’re not, sir!”</p>
<p>“Sometimes I am.”</p>
<p>He chose to laugh jovially at that. I did not qualify my words. I’m
not a salesman, I’m not selling Progress to the Abos. We have to meet as
equals, with some mutual understanding and candor, before my mission can
even begin.</p>
<p>“Mr. Ai, there are a lot of people waiting to meet you, bigwigs and
little ones, and some of them are the ones you’ll be wanting to talk to
here, the people who get things done. I asked for the honor of receiving
you because I’ve got a big house and because I’m well known as a neutral
sort of fellow, not a Dominator and not an Open-Trader, just a plain
Commissioner who does his job and won’t lay you open to any talk about
whose house you’re staying in.” He laughed. “But that means you’ll be
eating out a good deal, if you don’t mind.”</p>
<p>“I’m at your disposal, Mr. Shusgis.”</p>
<p>“Then tonight it’ll be a little supper with Vanake Slose.”</p>
<p>“Commensal from Kuwera-Third District, is it?” Of course I had done
some homework before I came. He fussed over my condescension in deigning
to learn anything about his country. Manners here were certainly
different from manners in Karhide; there, the fuss he was making would
either have degraded his own Shifgrethor or insulted mine; I wasn’t sure
which, but it would have done one or the other-practically everything
did.</p>
<p>I needed clothes fit for a dinner-party, having lost my good
Erhenrang suit in the raid on Siuwensin, so that afternoon I took a
Government taxi downtown and brought myself an Orgota rig. Hieb and
shirt were much as in Karhide, but instead of summer breeches they wore
thigh-high leggings the year round, baggy and cumbrous; the colors were
loud blues or reds, and the cloth and cut and make were all a little
shoddy. It was standardized work. The clothes showed me what it was that
this impressive, massive city lacked: elegance. Elegance is a small
price to pay for enlightenment, and I was glad to pay it. I went back to
Shusgis’ house and reveled in the hot showerbath, which came at one from
all sides in a kind of prickly mist. I thought of the cold tin tubs of
East Karhide that I had chattered and shuddered in last summer, the
ice-ringed basin in my Erhenrang room. Was that elegance? Long live
comfort! I put on my gaudy red finery, and was driven with Shusgis to
the supper-party in his chauffeured private car. There are more
servants, more services in Orgoreyn than in Karhide. This is because all
Orgota are employees of the state; the state must find employment for
all citizens, and does so. This, at least, is the accepted explanation,
though like most economic explanations it seems, under certain lights,
to omit the main point.</p>
<p>Commensal Slose’s fiercely-lighted, high, white reception room held
twenty or thirty guests, three of them Commensals and all of them
evidently notables of one kind or another. This was more than a group of
Orgota curious to see “the alien.” I was not a curiosity, as I had been
for a whole year in Karhide; not a freak; not a puzzle. I was, it
seemed, a key.</p>
<p>What door was I to unlock? Some of them had a notion, these statesmen
and officials who greeted me effusively, but I had none.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t find out during supper. All over Winter, even in frozen
barbarian Perunter, it is considered execrably vulgar to talk business
while eating. As supper was served promptly I postponed my questions and
attended to a gummy fish soup and to my host and fellow guests. Slose
was a frail, youngish person, with unusually light, bright eyes and a
muted, intense voice; he looked like an idealist, a dedicated soul. I
liked his manner, but I wondered what it was he was dedicated to. On my
left sat another Commensal, a fat-faced fellow named Obsle. He was
gross, genial, and inquisitive. By the third sip of soup he was asking
me what the devil was I really born on some other world-what was it like
there-warmer than Gethen, everybody said-how warm?</p>
<p>“Well, in this same latitude on Terra, it never snows.”</p>
<p>“It never snows. It never snows?” He laughed with real enjoyment, as
a child laughs at a good lie, encouraging further flights.</p>
<p>“Our sub-arctic regions are rather like your habitable zone; we’re
farther out of our last Ice Age than you, but not out, you see.
Fundamentally Terra and Gethen are very much alike. All the inhabited
worlds are. Men can live only within a narrow range of environments;
Gethen’s at one extreme. …”</p>
<p>“Then there are worlds hotter than yours?”</p>
<p>“Most of them are warmer. Some are hot; Gde, for instance. It’s
mostly sand and rock desert. It was warm to start with, and an
exploitive civilization wrecked its natural balances fifty or sixty
thousand years ago, burned up the forests for kindling, as it were.
There are still people there, but it resembles-if I understand the Text
-the Yomesh idea of where thieves go after death.”</p>
<p>That drew a grin from Obsle, a quiet, approving grin which made me
suddenly revise my estimation of the man.</p>
<p>“Some sub-cultists hold that those Afterlife Interims are actually,
physically situated on other worlds, other planets of the real universe.
Have you met with that idea, Mr. Ai?”</p>
<p>“No; I’ve been variously described, but nobody’s yet explained me
away as a ghost.” As I spoke I chanced to look to my right, and saying
“ghost” saw one. Dark, in dark clothing, still and shadowy, he sat at my
elbow, the specter at the feast.</p>
<p>Obsle’s attention had been taken up by his other neighbor, and most
people were listening to Slose at the head of the table. I said in a low
voice, “I didn’t expect to see you here, Lord Estraven.”</p>
<p>“The unexpected is what makes life possible,” he said.</p>
<p>“I was entrusted with a message for you.”</p>
<p>He looked inquiring.</p>
<p>“It takes the form of money-some of your own- Foreth rem ir Osboth
sends it. I have it with me, at Mr. Shusgis’ house. I’ll see that it
comes to you.”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of you, Mr. Ai.</p>
<p>He was quiet, subdued, reduced-a banished man living off his wits in
a foreign land. He seemed disinclined to talk with me, and I was glad
not to talk with him. Yet now and then during that long, heavy,
talkative supper-party, though all my attention was given to those
complex and powerful Orgota who meant to befriend or use me, I was
sharply aware of him: of his silence: of his dark averted face. And it
crossed my mind, though I dismissed the idea as baseless, that I had not
come to Mishnory to eat roast blackfish with the Commensals of my own
free will; nor had they brought me here. He had.</p>
