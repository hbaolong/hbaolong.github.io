<h4 id="estraven-the-traitor">9. Estraven the Traitor</h4>
<p>An East Karhidish tale, as told in Gorinhering by Tobord Chorhawa and
recorded by G.A. The story is well known in various versions, and a
“habben” play based on it is in the repertory of traveling players east
of the Kargav.</p>
<p>Long ago, before the days of King Argaven I who made Karhide one
kingdom, there was blood feud between the Domain of Stok and the Domain
of Estre in Kerm Land. The feud had been fought in forays and ambushes
for three generations, and there was no settling it, for it was a
dispute over land. Rich land is scarce in Kerm, and a Domain’s pride is
in the length of its borders, and the lords of Kerm Land are proud men
and umbrageous men, casting black shadows.</p>
<p>It chanced that the heir of the flesh of the Lord of Estre, a young
man, skiing across Icefoot Lake in the month of Irrem hunting pesthry,
came onto rotten ice and fell into the lake. Though by using one ski as
a lever on a firmer ice-edge he pulled himself up out of the water at
last, he was in almost as bad case out of the lake as in it, for he was
drenched, the air was kurem,* and night was coming on.</p>
<p>*Kurem, damp weather, 0° to -20° F.</p>
<p>He saw no hope of reaching Estre eight miles away uphill, and so set
off towards the village of Ebos on the north shore of the lake. As night
fell the fog flowed down off the glacier and spread out all across the
lake, so that he could not see his way, nor where to set his skis.
Slowly he went for fear of rotten ice, yet in haste, because the cold
was at his bones and before long he would not be able to move. He saw at
last a light before him in the night and fog. He cast off his skis, for
the lakeshore was rough going and bare of snow in places. His legs would
not well hold him up any more, and he struggled as best he could to the
light. He was far astray from the way to Ebos. This was a small house
set by itself in a forest of the thore-trees that are all the woods of
Kerm Land, and they grew close all about the house and no taller than
its roof. He beat at the door with his hands and called aloud, and one
opened the door and brought him into firelight.</p>
<p>There was no one else there, only this one person alone. He took
Estraven’s clothes off him that were like clothes of iron with the ice,
and put him naked between furs, and with the warmth of his own body
drove out the frost from Estraven’s feet and hands, and face, and gave
him hot ale to drink. At last the young man was recovered, and looked on
the one who cared for him.</p>
<p>This was a stranger, young as himself. They looked at each other.
Each of them was comely, strong of frame and fine of feature, straight
and dark. Estraven saw that the fire of kemmer was in the face of the
other.</p>
<p>He said, “I am Arek of Estre.”</p>
<p>The other said, “I am Therem of Stok.”</p>
<p>Then Estraven laughed, for he was still weak, and said, “Did you warm
me back to life in order to kill me, Stokven?”</p>
<p>The other said, “No.”</p>
<p>He put out his hand and touched Estraven’s hand, as if he were making
certain that the frost was driven out. At the touch, though Estraven was
a day or two from his kemmer, he felt the fire waken in himself. So for
a while both held still, their hands touching.</p>
<p>“They are the same,” said Stokven, and laying his palm against
Estraven’s showed it was so: their hands were the same in length and
form, finger by finger, matching like the two hands of one man laid palm
to palm.</p>
<p>“I have never seen you before,” Stokven said. “We are mortal
enemies.” He rose, and built up the fire in the hearth, and returned to
sit by Estraven.</p>
<p>“We are mortal enemies,” said Estraven. “I would swear kemmering with
you.”</p>
<p>“And I with you,” said the other. Then they vowed kemmering to each
other, and in Kerm Land then as now that vow of faithfulness is not to
be broken, not to be replaced. That night, and the day that followed,
and the night that followed, they spent in the hut in the forest by the
frozen lake. On the next morning a party of men from Stok came to the
hut. One of them knew young Estraven by sight. He said no word and gave
no warning but drew his knife, and there in Stokven’s sight stabbed
Estraven in the throat and chest, and the young man fell across the cold
hearth in his blood, dead.</p>
<p>“He was the heir of Estre,” the murderer said.</p>
<p>Stokven said, “Put him on your sledge, and take him to Estre for
burial.”</p>
<p>He went back to Stok. The men set off with Estraven’s body on the
sledge, but they left it far in the thore-forest for wild beasts to eat,
and returned that night to Stok. Therein stood up before his parent in
the flesh, Lord Harish rem ir Stokven, and said to the men, “Did you do
as I bid you?” They answered, “Yes.” Therem said, “You lie, for you
would never have come back alive from Estre. These men have disobeyed my
command and lied to hide their disobedience: I ask their banishment.”
Lord Harish granted it, and they were driven out of hearth and law.</p>
<p>Soon after this Therem left his Domain, saying that he wished to
indwell at Rotherer Fastness for a time, and he did not return to Stok
until a year had passed.</p>
<p>Now in the Domain of Estre they sought for Arek in mountain and
plain, and then mourned for him: bitter the mourning through summer and
autumn, for he had been the lord’s one child of the flesh. But in the
end of the month Them when winter lay heavy on the land, a man came up
the mountainside on skis, and gave to the warder at Estre Gate a bundle
wrapped in furs, saying, “This is Therem, the son’s son of Estre.” Then
he was down the mountain on his skis like a rock skipping over water,
gone before any thought to hold him.</p>
<p>In the bundle of furs lay a newborn child, weeping. They brought the
child in to Lord Sorve and told him the stranger’s words; and the old
lord full of grief saw in the baby his lost son Arek. He ordered that
the child be reared as a son of the Inner Hearth, and that he be called
Therein, though that was not a name ever used by the clan of Estre.</p>
<p>The child grew comely, fine and strong; he was dark of nature and
silent, yet all saw in him some likeness to the lost Arek. When he was
grown Lord Sorve in the willfulness of old age named him heir of Estre.
Then there were swollen hearts among Sorve’s kemmering-sons, all strong
men in their prime, who had waited long for lordship. They laid ambush
against young Therein when he went out alone hunting pesthry in the
month of Irrem. But he was armed, and not taken unawares. Two of his
hearth-brothers he shot, in the fog that lay thick on Icefoot Lake in
the thaw-weather, and a third he fought with, knife to knife, and killed
at last, though he himself was wounded on the chest and neck with deep
cuts. Then he stood above his brother’s body in the mist over the ice,
and saw that night was falling. He grew sick and weak as the blood ran
from his wounds, and he thought to go to Ebos village for help; but in
the gathering dark he went astray, and came to the thore-forest on the
east shore of the lake. There seeing an abandoned hut he entered it, and
too faint to light a fire he fell down on the cold stones of die hearth,
and lay so with his wounds unstaunched.</p>
<p>One came in out of the night, a man alone. He stopped in the doorway
and was still, staring at the man who lay in his blood across the
hearth. Then he entered in haste, and made a bed of furs that he took
out of an old chest, and built up a fire, and cleaned Therem’s wounds
and bound them. When he saw the young man look at him he said, “I am
Therem of Stok.”</p>
<p>“I am Therem of Estre.”</p>
<p>There was silence a while between them. Then the young man smiled and
said, “Did you bind up my wounds in order to kill me, Stokven?”</p>
<p>“No,” said the older one.</p>
<p>Estraven asked, “How does it chance that you, the Lord of Stok, are
here on disputed land alone?”</p>
<p>“I come here often,” Stokven replied.</p>
<p>He felt the young man’s pulse and hand for fever, and for an instant
laid his palm flat to Estraven’s palm; and finger by finger their two
hands matched, like the two hands of one man.</p>
<p>“We are mortal enemies,” said Stokven.</p>
<p>Estraven answered, “We are mortal enemies. Yet I have never seen you
before.”</p>
<p>Stokven turned aside his face. “Once I saw you, long ago,” he said.
“I wish there might be peace between our houses.”</p>
<p>Estraven said, “I will vow peace with you.”</p>
<p>So they made that vow, and then spoke no more, and the hurt man
slept. In the morning Stokven was gone, but a party of people from Ebos
village came to the hut and carried Estraven home to Estre. There none
dared longer oppose the old lord’s will, the Tightness of which was
written plain in three men’s blood on the lake-ice; and at Sorve’s death
Therem became Lord of Estre. Within the year he ended the old feud,
giving up half the disputed lands to the Domain of Stok. For this, and
for the murder of his hearth-brothers, he was called Estraven the
Traitor. Yet his name, Therem, is still given to children of that
Domain.</p>
