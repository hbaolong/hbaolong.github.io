<h4 id="the-mad-king">3. The Mad King</h4>
<p>I slept late and spent the tail of the morning reading over my own
notes on Palace etiquette and the observations on Gethenian psychology
and manners made by my predecessors, the Investigators. I didn’t take in
what I read, which didn’t matter since I knew it by heart and was
reading merely to shut up the interior voice that kept telling me, It
has all gone wrong. When it would not be shut up I argued with it,
asserting that I could get on without Estraven - perhaps better than
with him. After all, my job here was a one-man job. There is only one
First Mobile. The first news from the Ekumen on any world is spoken by
one voice, one man present in the flesh, present and alone. He may be
killed, as Pellelge was on Four-Taurus, or locked up with madmen, as
were the first three Mobiles on Gao, one after the other; yet the
practice is kept, because it works. One voice speaking truth is a
greater force than fleets and armies, given time; plenty of time; but
time is the thing that the Ekumen has plenty of …You don’t said the
interior voice, but I reasoned it into silence, and arrived at the
Palace for my audience with the king at Second Hour full of calm and
resolution. It was all knocked right out of me in die anteroom, before I
ever saw the king.</p>
<p>Palace guards and attendants had showed me to the anteroom, through
the long halls and corridors of the King’s House. An aide asked me to
wait and left me alone in the high windowless room. There I stood, all
decked out for a visit with royalty. I had sold my fourth ruby (the
Investigators having reported that Gethenians value the carbon jewels
much as Terrans do, I came to Winter with a pocketful of gems to pay my
way), and spent a third of the proceeds on clothes for the parade
yesterday and the audience today: everything new, very heavy and
well-made as clothing is in Karhide, a white knitfur shirt, gray
breeches, the long tabard-like overtunic, hieb, of bluegreen leather,
new cap, new gloves tucked at the proper angle under the loose belt of
the hieb, new boots. . . . The assurance of being well dressed augmented
my feeling of calm and resolution. I looked calmly and resolutely about
me. Like all the King’s House this room was high, red, old, bare, with a
musty chill on the air as if the drafts blew in not from other rooms but
from other centuries. A fire roared in the fireplace, but did no good.
Fires in Karhide are to warm the spirit not the flesh. The
mechanical-industrial Age of Invention in Karhide is at least three
thousand years old, and during those thirty centuries they have
developed excellent and economical central-heating devices using steam,
electricity, and other principles; but they do not install them in their
houses. Perhaps if they did they would lose their physiological
weatherproofing, like Arctic birds kept in warm tents, who being
released get frostbitten feet. I, however, a tropical bird, was cold;
cold one way outdoors and cold another way indoors, ceaselessly and more
or less thoroughly cold. I walked up and down to warm myself. There was
little besides myself and the fire in the long anteroom: a stool and a
table on which stood a bowl of finger stones and an ancient radio of
carved wood inlaid with silver and bone, a noble piece of workmanship.
It was playing at a whisper, and I turned it a touch louder, hearing the
Palace Bulletin replace the droning Chant or Lay that was being
broadcast. Karhiders do not read much as a rule, and prefer their news
and literature heard not seen; books and televising devices are less
common than radios, and newspapers don’t exist. I had missed the morning
Bulletin on my set at home, and half-listened now, my mind elsewhere,
until the repetition of the name several times caught my ear at last and
stopped my pacing. What was it about Estraven? A proclamation was being
reread.</p>
<p>“Therein Harth rem ir Estraven, Lord of Estre in Kerm, by this order
forfeits title of the Kingdom and seat in the Assemblies of the Kingdom,
and is commanded to quit the Kingdom and all Domains of Karhide. If he
be not gone out of the Kingdom and all Domains in three days’ time, or
if in his life he return into the Kingdom, he shall be put to death by
any man without further judgment. No countryman of Karhide shall suffer
Harth rem ir Estraven to speak to him or stay within his house or on his
lands, on pain of imprisonment, nor shall any countryman of Karhide give
or lend Harth rem ir Estraven money or goods, nor repay any debt owing
him, on pain of imprisonment and fine. Let all countrymen of Karhide
know and say that the crime for which Harth rem ir Estraven is exiled is
the crime of Treason: he having urged privily and openly in Assembly and
Palace, under pretense of loyal service to the King, that the
Nation-Dominion of Karhide cast away its sovereignty and surrender up
its power in order to become an inferior and subject nation in a certain
Union of Peoples, concerning which let all men know and say that no such
Union does exist, being a device and baseless fiction of certain
conspiring traitors who seek to weaken the Authority of Karhide in the
King, to the profit of the real and present enemies of the land.
Odguyrny Tuwa, Eighth Hour, in the Palace in Erhenrang: ARGAVEN
HARGE.”</p>
<p>The order was printed and posted on several gates and road-posts
about the city, and the above is verbatim from one such copy.</p>
<p>My first impulse was simple. I cut off the radio as if to stop it
from giving evidence against me, and scuttled to the door. There of
course I stopped. I went back to the table by the fireplace, and stood.
I was no longer calm or resolute. I wanted to open my case, get out the
ansible, and send an Advise/Urgent! through to Hain. I suppressed this
impulse also, as it was even sillier than the first. Fortunately I had
no time for more impulses. The double door at the far end of the
anteroom was opened and the aide stood aside for me to pass, announcing
me, “Genry Ai”-my name is Genly, but Karhiders can’t say l - and left me
in the Red Hall with King Argaven XV.</p>
<p>An immense, high, long room, that Red Hall of the King’s House. Half
a mile down to the fireplaces. Half a mile up to the raftered ceiling
hung with red, dusty drapes or banners all ragged with the years. The
windows are only slits or slots in the thick walls, the lights few,
high, and dim. My new boots goeck, eck, eck, eck as I walk down the hall
towards the king, a six months’ journey.</p>
<p>Argaven was standing in front of the central and largest fireplace of
three, on a low, large dais or platform: a short figure in the reddish
gloom, rather potbellied, very erect, dark and featureless in silhouette
except for the glint of the big seal-ring on his thumb.</p>
<p>I stopped at the edge of the dais and, as I had been instructed, did
and said nothing.</p>
<p>“Come up, Mr. Ai. Sit down.”</p>
<p>I obeyed, taking the right-hand chair by the central hearth. In all
this I had been drilled. Argaven did not sit down; he stood ten feet
from me with the roaring bright flames behind him, and presently said,
“Tell me what you have to tell me, Mr. Ai. You bear a message, they
say.”</p>
<p>The face that turned towards me, reddened and cratered by firelight
and shadow, was as flat and cruel as the moon, Winter’s dull rufous
moon. Argaven was less kingly, less manly, than he looked at a distance
among his courtiers. His voice was thin, and he held his fierce lunatic
head at an angle of bizarre arrogance.</p>
<p>“My lord, what I have to say is gone out of my head. I only just now
learned of Lord Estraven’s disgrace.”</p>
<p>Argaven smiled at that, a stretched, staring grin. He laughed shrilly
like an angry woman pretending to be amused. “Damn him,” he said, “the
proud, posturing, perjuring traitor! You dined with him last night, eh?
And he told you what a powerful fellow he is, and how he runs the king,
and how easy you’ll find me to deal with since he’s been talking to me
about you-eh? Is that what he told you, Mr. Ai?”</p>
<p>I hesitated.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what he’s been saying to me about you, if you’ve an
interest in knowing. He’s been advising me to refuse you audience, keep
you hanging about waiting, maybe pack you off to Orgoreyn or the
Islands. All this halfmonth he’s been telling me, damn his insolence!
It’s he that got packed off to Orgoreyn, ha ha ha-!” Again the shrill
false laugh, and he clapped his hands together as he laughed. A silent
immediate guard appeared between curtains at the end of the dais.
Argaven snarled at him and he vanished. Still laughing and still
snarling Argaven came up close and stared straight at me. The dark
irises of his eyes glowed slightly orange. I was a good deal more afraid
of him than I had expected to be.</p>
<p>I could see no course to follow among these incoherencies but that of
candor. I said, “I can only ask you, sir, whether I’m considered to be
implicated in Estraven’s crime.”</p>
<p>“You? No.” He stared even more closely at me. “I don’t know what the
devil you are, Mr. Ai, a sexual freak or an artificial monster or a
visitor from the Domains of the Void, but you’re not a traitor, you’ve
merely been the tool of one. I don’t punish tools. They do harm only in
the hands of a bad workman. Let me give you some advice.” Argaven said
this with curious emphasis and satisfaction, and even then it occurred
to me that nobody else, in two years, had ever given me advice. They
answered questions, but they never openly gave advice, not even Estraven
at his most helpful. It must have to do with shifgrethor. “Let no one
else use you, Mr. Ai,” the king was saying. “Keep clear of factions.
Tell your own lies, do your own deeds. And trust no one. D’you know
that? Trust no one. Damn that lying coldblooded traitor, I trusted him.
I put the silver chain around his damned neck. I wish I’d hanged him
with it. I never trusted him. Never. Don’t trust anybody. Let him starve
in the cesspits of Mishnory hunting garbage, let his bowels rot, never-”
King Argaven shook, choked, caught his breath with a retching sound, and
turned his back on me. He kicked at the logs of the great fire till
sparks whirled up thick in his face and fell on his hair and his black
tunic, and he caught at them with open hands.</p>
<p>Not turning around he spoke in a shrill painful voice: “Say what
you’ve got to say, Mr. Ai.”</p>
<p>“May I ask you a question, sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” He swayed from foot to foot as he stood facing the fire. I had
to address his back.</p>
<p>“Do you believe that I am what I say I am?”</p>
<p>“Estraven had the physicians send me endless tapes about you, and
more from the engineers at the Workshops who have your vehicle, and so
on. They can’t all be liars, and they all say you’re not human. What
then?”</p>
<p>“Then, sir, there are others like me. That is, I’m a representative .
..”</p>
<p>“Of this union, this Authority, yes, very well. What did they send
you here for, is that what you want me to ask?”</p>
<p>Though Argaven might be neither sane nor shrewd, he had had long
practice in the evasions and challenges and rhetorical subtleties used
in conversation by those whose main aim in life was the achievement and
maintenance of the shifgrethor relationship on a high level. Whole areas
of that relationship were still blank to me, but I knew something about
the competitive, prestige-seeking aspect of it, and about the perpetual
conversational duel which can result from it. That I was not dueling
with Argaven, but trying to communicate with him, was itself an
incommunicable fact.</p>
<p>“I’ve made no secret of it, sir. The Ekumen wants an alliance, with
the nations of Gethen.”</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“Material profit. Increase of knowledge. The augmentation of the
complexity and intensity of the field of intelligent life. The
enrichment of harmony and the greater glory of God. Curiosity.
Adventure. Delight.”</p>
<p>I was not speaking the tongue spoken by those who rule men, the
kings, conquerors, dictators, generals; in that language there was no
answer to his question. Sullen and unheeding, Argaven stared at the
fire, shifting from foot to foot.</p>
<p>“How big is this kingdom out in Nowhere, this Ekumen?”</p>
<p>“There are eighty-three habitable planets in the Ekumenical Scope,
and on them about three thousand nations or anthrotypic groups-”</p>
<p>“Three thousand? I see. Now tell me why we, one against three
thousand, should have anything to do with all these nations of monsters
living out in the Void?” He turned around now to look at me, for he was
still dueling, posing a rhetorical question, almost a joke. But the joke
did not go deep. He was-as Estraven had warned me-uneasy, alarmed.</p>
<p>“Three thousand nations on eighty-three worlds, sir; but the nearest
to Gethen is seventeen years’ journey in ships that go at near
lightspeed. If you’ve thought that Gethen might be involved in forays
and harassments from such neighbors, consider the distance at which they
live. Forays are worth no one’s trouble, across space.” I did not speak
of war, for a good reason; there’s no word for it in Karhidish. “Trade,
however, is worthwhile. In ideas and techniques, communicated by’
ansible; in goods and artifacts, sent by manned or unmanned ships.
Ambassadors, scholars, and merchants, some of them might come here; some
of yours might go offworld. The Ekumen is not a kingdom, but a
coordinator, a clearinghouse for trade and knowledge; without it
communication between the worlds of men would be haphazard, and trade
very risky, as you can see. Men’s lives are too short to cope with the
time-jumps between worlds, if there’s no network and centrality, no
control, no continuity to work through; therefore they become members of
the Ekumen. . . . We are all men, you know, sir. All of us. All the
worlds of men were settled, eons ago, from one world, Hain. We vary, but
we’re all sons of the same Hearth….”</p>
<p>None of this caught the king’s curiosity or gave him any reassurance.
I went on a bit, trying to suggest that his shifgrethor, or Karhide’s,
would be enhanced, not threatened by the presence of the Ekumen, but it
was no good. Argaven stood there sullen as an old she-otter in a cage,
swinging back and forth, from foot to foot, back and forth, baring his
teeth in a grin of pain. I stopped talking.</p>
<p>“Are they all as black as you?”</p>
<p>Gethenians are yellow-brown or red-brown, generally, but I had seen a
good many as dark as myself. “Some are blacker,” I said; “we come all
colors,” and I opened the case (politely examined by the guards of the
Palace at four stages of my approach to the Red Hall) that held my
ansible and some pictures. The pictures-films, photos, paintings,
actives, and some cubes-were a little gallery of Man: people of Hain,
Chiffewar, and the Cetians, of S and Terra and Alterra, of the
Uttermosts, Kapteyn, Ollul, Four-Taurus, Rokanan, Ensbo, Cime, Gde and
Sheashel Haven. . . . The king glanced at a couple without interest.
“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“A person from Cime, a female.” I had to use the word that Gethenians
would apply only to a person in the culminant phase of kemmer, the
alternative being their word for a female animal.</p>
<p>“Permanently?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He dropped the cube and stood swinging from foot to foot, staring at
me or a little past me, the firelight shifting on his face. “They’re all
like that-like you?”</p>
<p>This was the hurdle I could not lower for them. They must, in the
end, learn to take it in their stride.</p>
<p>“Yes. Gethenian sexual physiology, so far as we yet know, is unique
among human beings.”</p>
<p>“So all of them, out on these other planets, are in permanent kemmer?
A society of perverts? So Lord Tibe put it; I thought he was joking.
Well, it may be the fact, but it’s a disgusting idea, Mr. Ai, and I
don’t see why human beings here on earth should want or tolerate any
dealings with creatures so monstrously different. But then, perhaps
you’re here to tell me I have no choice in the matter.”</p>
<p>“The choice, for Karhide, is yours, sir.”</p>
<p>“And if I send you packing, too?”</p>
<p>“Why, I’ll go. I might try again, with another generation. …”</p>
<p>That hit him. He snapped, “Are you immortal?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all, sir. But the time-jumps have their uses. If I left
Gethen now for the nearest world, Ollul, I’d spend seventeen years of
planetary time getting there. Time-jumping is a function of traveling
nearly as fast as light. If I simply turned around and came back, my few
hours spent on the ship would, here, amount to thirty-four years; and I
could start all over.” But the idea of time-jumping, which with its
false hint of immortality had fascinated everyone who listened to me,
from the Horden Island fisherman on up to the Prime Minister, left him
cold. He said in his shrill harsh voice, “What’s that?”-pointing to the
ansible.</p>
<p>“The ansible communicator, sir.”</p>
<p>“A radio?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t involve radio waves, or any form of energy. The principle
it works on, the constant of simultaneity, is analogous in some ways to
gravity-” I had forgotten again that I wasn’t talking to Estraven, who
had read every report on me and who listened intently and intelligently
to all my explanations, but instead to a bored king. “What it does, sir,
is produce a message at any two points simultaneously. Anywhere. One
point has to be fixed, on a planet of a certain mass, but the other end
is portable. That’s this end. I’ve set the coordinates for the Prime
World, Hain. A NAFAL ship takes 67 years to go between Gethen and Hain,
but if I write a message on that keyboard it will be received on Hain at
the same moment as I write it. Is there any communication you’d care to
make with the Stabiles on Hain, sir?”</p>
<p>“I don’t speak Voidish,” said the king with his dull, malign
grin.</p>
<p>“They’ll have an aide standing ready-I alerted them -who can handle
Karhidish.”</p>
<p>“What d’you mean? How?”</p>
<p>“Well, as you know, sir, I’m not the first alien to come to Gethen. I
was preceded by a team of Investigators, who didn’t announce their
presence, but passed as well as they could for Gethenians, and traveled
about in Karhide and Orgoreyn and the Archipelago for a year. They left,
and reported to the Councils of the Ekumen, over forty years ago, during
your grandfather’s reign. Their report was extremely favorable. And so I
studied the information they’d gathered, and the languages they’d
recorded, and came. Would you like to see the device working, sir?”</p>
<p>“I don’t like tricks, Mr. Ai.”</p>
<p>“It’s not a trick, sir. Some of your own scientists have
examined-”</p>
<p>“I’m not a scientist.”</p>
<p>“You’re a sovereign, my lord. Your peers on the Prime World of the
Ekumen wait for a word from you.”</p>
<p>He looked at me savagely. In trying to flatter and interest him I had
cornered him in a prestige-trap. It was all going wrong.</p>
<p>“Very well. Ask your machine there what makes a man a traitor.”</p>
<p>I typed out slowly on the keys, which were set to Karhidish
characters, “King Argaven of Karhide asks the Stabiles on Hain what
makes a man a traitor.” The letters burned across the small screen and
faded. Argaven watched, his restless shifting stilled for a minute.</p>
<p>There was a pause, a long pause. Somebody seventy-two light-years
away was no doubt feverishly punching demands on the language computer
for Karhidish, if not on a philosophy-storage computer. At last the
bright letters burned up out of the screen, hung a while, and faded
slowly away: “To King Argaven of Karhide on Gethen, greetings. I do not
know what makes a man a traitor. No man considers himself a traitor:
this makes it hard to find out. Respectfully, Spimolle G. F., for the
Stabiles, in Saire on Hain, 93/1491/45.”</p>
<p>When the tape was recorded I pulled it out and gave it to Argaven. He
dropped it on the table, walked again to the central fireplace, almost
into it, and kicked the flaming logs and beat down the sparks with his
hands. “As useful an answer as I might get from any Foreteller. Answers
aren’t enough, Mr. Ai. Nor is your box, your machine there. Nor your
vehicle, your ship. A bag of tricks and a trickster. You want me to
believe you, your tales and messages. But why need I believe, or listen?
If there are eighty thousand worlds full of monsters out there among the
stars, what of it? We want nothing from them. We’ve chosen our way of
life and have followed it for a long time. Karhide’s on the brink of a
new epoch, a great new age. We’ll go our own way.” He hesitated as if he
had lost the thread of his argument-not his own argument, perhaps, in
the first place.</p>
<p>If Estraven was no longer the King’s Ear, somebody else was. “And if
there were anything these Ekumens wanted from us, they wouldn’t have
sent you alone. It’s a joke, a hoax. Aliens would be here by the
thousand.”</p>
<p>“But it doesn’t take a thousand men to open a door, my lord.”</p>
<p>“It might to keep it open.”</p>
<p>“The Ekumen will wait till you open it, sir. It will force nothing on
you. I was sent alone, and remain here alone, in order to make it
impossible for you to fear me.”</p>
<p>“Fear you?” said the king, turning his shadow-scarred face, grinning,
speaking loud and high. “But I do fear you, Envoy. I fear those who sent
you. I fear liars, and I fear tricksters, and worst I fear the bitter
truth. And so I rule my country well. Because only fear rules men.
Nothing else works. Nothing else lasts long enough. You are what you say
you are, yet you’re a joke, a hoax. There’s nothing in between the stars
but void and terror and darkness, and you come out of that all alone
trying to frighten me. But I am already afraid, and I am the king. Fear
is king! Now take your traps and tricks and go, there’s no more needs
saying. I have ordered that you be given the freedom of Karhide.”</p>
<p>So I departed from the royal presence - eck, eck, eck all down the
long red floor in the red gloom of the hall, until at last the double
doors shut me off from him.</p>
<p>I had failed. Failed all around. What worried me as I left the King’s
House and walked through the Palace grounds, however, was not my
failure, but Estraven’s part in it. Why had the king exiled him for
advocating the Ekumen’s cause (which seemed to be the meaning of the
proclamation) if (according to the king himself) he had been doing the
opposite? When had he started advising the king to steer clear of me,
and why? Why was he exiled, and I let go free? Which of them had lied
more, and what the devil were they lying for?</p>
<p>Estraven to save his skin, I decided, and the king to save his face.
The explanation was neat. But had Estraven, in fact, ever lied to me? I
discovered that I did not know.</p>
<p>I was passing the Corner Red Dwelling. The gates of the garden stood
open. I glanced in at the serem trees leaning white above the dark pool,
the paths of pink brick lying deserted in the serene gray light of
afternoon. A little snow still lay in the shadow of the rocks by the
pool. I thought of Estraven waiting for me there as the snow fell last
night, and felt a pang of pure pity for the man whom I had seen in
yesterday’s parade sweating and superb under the weight of his panoply
and power, a man at the prime of his career, potent and magnificent-gone
now, down, done. Running for the border with his death three days behind
him, and no man speaking to him. The death-sentence is rare in Karhide.
Life on Winter is hard to live, and people there generally leave death
to nature or to anger, not to law. I wondered how Estraven, with that
sentence driving him, would go. Not in a car, for they were all Palace
property here; would a ship or landboat give him passage? Or was he
afoot on the road, carrying what he could carry with him? Karhiders go
afoot, mostly; they have no beasts of burden, no flying vehicles, the
weather makes slow going for powered traffic most of the year, and they
are not a people who hurry. I imagined the proud man going into exile
step by step, a small trudging figure on the long road west to the Gulf.
All this went through my mind and out of it as I passed the gate of the
Corner Red Dwelling, and with it went my confused speculations
concerning the acts and motives of Estraven and the king. I was done
with them. I had failed. What next?</p>
<p>I should go to Orgoreyn, Karhide’s neighbor and rival. But once I
went there I might find it hard to return to Karhide, and I had
unfinished business here. I had to keep in mind that my entire life
could be, and might well be, used in achieving my mission for the
Ekumen. No hurry. No need to rush off to Orgoreyn before I had learned
more about Karhide, particularly about the Fastnesses. For two years I
had been answering questions, now I would ask some. But not in
Erhenrang. I had finally understood that Estraven had been warning me,
and though I might distrust his warning I could not disregard it. He had
been saying, however indirectly, that I should get away from the city
and the court. For some reason I thought of Lord Tibe’s teeth. . . . The
king had given me the freedom of the country; I would avail myself of
it. As they say in Ekumenical School, when action grows unprofitable,
gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep. I was
not sleepy, yet. I would go east to the Fastnesses, and gather
information from the Foretellers, perhaps.</p>
