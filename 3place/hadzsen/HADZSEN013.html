<h4 id="on-time-and-darkness">12. On Time and Darkness</h4>
<p>From The Sayings of Tuhulme the High Priest,a book of the Yomesh
Canon, composed in North Or-goreyn about 900 years ago.</p>
<p>Meshe is the Center of Time. That moment -of his life when he saw all
things clearly came when he had lived on earth thirty years, and after
it he lived on earth again thirty years, so that the Seeing befell in
the center of his life. And all the ages up until the Seeing were as
long as the ages will be after the Seeing, which befell in the Center of
Time. And in the Center there is no time past and no time to come. In
all time past it is. In all time to come it is. It has not been nor yet
will it be. It is. It is all.</p>
<p>Nothing is unseen.</p>
<p>The poor man of Sheney came to Meshe lamenting that he had not food
to give the child of his flesh, nor grain to sow, for the rains had
rotted the seed in the ground and all the folk of his hearth starved.
Meshe said, “Dig in the stone-fields of Tuerresh, and you will find
there a treasure of silver and precious stones; for I see a king bury it
there, ten thousand years ago, when a neighboring king presses feud upon
him.”</p>
<p>The poor man of Sheney dug in the moraines of Tuerresh and unearthed
where Meshe pointed a great hoard of ancient jewels, and at sight of it
he shouted aloud for joy. But Meshe standing by wept at sight of it,
saying, “I see a man kill his hearth-brother for one of those carven
stones. That is ten thousand years from now, and the bones of the
murdered man will lie in this grave where the treasure lies. O man of
Sheney, I know too where your grave is: I see you lying in it.” .</p>
<p>The life of every man is in the Center of Time, for all were seen in
the Seeing of Meshe, and are in his Eye. We are the pupils of his Eye.
Our doing is his Seeing: our being his Knowing.</p>
<p>A hemmen-tree in the heart of Ornen Forest, which lies a hundred
miles long and a hundred miles wide, was old and greatly grown, with a
hundred branches and on every branch a thousand twigs and on every twig
a hundred leaves. The tree said in its rooted being, “All my leaves are
seen, but one, this one in the darkness cast by all the others. This one
leaf I keep secret to myself. Who will see it in the darkness of my
leaves? and who will count the number of them?”</p>
<p>Meshe passed through the Forest of Ornen in his wanderings, and from
that one tree plucked that one leaf.</p>
<p>No raindrop falls in the storms of autumn that ever fell before, and
the rain has fallen, and falls, and will fall throughout all the autumns
of the years. Meshe saw each drop, where it fell, and falls, and will
fall.</p>
<p>In the Eye of Meshe are all the stars, and the darknesses between the
stars: and all are bright.</p>
<p>In the answering of the Question of the Lord of Shorth, in the moment
of the Seeing, Meshe saw all the sky as if it were all one sun. Above
the earth and under the earth all the sphere of sky was bright as the
sun’s surface, and there was no darkness. For he saw not what was, nor
what will be, but what is. The stars that flee and take away their light
all were present in his eye, and all their light shone presently.*</p>
<p>*This is a mystical expression of one of the theories used to support
the expanding-universe hypothesis, first proposed by the Mathematical
School of Sith over four thousand years ago and generally accepted by
later cosmologist even though meteorological conditions on Gethen
prevent their gathering much observational support from astronomy. The
rate of expansion (Hubble’s constant; Rerherek’s constant) can in fact
be estimated from the observed amount of light in the night sky; the
point here involved is that, if the universe were not expanding, the
night sky would not appear to be dark.</p>
<p>Darkness is only in the mortal eye, that thinks it sees, but sees
not. In the Sight of Meshe there is no darkness.</p>
<p>Therefore those that call upon the darkness** are made fools of and
spat out from the mouth of Meshe, for they name what is not, calling it
Source and End.</p>
<p>**The Handdarata.</p>
<p>There is neither source nor end, for all things are in the Center of
Time. As all the stars may be reflected in a round raindrop falling in
the night: so too do all the stars reflect the raindrop. There is
neither darkness nor death, for all things are, in the light of the
Moment, and their end and their beginning are one.</p>
<p>One center, one seeing, one law, one light. Look now into the Eye of
Meshe!</p>
