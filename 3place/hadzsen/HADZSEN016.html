<h4 id="to-the-ice">15. To the Ice</h4>
<p>I woke. Until now it had been strange, unbelievable, to wake up
inside a dim cone of warmth, and to hear my reason tell me that it was a
tent, that I lay in it, alive, that I was not still in Pulefen Farm.
This time there was no strangeness in my waking, but a grateful sense of
peace. Sitting up I yawned and tried to comb back my matted hair with my
fingers. I looked at Estraven, stretched out sound asleep on his
sleeping-bag a couple of feet from me. He wore nothing but his breeches;
he was hot. The dark secret face was laid bare to the light, to my gaze.
Estraven asleep looked a little stupid, like everyone asleep: a round,
strong face, relaxed and remote, small drops of sweat on the upper lip
and over the heavy eyebrows. I remembered how he had stood sweating on
the parade-stand in Erhenrang in panoply of rank and sunlight. I saw him
now defenseless and half-naked in a colder light, and for the first time
saw him as he was.</p>
<p>He woke late, and was slow in waking. At last he staggered up
yawning, pulled on his shirt, stuck his head out to judge the weather,
and then asked me if I wanted a cup of orsh. When he found that I had
crawled about and brewed up a pot of the stuff with the water he had
left in a pan as ice on the stove last night, he accepted a cup, thanked
me stiffly, and sat down to drink it.</p>
<p>“Where do we go from here, Estraven?”</p>
<p>“It depends on where you want to go, Mr. Ai. And on what kind of
travel you can manage.”</p>
<p>“What’s the quickest way out of Orgoreyn?”</p>
<p>“West. To the coast. Thirty miles or so.”</p>
<p>“What then?”</p>
<p>“The harbors will be freezing or already frozen, here. In any case no
ships go out far in winter. It would be a matter of waiting in hiding
somewhere until next spring, when the great traders go out to Sith and
Perunter. None will be going to Karhide, if the trade-embargoes
continue. We might work our passage on a trader. I am out of money,
unfortunately.”</p>
<p>“Is there any alternative?”</p>
<p>“Karhide. Overland.”</p>
<p>“How far is it-a thousand miles?”</p>
<p>“Yes, by road. But we couldn’t go on the roads. We wouldn’t get past
the first Inspector. Our only way would be north through the mountains,
east across the Gobrin, and down to the border at Guthen Bay.”</p>
<p>“Across the Gobrin - the ice-sheet, you mean?”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>“It’s not possible in winter, is it?”</p>
<p>“I think so; with luck, as in all winter journeys. In one respect a
Glacier crossing is better in winter. The good weather, you know, tends
to stay over the great glaciers, where the ice reflects the heat of the
sun; the storms are pushed out to the periphery. Therefore the legends
about the Place inside the Blizzard. That might be in our favor. Little
else.”</p>
<ul>
<li>glacier,英 [ˈɡlæsiə(r)] 美 [ˈɡleɪʃər] n. 冰河，冰川</li>
</ul>
<p>“Then you seriously think-”</p>
<p>“There would have been no point taking you from Pule-fen Farm if I
did not.”</p>
<p>He was still stiff, sore, grim. Last night’s conversation had shaken
us both.</p>
<p>“And I take it that you consider the Ice-crossing a better risk than
waiting about till spring for a sea-cross-ing?” -</p>
<p>He nodded. “Solitude,” he explained, laconic. I thought it over for a
while. “I hope you’ve taken my inadequacies into account. I’m not as
coldproof as you, nowhere near it. I’m no expert on skis. I’m not in
good shape-though much improved from a few days ago.”</p>
<p>Again he nodded. “I think we might make it,” he said, with that
complete simplicity I had so long taken for irony. “All right.”</p>
<p>He glanced at me, and drank down his cup of tea. Tea it might as well
be called; brewed from roasted perm-grain, orsh is a brown, sweet-sour
drink, strong in vitamins A and C, sugar, and a pleasant stimulant
related to lobeline. <strong>Where there is no beer on Winter there is
orsh; where there is neither beer nor orsh, there are no
people.</strong></p>
<p>“It will be hard,” he said, setting down his cup. “Very had. Without
luck, we will not make it.”</p>
<p>“<strong>I’d rather die up on the Ice than in that cesspool you got
me out of.</strong>”</p>
<p>He cut off a chunk of dried breadapple, offered me a slice, and sat
meditatively chewing. “We’ll need more food,” he said.</p>
<p>“What happens if we do make it to Karhide-to you, I mean? You’re
still proscribed.”</p>
<p>He turned his dark, otter’s glance on me. “Yes. I suppose I’d stay on
this side.”</p>
<p>“And when they found you’d helped their prisoner escape-?”</p>
<p>“They needn’t find it.” He smiled, bleak, and said, “First we have to
cross the Ice.”</p>
<p>I broke out, “Listen, Estraven, will you forgive what I said
yesterday-”</p>
<p>“Nusuth.”He stood up, still chewing, put on his hieb, coat, and
boots, and slipped otterlike out the self-sealing valved door. From
outside he stuck his head back in: “I may be late, or gone overnight.
Can you manage here?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“All right.” With that he was off. <strong>I never knew a person who
reacted so wholly and rapidly to a changed situation as
Estraven.</strong> I was recovering, and willing to go; he was out of
thangen; the instant that was all clear, he was off. He was never rash
or hurried, but he was always ready. It was the secret, no doubt, of the
extraordinary political career he threw away for my sake; it was also
the explanation of his belief in me and devotion to my mission. When I
came, he was ready. Nobody else on Winter was.</p>
<p>Yet he considered himself a slow man, poor in emergencies.</p>
<p>Once he told me that, being so slow-thinking, he had to guide his
acts by a general intuition of which way his “luck” was running, and
that this intuition rarely failed him. He said it seriously; it may have
been true. <strong>The Foretellers of the Fastnesses are not the only
people on Winter who can see ahead.</strong> They have tamed and trained
the hunch, but not increased its certainty. In this matter the Yomeshta
also have a point: the gift is perhaps not strictly or simply one of
foretelling, but is rather the power of seeing (if only for a flash)
everything at once: seeing whole.</p>
<p>I kept the little heater-stove at its hottest setting while Estraven
was gone, and so got warm clear through for the first time in-how long?
I thought it must be Them by now, the first month of winter and of a new
Year One, but I had lost count in Pulefen.</p>

<p>The stove was one of those excellent and economical devices perfected
by the Gethenians in their millennial effort to outwit cold. Only the
use of a fusion-pack as power source could improve it. Its
bionic-powered battery was good for fourteen months’ continuous use, its
heat output was intense, it was stove, heater, and lantern all in one,
and it weighed about four pounds. We would never have got fifty miles
without it. It must have cost a good deal of Estraven’s money, that
money I had loftily handed over to him in Mishnory. The tent, which was
made of plastics developed for weather-resistance and designed to cope
with at least some of the inside water-condensation that is the plague
of tents in cold weather; the pesthry-fur sleeping-bags; the clothes,
skis, sledge, food-supplies, everything was of the finest make and kind,
lightweight, durable, expensive. If he had gone to get more food, what
was he going to get it with?</p>
<ul>

<p>He did not return till nightfall next day. I had gone out several
times on snowshoes, gathering strength and getting practice by waddling
around the slopes of the snowy vale that hid our tent. I was competent
on skis, but not much good on snowshoes. I dared not go far over the
hilltops, lest I lose my backtrack; it was wild country, steep, full of
creeks and ravines, rising fast to the cloud-haunted mountains eastward.
I had time to wonder what I would do in this forsaken place if Estraven
did not come back.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>He came swooping over the dusky hill-he was a magnificent skier-and
stopped beside me, dirty and tired and heavy-laden. He had on his back a
huge sooty sack stuffed full of bundles: Father Christmas, who pops down
the chimneys of old Earth. The bundles contained kadik-germ, dried
breadapple, tea, and slabs of the hard, red, earthy-tasting sugar that
Gethenians refine from one of their tubers.</p>
<ul>
<li>sooty,英 [ˈsʊti] 美 [ˈsʊti] adj. 乌黑的；煤烟熏黑的 vt.

</ul>
<p>“How did you get all this?”</p>
<p>“Stole it,” said the one-time Prime Minister of Kar-hide, holding his
hands over the stove, which he had not yet turned down; he, even he, was
cold. “In Turuf. Close thing.” That was all I ever learned. He was not
proud of his exploit, and not able to laugh at it. <strong>Stealing is a
vile crime on Winter; indeed the only man more despised than the thief
is the suicide.</strong></p>
<p>“We’ll use up this stuff first,” he said, as I set a pan of snow on
the stove to melt. “It’s heavy.” Most of the food he had laid in
previously was “hyperfood” rations, a fortified, dehydrated, compressed,
cubed mixture of high-energy foods-the Orgota name for it is
gichy-michy, and that’s what we called it, though of course we spoke
Karhidish together. We had enough of it to last us sixty days at the
minimal standard ration: a pound a day apiece. After he had washed up
and eaten, Estraven sat a long time by the stove that night figuring out
precisely what we had and how and when we must use it. We had no scales,
and he had to estimate, using a pound box of gichy-michy as standard. He
knew, as do many Gethenians, the caloric and nutritive value of each
food; he knew his own requirements under various conditions, and how to
estimate mine pretty closely. Such knowledge has high survival-value, on
Winter.</p>
<p>When at last he had got our rations planned out, he rolled over onto
his bag and went to sleep. During the night I heard him talking numbers
out of his dreams: weights, days, distances….</p>
<p>We had, very roughly, eight hundred miles to go. The first hundred
would be north or northeast, going through the forest and across the
northernmost spurs of the Sembensyen range to the great glacier, the
ice-sheet that covers the double-lobed Great Continent everywhere north
of the 45th parallel, and in places dips down almost to the 35th. One of
these southward extensions is in the region of the Fire-Hills, the last
peaks of the Sembensyens, and that region was our first goal. There
among the mountains, Estraven reasoned, we should be able to get onto
the surface of the ice-sheet, either descending onto it from a
mountain-slope or climbing up to it on the slope of one of its effluent
glaciers. Thereafter we would travel on the Ice itself, eastward, for
some six hundred miles. Where its edge trends north again near the Bay
of Guthen we would come down off it and cut southeast a last fifty or a
hundred miles across the Shenshey Bogs, which by then should be ten or
twenty feet deep in snow, to the Karhidish border.</p>
<p>This route kept us clear from start to finish of inhabited, or
inhabitable, country. We would not be meeting any Inspectors. This was
indubitably of the first importance. I had no papers, and Estraven said
that his wouldn’t hold up under any further forgeries. In any case,
though I could pass for a Gethenian when no one expected anything else,
I was not disguisable to an eye looking for me. In this respect, then,
the way - Estraven proposed for us was highly practical.</p>
<p>In all other respects it seemed perfectly insane.</p>
<p>I kept my opinion to myself, for I fully meant what I’d said about
preferring to die escaping, if it came down to a choice of deaths.
Estraven, however, was still exploring alternatives. Next day, which we
spent in loading and packing the sledge very carefully, he said, “If you
raised the Star Ship, when might it come?”</p>
<p>“Anywhere between eight days and a halfmonth, depending on where it
is in its solar orbit relative to Gethen. It might be on the other side
of the sun.”</p>
<p>“No sooner?”</p>
<p>“No sooner. The NAFAL motive can’t be used within a solar system. The
ship can come in only on rocket drive, which puts her at least eight
days away. Why?”</p>
<p>He tugged a cord tight and knotted it before he answered. “I was
considering the wisdom of trying to ask aid from your world, as mine
seems unhelpful. There’s a radio beacon in Turuf.”</p>
<p>“How powerful?”</p>
<p>“Not very. The nearest big transmitter would be in Kuhumey, about
four hundred miles south of here.”</p>
<p>“Kuhumey’s a big town, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“A quarter of a million souls.”</p>
<p>“We’d have to get the use of the radio transmitter somehow; then hide
out for at least eight days, with the Sarf alerted. . . . Not much
chance.”</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>I lugged the last sack of kadik-germ out of the tent, fitted it into
its niche in the sledge-load, and said, “If I had called the ship that
night in Mishnory-the night you told me to-the night I was arrested. . .
. But Obsle had my ansible; still has it, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Can he use it?”</p>
<p>“No. Not even by chance, fiddling about. The coordinate-settings are
extremely complex. But if only I’d used itl”</p>
<p>“If only I’d known the game was already over, that day,” he said, and
smiled. He was not one for regrets.</p>
<p>“You did, I think. But I didn’t believe you.”</p>
<p>When the sledge was loaded, he insisted that we spend the rest of the
day doing nothing, storing energy. He lay in the tent writing, in a
little notebook, in his small, rapid, vertical-cursive Karhidish hand,
the account that appears as the previous chapter. He hadn’t been able to
keep up his journal during the past month, and that annoyed him; he was
pretty methodical about that journal. Its writing was, I think, both an
obligation to and a link with his family, the Hearth of Estre. I learned
that later, however; at the time I didn’t know what he was writing, and
I sat waxing skis, or doing nothing. I whistled a dance-tune, and
stopped myself in the middle. We only had one tent, and if we were going
to share it without driving each other mad, a certain amount of
self-restraint, of manners, was evidently required. . . . Estraven had
looked up at my whistling, all right, but not with irritation. He looked
at me rather dreamily, and said, “I wish I’d known about your Ship last
year. . . . Why did they send you onto this world alone?”</p>
<p>“The First Envoy to a world always comes alone. One alien is a
curiosity, two are an invasion.”</p>
<p>“The First Envoy’s life is held cheap.”</p>
<p>“No; the Ekumen really doesn’t hold anybody’s life cheap. So it
follows, better to put one life in danger than two, or twenty. It’s also
very expensive and time-consuming, you know, shipping people over the
big jumps. Anyhow, I asked for the job.”</p>
<p>“In danger, honor,” he said, evidently a proverb, for he added
mildly, “We’ll be full of honor when we reach Karhide. …”</p>
<p>When he spoke, I found myself believing that we would in fact reach
Karhide, across eight hundred miles of mountain, ravine, crevasse,
volcano, glacier, ice-sheet, frozen bog or frozen bay, all desolate,
shelterless, and lifeless, in the storms of midwinter in the middle of
an Ice Age. He sat writing up his records with the same obdurate patient
thoroughness I had seen in a mad king up on a scaffolding mortaring a
joint, and said,”When we reach Karhide….”</p>
<p>His when was no mere dateless hope, either. He intended to reach
Karhide by the fourth day of the fourth month of winter, Arhad Anner. We
were to start tomorrow, the thirteenth of the first month, Tormenbod
Them. Our rations, as well as he could calculate, might be stretched at
farthest to three Gethenian months, 78 days; so we would go twelve miles
a day for seventy days, and get to Karhide on Arhad Anner. That was all
settled. No more to do now but get a good sleep.</p>
<p>We set off at dawn, on snowshoes, in a thin, windless snowfall. The
surface over the hills wasbessa, soft and still unpacked, what Terran
skiers I think call “wild” snow. The sledge was heavy loaded; Estraven
guessed the total weight to pull at something over 300 pounds. It was
hard to pull in the fluffy snow, though it was as handy as a
well-designed little boat; the runners were marvels, coated with a
polymer that cut resistance almost to nothing, but of course that was no
good when the whole thing was stuck in a drift. On such a surface, and
going up and down slopes and gullies, we found it best to go one in
harness pulling and one behind pushing. The snow fell, fine and mild,
all day long. We stopped twice for a bite of food. In all the vast hilly
country there was no sound. We went on, and all of a sudden it was
twilight. We halted in a valley very like the one we had left that
morning, a dell among white-humped hills. I was so tired I staggered,
yet I could not believe the day was over. We had covered, by the
sledge-meter, almost fifteen miles.</p>
<p>If we could go that well in soft snow, fully loaded, through a steep
country whose hills and valleys all ran athwart our way, then surely we
could do better up on the Ice, with hard snow, a level way, and a load
always lighter. My trust in Estraven had been more willed than
spontaneous; now I believed him completely. We would be in Karhide in
seventy days.</p>
<p>“You’ve traveled like this before?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“Sledged? Often.”</p>
<p>“Long hauls?”</p>
<p>“I went a couple of hundred miles on the Kerm Ice one autumn, years
ago.”</p>
<p>The lower end of Kerm Land, the mountainous southernmost peninsula of
the Karhide semi-continent, is, like the north, glaciated. Humanity on
the Great Continent of Gethen lives in a strip of land between two white
walls. A further decrease of8% in solar radiation, they calculate, would
bring the walls creeping together; there would be no men, no land; only
ice.</p>
<p>“What for?”</p>
<p>“Curiosity, adventure.” He hesitated and smiled slightly. “The
augmentation of the complexity and intensity of the field of intelligent
life,” he said, quoting one of my Ekumenical quotations.</p>
<p>“Ah: you were consciously extending the evolutionary tendency
inherent in Being; one manifestation of which is exploration.” We were
both well pleased with ourselves, sitting in the warm tent, drinking hot
tea and waiting for the kadik-germ porridge to boil.</p>
<p>“That’s it,” he said. “Six of us. All very young. My brother and I
from Estre, four of our friends from Stok. There was no purpose for the
journey. We wanted to see Teremander, a mountain that stands up out of
the Ice, down there. Not many people have seen it from the land.”</p>
<p>The porridge was ready, a different matter from the stiff bran mush
of Pulefen Farm; it tasted like the roast chestnuts of Terra, and burned
the mouth splendidly. Warm through, benevolent, I said, “The best food
I’ve eaten on Gethen has always been in your company, Estraven.”</p>
<p>“Not at that banquet in Mishnory.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s true. . . . You hate Orgoreyn, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“Very few Orgota know how to cook. Hate Orgoreyn? No, how should I?
How does one hate a country, or love one? Tibe talks about it; I lack
the trick of it. I know people, I know towns, farms, hills and rivers
and rocks, I know how the sun at sunset in autumn falls on the side of a
certain plowland in the hills; but what is the sense of giving a
boundary to all that, of giving it a name and ceasing to love where the
name ceases to apply? What is love of one’s country; is it hate of one’s
uncountry? Then it’s not a good thing. Is it simply self-love? That’s a
good thing, but one mustn’t make a virtue of it, or a profession. . . .
Insofar as I love life, I love the hills of the Domain of Estre, but
that sort of love does not have a boundary-line of hate. And beyond
that, I am ignorant, I hope.”</p>
<p>Ignorant, in the Handdara sense: to ignore the abstraction, to hold
fast to the thing. There was in this attitude something feminine, a
refusal of the abstract, the ideal, a submissiveness to the given, which
rather displeased me.</p>
<p>Yet he added, scrupulous, “A man who doesn’t detest a bad government
is a fool. And if there were such a thing as a good government on earth,
it would be a great joy to serve it.”</p>
<p>There we understood each other. “I know something of that joy,” I
said.</p>
<p>“Yes; so I judged.”</p>
<p>I rinsed our bowls with hot water and dumped the rinsings out the.
valve-door of the tent. It was blind dark outside; snow fell fine and
thin, just visible in the oval dim shaft of light from the valve. Sealed
again in the dry warmth of the tent, we laid out our bags. He said
something, “Give the bowls to me, Mr. Ai,” or some such remark, and I
said, “Is it going to be ‘Mr.’ clear across the Gobrin Ice?”</p>
<p>He looked up and laughed. “I don’t know what to call you.”</p>
<p>“My name is Genly Ai.”</p>
<p>“I know. You use my landmine.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to call you either.”</p>
<p>“Harth.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m Ai.-Who uses first names?”</p>
<p>“Hearth-brothers, or friends,” he said, and saying it was remote, out
of reach, two feet from me in a tent eight feet across. No answer to
that. What is more arrogant than honesty? Cooled, I climbed into my fur
bag. “Good night, Ai,” said the alien, and the other alien said, “Good
night, Harth.”</p>
<p>A friend. What is a friend, in a world where any friend may be a
lover at a new phase of the moon? Not I, locked in my virility: no
friend to Therein Harth, or any other of his race. Neither man nor
woman, neither and both, cyclic, lunar, metamorphosing under the hand’s
touch, changelings in the human cradle, they were no flesh of mine, no
friends; no love between us.</p>
<p>We slept. I woke once and heard the snow ticking thick and soft on
the tent.</p>
<p>Estraven was up at dawn getting breakfast. The day broke bright. We
loaded up and were off as the sun gilded the tops of the scrubby bushes
rimming the dell, Estraven pulling in harness and I as pusher and rudder
at the stern. The snow was beginning to get a crust on it; on clear
downslopes we went like a dog-team, at a run. That day we skirted and
then entered the forest that borders Pulefen Farm, the forest of dwarfs,
thick-set, gnurl-limbed, ice-bearded thore-trees. We dared not use the
main road north, but logging-roads lent their direction to us sometimes
for a while, and as the forest was kept clear of fallen trees and
undergrowth we got on well. Once we were in Tarrenpeth there were fewer
ravines or steep ridges. The sledge-meter at evening said twenty miles
for the day’s run, and we were less tired than the night before.</p>
<p>One palliative of winter on Winter is that the days stay light. The
planet has a few degrees of tilt to the plane of the ecliptic, not
enough to make an appreciable seasonal difference in low latitudes.
Season is not a hemispheric effect but a global one, a result of the
elliptoid orbit. At the far and slow-moving end of the orbit,
approaching and departing from aphelion, there is just enough loss of
solar radiation to disturb the already uneasy weather patterns, to chill
down what is cold already, and turn the wet gray summer into white
violent winter. Dryer than the rest of the year, winter might be
pleasanter, if it were not for the cold. The sun, when you see it,
shines high; there is no slow bleeding away of light into the darkness,
as on the polar slopes of Earth where cold and night come on
together.</p>
<p>Gethen has a bright winter, bitter, terrible, and bright.</p>
<p>We were three days getting through Tarrenpeth Forest. On the last,
Estraven stopped and made camp early, in order to set traps. He wanted
to catch some pesthry. They are one of the larger land-animals of
Winter, about the size of a fox, oviparous vegetarians with a splendid
coat of gray or white fur. He was after the meat, for pesthry are
edible. They were migrating south in vast numbers; they are so
light-footed and solitary that we saw only two or three as we hauled,
but the snow was thick-starred in every glade of the there-forest with
countless little snowshoe tracks, all heading south. Estraven’s snares
were full in an hour or two. He cleaned and cut up the six beasts, hung
some of the meat to freeze, stewed some for our meal that night.
Gethenians are not a hunting people, because there is very little to
hunt-no large herbivores, thus no large carnivores, except in the
teeming seas. They fish, and farm. I had never before seen a Gethenian
with blood on his hands.</p>
<p>Estraven looked at the white pelts. “There’s a week’s room and board
for a pesthry-hunter,” he said. “Gone to waste.” He held out one for me
to touch. The fur was so soft and deep that you could not be certain
when your hand began to feel it. Our sleeping-bags, coats, and hoods
were lined with that same fur, an unsurpassed insulator and very
beautiful to see. “Hardly seems worth it,” I said, “for a stew.”</p>
<p>Estraven gave me his brief dark stare and said, “We need protein.”
And tossed away the pelts, where overnight the russy, the fierce little
rat-snakes, would devour them and the entrails and the bones, and lick
clean the bloody snow.</p>
<p>He was right; he was generally right. There was a pound or two of
edible meat on a pesthry. I ate my half of the stew that night and could
have eaten his without noticing. Next morning, when we started up into
the mountains, I was twice the sledge-engine I had been.</p>
<p>We went up that day. The beneficent snowfall and kroxet- windless
weather between 0° F. and 20°-that had seen us through Tarrenpeth and
out of range of probable pursuit, now dissolved wretchedly into
above-freezing temperatures and rain. Now I began to understand why
Gethenians complain when the temperature rises in winter, and cheer up
when it falls. In the city, rain is an inconvenience; to a traveler it
is a catastrophe. We hauled that sledge up the flanks of the Sembensyens
all morning through a deep, cold porridge of rain-sodden snow. By
afternoon on steep slopes the snow was mostly gone. Torrents of rain,
miles of mud and gravel. We cased the runners, put the wheels on the
sledge, and hauled on up. As a wheeled cart it was a bitch, sticking and
tipping every moment. Dark fell before we found any shelter of cliff or
cave to set up the tent in, so that despite all our care things got wet.
Estraven had said that a tent such as ours would house us pretty
comfortably in any weather at all, so long as we kept it dry inside.
“Once you can’t dry out your bags, you lose too much body-heat all
night, and you don’t sleep well. Our food-ration’s too short to allow us
to afford that. We can’t count on any sunlight to dry things out, so we
must not get them wet.” I had listened, and had been as scrupulous as he
about keeping snow and wet out of the tent, so that there was only the
unavoidable moisture from our cooking, and our lungs and pores, to be
evaporated. But this night everything was wet through before we could
get the tent up. We huddled steaming over the Chabe stove, and presently
had a stew of pesthry meat to eat, hot and solid, good enough almost to
compensate for everything else. The sledge-meter, ignoring the hard
uphill work we had done all day, said we had come only nine miles.</p>
<p>“First day we’ve done less than our stint,” I said.</p>
<p>Estraven nodded, and neatly cracked a legbone for the marrow. He had
stripped off his wet outer clothes and sat in shirt and breeches,
barefoot, collar open. I was still too cold to take off my coat and hieb
and boots. There he sat cracking marrowbones, neat, tough, durable, his
sleek furlike hair shedding the water like a bird’s feathers: he dripped
a little onto his shoulders, like house-eaves dripping, and never
noticed it. He was not discouraged. He belonged here.</p>
<p>The first meat-ration had given me some intestinal cramps, and that
night they got severe. I lay awake in the soggy darkness loud with
rain.</p>
<p>At breakfast he said, “You had a bad night.”</p>
<p>“How did you know?” For he slept very deeply, scarcely moving, even
when I left the tent.</p>
<p>He gave me that look again. “What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Diarrhea.”</p>
<p>He winced and said savagely, “It’s the meat,”</p>
<p>“I suppose so.”</p>
<p>“My fault. I should-”</p>
<p>“It’s all right.”</p>
<p>“Can you travel?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Rain fell and fell. A west vyind off the sea kept the temperature in
the thirties, even here at three or four thousand feet of altitude. We
never saw more than a quarter-mile ahead through the gray mist and mass
of rain. What slopes rose on above us I never looked up to see: nothing
to see but rain falling. We went by compass, keeping as much to
northward as the cut and veer of the great slopes allowed.</p>
<p>The glacier had been over these mountainsides, in the hundreds of
thousands of years it had been grinding back and forth across the North.
There were tracks scored along granite slopes, long and straight as if
cut with a great U-gouge. We could pull the sledge along those scratches
sometimes as if along a road.</p>
<p>I did best pulling; I could lean into the harness, and the work kept
me warm. When we stopped for a bite of food at midday, I felt sick and
cold, and could not eat. We went on, climbing again now. Rain fell, and
fell, and fell. Estraven stopped us under a great overhang of black
rock, along in mid-afternoon. He had the tent up almost before I was out
of harness. He ordered me to go in and. lie down.</p>
<p>“I’m all right,” I said.</p>
<p>“You’re not,” he said. “Go on.”</p>
<p>I obeyed, but I resented his tone. When he came into the tent with
our night’s needs, I sat up to cook, it being my turn. He told me in the
same peremptory tone to lie still.</p>
<p>“You needn’t order me about,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he said inflexibly, his back turned.</p>
<p>“I’m not sick, you know.”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t know. If you won’t say frankly, I must go by your
looks. You haven’t recovered your strength, and the going has been hard.
I don’t know where your limits lie.”</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you when I reach them.”</p>
<p>I was galled by his patronizing. He was a head shorter than I, and
built more like a woman than a man, more fat than muscle; when we hauled
together I had to shorten my pace to his, hold in my strength so as not
to out-pull him: a stallion in harness with a mule-</p>
<p>“You’re no longer ill, then?”</p>
<p>“No. Of course I’m tired. So are you.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am,” he said. “I was anxious about you. We have a long way to
go.”</p>
<p>He had not meant to patronize. He had thought me sick, and sick men
take orders. He was frank, and expected a reciprocal frankness that I
might not be able to supply. He, after all, had no standards of
manliness, of virility, to complicate his pride.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if he could lower all his standards of
shifgrethor, as I realized he had done with me, perhaps I could dispense
with the more competitive elements of my masculine self-respect, which
he certainly understood as little as I understood shifgrethor. . . .</p>
<p>“How much of it did we cover today?”</p>
<p>He looked around and smiled a little, gently. “Six miles,” he
said.</p>
<p>The next day we did seven miles, the next day twelve, and the day
after that we came out of the rain, and out of the clouds, and out of
the regions of mankind. It was the ninth day of our journey. We were
five to six thousand feet above sea level now, on a high plateau full of
the evidences of recent mountain-building and vulcanism; we were in the
Fire-Hills of the Sembensyen Range. The plateau narrowed gradually to a
valley and the valley to a pass between long ridges. As we approached
the end of the pass the rainclouds were thinning and rending. A cold
north wind dispersed them utterly, laying bare the peaks above the
ridges to our right and left, basalt and snow, piebald and patchwork of
black and white brilliant under the sudden sun in a dazzling sky. Ahead
of us, cleared and revealed by the same vast sweep of the wind, lay
twisted valleys, hundreds of feet below, full of ice and boulders.
Across those valleys a great wall stood, a wall of ice, and raising our
eyes up and still up to the rim of the wall we saw the Ice itself, the
Gobrin Glacier, blinding and horizonless to the utmost north, a white, a
white the eyes could not look on.</p>
<p>Here and there out of the valleys full of rubble and out of the
cliffs and bends and masses of the great icefield’s edge, black ridges
rose; one great mass loomed up out of the plateau to the height of the
gateway peaks we stood between, and from its side drifted heavily a
mile-long wisp of smoke. Farther off there were others: peaks,
pinnacles, black cindercones on the glacier. Smoke panted from fiery
mouths that opened out of the ice.</p>
<p>Estraven stood there in harness beside me looking at that magnificent
and unspeakable desolation. “I’m glad I have lived to see this,” he
said.</p>
<p>I felt as he did. It is good to have an end to journey towards; but
it is the journey that matters, in the end.</p>
<p>It had not rained, here on these north-facing slopes. Snow-fields
stretched down from the pass into the valleys of moraine. We stowed the
wheels, uncapped the sledge-runners, put on our skis, and took off-down,
north, onward, into that silent vastness of fire and ice that said in
enormous letters of black and white DEATH, DEATH, written right across a
continent. The sledge pulled like a feather, and we laughed with
joy.</p>
