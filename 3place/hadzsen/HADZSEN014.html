<h4 id="down-on-the-farm">13. Down on the Farm</h4>
<p>Alarmed by Estraven’s sudden reappearance, his familiarity with my
affairs, and the fierce urgency of his warnings, I hailed a taxi and
drove straight to Obsle’s island, meaning to ask the Commensal how
Estraven knew so much and why he had suddenly popped up from nowhere
urging me to do precisely what Obsle yesterday had advised against
doing. The Commensal was out, the doorkeeper did not know where he was
or when he would be in. I went to Yegey’s house with no better luck. A
heavy snow, the heaviest of the autumn so far, was falling; my driver
refused to take me farther than to Shusgis’ house, as he did not have
snow-cleats on his tires. That evening I failed to reach Obsle, Yegey,
or Slose by telephone.</p>
<p>At dinner Shusgis explained: a Yomesh festival was going on, the
Solemnity of the Saints and Throne-Upholders, and high officials of the
Commensality were expected to be seen at the temples. He also explained
Estraven’s behavior, shrewdly enough, as that of a man once powerful and
now fallen, who grasps at any chance to influence persons or
events-always less rationally, more desperately, as time passes and he
knows himself sinking into powerless anonymity. I agreed that this would
explain Estraven’s anxious, almost frantic manner. The anxiety had
however infected me. I was vaguely ill at ease all through that long and
heavy meal. Shusgis talked and talked to me and to the many employees,
aides and sycophants who sat down at his table nightly; I had never
known him so longwinded, so relentlessly jovial. When dinner was over it
was pretty late for going out again, and in any case the Solemnity would
keep all the Commensals busy, Shusgis said, until a^ter midnight. I
decided to pass up supper, and went to bed early. Some time between
midnight and dawn I was awakened by strangers, informed that I was under
arrest, and taken by an armed guard to the Kundershaden Prison.</p>
<p>Kundershaden is old, one of the few very old buildings left in
Mishnory. I had noticed it often as I went about the city, a long grimy
many-towered ill-looking place, distinct among the pallid bulks and
hulks of the Commensal edifices. It is what it looks like and is called.
It is a jail. It is not a front for something else, not a fagade, not a
pseudonym. It is real, the real thing, the thing behind the words.</p>
<p>The guards, a sturdy, solid lot, hustled me through the corridors and
left me alone in a small room, very dirty and very brightly lit. In a
few minutes another lot of guards came crowding in as escort to a
thin-faced man with an air of authority. He dismissed all but two. I
asked him if I would be allowed to send word to Commensal Obsle.</p>
<p>“The Commensal knows of your arrest.”</p>
<p>I said, “Knows of it?” very stupidly.</p>
<p>“My superiors act, of course, by order of the Thirty-Three. -You will
now undergo interrogation.”</p>
<p>The guards caught my arms. I resisted them, saying angrily, “I’m
willing to answer what you ask, you can leave out the intimidation!” The
thin-faced man paid no attention, but called back another guard. The
three of them got me strapped on a pull-down table, stripped me, and
injected me with, I suppose, one” of the veridical drugs.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long the questioning lasted or what it concerned, as
I was drugged more or less heavily all the time and have no memory of
it. When I came to myself again I had no idea how long I had been kept
in Kundershaden: four or five days, judging by my physical condition,
but I was not sure. For some while after that I did not know what day of
the month it was, nor what month, and in fact I came only slowly to
comprehend my surroundings at all.</p>
<p>I was in a caravan-truck, much like the truck that had carried me
over the Kargav to Rer, but in the van; not the cab. There were twenty
or thirty other people in with me, hard to tell how many, since there
were no windows and light came only through a slit in the rear door,
screened with four thicknesses of steel mesh. We had evidently been
traveling some while when I recovered conscious thought, as each
person’s place was more or less defined, and the smell of excreta,
vomit, and sweat had already reached a point it neither surpassed nor
declined from. No one knew any of the others. No one knew where we were
being taken. There was little talking. It was the second time I had been
locked in the dark with uncomplaining, unhopeful people of Orgoreyn. I
knew now the sign I had been given, my first night in this country. I
had ignored that black cellar and gone looking for the substance of
Orgoreyn above ground, in daylight. No wonder nothing had seemed
real.</p>
<p>I felt that the truck was going east, and couldn’t get rid of this
impression even when it became plain that it was going west, farther and
farther into Orgoreyn. One’s magnetic and directional sub senses are all
wrong on other planets; when the intellect won’t or can’t compensate for
that wrongness, the result is a profound bewilderment, a feeling that
everything, literally, has come loose.</p>
<p>One of the truckload died that night. He had been clubbed or kicked
in the abdomen, and died hemorrhaging from anus and mouth. No one did
anything for him; there was nothing to be done. A plastic jug of water
had been shoved in amongst us some hours before, but it was long since
dry. The man happened to be next to me on the right, and I took his head
on my knees to give him relief in breathing,- so he died. We were all
naked, but thereafter I wore his blood for clothing, on my legs and
thighs and hands: a dry, stiff, brown garment with no warmth in it.</p>
<p>The night grew bitter, and we had to get close together for warmth.
The corpse, having nothing to give, was pushed out of the group,
excluded. The rest of us huddled together, swaying and jolting all in
one motion, all night. Darkness was total inside our steel box. We were
on some country road, and no truck followed us; even with face pressed
up close to the mesh one could see nothing out the door-slit but
darkness and the vague loom of fallen snow.</p>
<p>Falling snow; new-fallen snow; long-fallen snow; snow after rain has
fallen on it; refrozen snow . . . Orgota and Karhidish have a word for
each of these. In Karhidish (which I know better than Orgota) they have
by my count sixty-two words for the various kinds, states, ages, and
qualities of snow; fallen snow, that is. There is another set of words
for the varieties of snowfall; another for ice; a set of twenty or more
that define what the temperature range is, how strong a wind blows, and
what kind of precipitation is occurring, all together. I sat and tried
to draw up lists of these words in my head that night. Each time I
recalled another one I would repeat the lists, inserting it in its
alphabetical place.</p>
<p>Along after dawn the truck stopped. People screamed out the slit
.that there was a dead body in the truck: come and take it out. One
after another of us screamed and shouted. We pounded together on the
sides and door, making so hideous a pandemonium inside the steel box
that we could not stand it ourselves. No one came. The truck stood still
for some hours. At last there was a sound of voices outside; the truck
lurched, skidding on an ice-patch, and set off again. One could see
through the slit that it was late on a sunny morning, and that we were
going through wooded hills.</p>
<p>The truck continued thus for three more days and nights-four in all
since my awakening. It made no stops at Inspection Points, and I think
it never passed through a town of any size. Its journey was erratic,
furtive. There were stops to change drivers and recharge batteries;
there were other, longer stops for no reason that could be discerned
from inside the van. Two of the days it sat still from noon till dark,
as if deserted, then began its run again at night. Once a day, around
noon, a big jug of water was passed in through a trap in the door.</p>
<p>Counting the corpse there were twenty-six of us, two thirteens.
Gethenians often think in thirteens, twenty-sixes, fifty-twos, no doubt
because of the 26-day lunar cycle that makes their unvarying month and
approximates their sexual cycle. The corpse was shoved up tight against
the steel doors that formed the rear wall of our box, where he would
keep cold. The rest of us sat and lay and crouched, each in his own
place, his territory, his Domain, until night; when the cold grew so
extreme that little by little we drew together and merged into one
entity occupying one space, warm in the middle, cold at the
periphery.</p>
<p>There was kindness. I and certain others, an old man and one with a
bad cough, were recognized as being least resistant to the cold, and
each night we were at the center of the group, the entity of
twenty-five, where it was warmest. We did not struggle for the warm
place, we simply were in it each night. It is a terrible thing, this
kindness that human beings do not lose. Terrible, because when we are
finally naked in the dark and cold, it is all we have. We who are so
rich, so full of strength, we end up with that small change. We have
nothing else to give.</p>
<p>Despite our crowdedness and our huddling together nights, we in the
truck were remote from one another. Some were stupefied from drugging,
some were probably mental or social defectives to start with, all were
abused and scared; yet it may be strange that among twenty-five not one
ever spoke to all the others together, not even to curse them. Kindness
there was and endurance, but in silence, always in silence. Jammed
together in the sour darkness of our shared mortality, we bumped one
another continually, jolted together, fell over one another, breathed
our breaths mingling, laid the heat of our bodies together as a fire is
laid-but remained strangers. I never learned the name of any of them in
the truck.</p>
<p>One day, the third day I think, when the truck stopped still for
hours and I wondered if they had simply left us in some desert place to
rot, one of them began to talk to me. He kept telling me a long story
about a mill in South Orgoreyn where he had worked, and how he had got
into trouble with an overseer. He talked and talked in his soft dull
voice and kept putting his hand on mine as if to be sure he had my
attention. The sun was getting west of us and as we stood slewed around
on the shoulder of the road a shaft of light entered in the window-slit;
suddenly, even back in the box, one could see. I saw a girl, a filthy,
pretty, stupid, weary girl looking up into my face as she talked,
smiling timidly, looking for solace. The young Orgota was in kem-mer,
and had been drawn to me. The one time any one of them asked anything of
me, and I couldn’t give it. I got up and went to the window-slit as if
for air and a look out, and did not come back to my place for a long
time.</p>
<p>That night the truck went up long grades, down, up again. From time
to time it halted inexplicably. At each halt a frozen, unbroken silence
lay outside the steel walls of our box, the silence of vast waste lands,
of the heights. The one in kemmer still kept the place beside mine, and
still sought to touch me. I stood up for a long time again with my face
pressed to the steel mesh of the window, breathing clean air that cut my
throat and lungs like a razor. My hands pressed against the metal door
became numb. I realized at last that they were or soon would be
frostbitten. My breath had made a little ice-bridge between my lips and
the mesh. I had to break this bridge with my fingers before I could turn
away. When I huddled down with the others I began to shake with cold, a
kind of shaking I had not experienced, jumping, racking spasms like the
convulsions of fever. The truck started up again. Noise and motion gave
an illusion of warmth, dispelling that utter, glacial silence, but I was
still too cold to sleep that night. I thought we were at a fairly high
altitude most of the night, but it was hard to tell, one’s breathing,
heartbeat, and energy-level being unreliable indicators, given the
circumstances.</p>
<p>As I knew later, we were crossing the Sembensyens that night, and
must have gone up over nine thousand feet on the passes.</p>
<p>I was not much troubled by hunger. The last meal I remembered eating
was that long and heavy dinner in Shusgis’ house; they must have fed me
in Kunder-shaden, but I had no recollection of it. Eating did not seem
to be a part of this existence in the steel box, and I did not often
think about it. Thirst, on the other hand, was one of the permanent
conditions of life. Once daily at a stop the trap, evidently set into
the rear-door for this purpose, was unbolted; one of us thrust out the
plastic jug and it was soon thrust back in filled, along with a brief
gust of icy air. There was no way to measure out the water among us. The
jug was passed, and each got three or four good swallows before the next
hand reached for it. No one person or group acted as dispensers or
guardians; none saw to it that a drink was saved for the man who
coughed, though he was now in a high fever. I suggested this once and
those around me nodded, but it was not done. The water was shared more
or less equally-no one ever tried to get much more than his share-and
was gone within a few minutes. Once the last three, up against the
forward wall of the box, got none, the jug being dry when it came to
them. The next day two of them insisted on being first in line, and
were. The third lay huddled in his front corner un-stirring, and nobody
saw to it that he got his share. Why didn’t I try to? I don’t know. That
was the fourth day in the truck. If I had been passed over I’m not sure
I would have made an effort to get my share. I was aware of his thirst
and his suffering, and the sick man’s, and the others’, much as I was
aware of my own. I was unable to do anything about any of this
suffering, and therefore accepted it, as they did, placidly.</p>
<p>I know that people might behave very differently in the same
circumstances. These were Orgota, people trained from birth in a
discipline of cooperation, obedience, submission to a group purpose
ordered from above. The qualities of independence and decision were
weakened in them. They had not much capacity for anger. They formed a
whole, I among them; each felt it, and it was a refuge and true comfort
in the night, that wholeness of the huddled group each drawing life from
the others. But there was no spokesman for the whole, it was headless,
passive.</p>
<p>Men whose will was tempered to a sharper edge might have done much
better: talked more, shared the water more justly, given more ease to
the sick, and kept their courage higher. I don’t know. I only know what
it was like inside that truck.</p>
<p>On the fifth morning, if my count is right, from the day I wakened in
the truck, it stopped. We heard talking outside and calling back and
forth. The steel rear-doors were unbolted from the outside and flung
wide open.</p>
<p>One by one we crept to that open end of the steel box, some on hands
and knees, and jumped or crawled down onto the ground. Twenty-four of us
did. Two dead men, the old corpse and a new one, the one who had not got
his drink of water for two days, were dragged out.</p>
<p>It was cold outside, so cold and so glaring with white sunlight on
white snow that to leave the fetid shelter of the truck was very hard,
and some of us wept. We stood bunched up beside the great truck, all of
us naked and stinking, our little whole, our night-entity exposed to the
bright cruel daylight. They broke us up, made us form a line, and led us
towards a building a few hundred yards away. The metal walls and
snow-covered roof of the building, the plain of snow all around, the
great range of mountains that lay under the rising sun, the vast sky,
all seemed to shake and glitter with excess of light.</p>
<p>We were lined up to wash ourselves at a big trough in a frame hut;
everybody began by drinking the wash-water. After that we were led into
the main building and given undershirts, gray felt shirts, breeches,
leggings, and felt boots. A guard checked off our names on a list as we
filed into the refectory, where with a hundred or more other people in
gray we sat at bolted-down tables and were served breakfast:
grain-porridge and beer. After that the whole lot of us, new prisoners
and old, were divided up into squads of twelve. My squad was taken to a
sawmill a few hundred yards behind the main building, inside the fence.
Outside the fence and not far from it a forest began that covered the
folded hills as far to northward as the eye could see. Under the
direction of our guard we carried and stacked sawn boards from the mill
to a huge shed where lumber was stored through the winter.</p>
<p>It was not easy to walk, stoop, and lift loads, after the days in the
truck. They didn’t let us stand idle, but they didn’t force the pace
either. In the middle of the day we were served a cupful of the
unfermented grain-brew, orsh; before sunset we were taken back to the
barracks and given dinner, porridge with some vegetables, and beer. By
nightfall we were locked into the dormitory, which was kept fully
lighted all night. We slept on five-foot-deep shelves all around the
walls of the room in two tiers. Old prisoners scrambled for the upper
tier, the more desirable, since heat rises. For bedding each man was
issued a sleeping-bag at the door. They were coarse heavy bags, foul
with other men’s sweat, but well insulated and warm. Their drawback for
me was their shortness. An average-sized Geth-enian could get clear
inside head and all, but I couldn’t; nor could I ever stretch out fully
on the sleeping-shelf. The place was called Pulefen Commensality Third
Voluntary Farm and Resettlement Agency. Pulefen, District Thirty, is in
the extreme northwest of the habitable zone of Orgoreyn, bounded by the
Sembensyen Mountains, the Esagel River, and the coast. The area is
thinly settled, without big cities. The town nearest us was a place
called Turuf, several miles to the southwest; I never saw it. The Farm
was on the edge of a great unpopulated forest region, Tarrenpeth. Too
far north for the larger trees, hemmen or serem or black vate, the
forest was all of one kind of tree, a gnarled scrubby conifer ten or
twelve feet high, gray-needled, called thore. Though the number of
native species, plant or animal, on Winter is unusually small, the
membership of each species is very large: there were thousands of square
miles of thore-trees, and nothing much else, in that one forest. Even
the wilderness is carefully husbanded there, and though that forest had
been logged for centuries there were no waste places in it, no
desolations of stumps, no eroded slopes. It seemed that every tree in it
was accounted for, and that not one grain of sawdust from our mill went
unused. There was a small plant on the Farm, and when the weather
prevented parties from going out into the forest we worked in the mill
or in the plant, treating and compressing chips, bark, and sawdust into
various forms, and extracting from the dried thore-needles a resin used
in plastics.</p>
<p>The work was genuine work, and we were not overdriven. If they had
allowed a little more food and better clothing much of the work would
have been pleasant, but we were too hungry and cold most of the time for
any pleasure. The guards were seldom harsh and never cruel. They tended
to be stolid, slovenly, heavy, and to my eyes effeminate-not in the
sense of delicacy, etc., but in just the opposite sense: a gross, bland
fleshiness, a bovinity without point or edge. Among my fellow-prisoners
I had also for the first time on Winter a certain feeling of being a man
among women, or among eunuchs. The prisoners had that same flabbiness
and coarseness. They were hard to tell apart; their emotional tone
seemed always low, their talk trivial. I took this lifeless-ness and
leveling at first for the effect of the privation of food, warmth, and
liberty, but I soon found out that it was more specific an effect than
that: it was the result of the drugs given all prisoners to keep them
out of kemmer.</p>
<p>I knew that drugs existed which could reduce or virtually eliminate
the potency phase- of the Gethenian sexual cycle; they were used when
convenience, medicine, or morality dictated abstinence. One kemmer, or
several, could be skipped thus without ill effect. The voluntary use of
such drugs was common and accepted. It had not occurred to me that they
might be administered to unwilling persons.</p>
<p>There were good reasons. A prisoner in kemmer would be a disruptive
element in his work-squad. If let off work, what was to be done with
him?-especially if no other prisoner was in kemmer at the time, as was
possible, there being only some 150 of us. To go through kemmer without
a partner is pretty hard on a Gethenian; better, then, simply obviate
the misery and wasted work-time, and not go through kemmer at alL So
they prevented it.</p>
<p>Prisoners who had been there for several years were psychologically
and I believe to some extent physically adapted to this chemical
castration. They were as sexless as steers. They were without shame and
without desire, like the angels. But it is not human to be without shame
and without desire.</p>
<p>Being so strictly denned and limited by nature, the sexual urge of
Gethenians is really not much interfered with by society: there is less
coding, channeling, and repressing of sex there than in any bisexual
society I know of. Abstinence is entirely voluntary; indulgence is
entirely acceptable. Sexual fear and sexual frustration are both
extremely rare. This was the first case I had seen of the social purpose
running counter to the sexual drive. Being a suppression, not merely a
repression, it produced not frustration, but something more ominous,
perhaps, in the long run: passivity.</p>
<p>There are no communal insects on Winter. Gethenians do not share
their earth as Terrans do with those older societies, those innumerable
cities of little sexless workers possessing no instinct but that of
obedience to the group, the whole. If there were ants on Winter,
Gethenians might have tried to imitate them long ago. The regime of the
Voluntary Farms is a fairly recent thing, limited to one country of the
planet and literally unknown elsewhere. But it is an ominous sign of the
direction that a society of people so vulnerable to sexual control might
take.</p>
<p>At Pulefen Farm we were, as I said, underfed for the work we did, and
our clothing, particularly our footgear, was completely inadequate for
that winter climate. The guards, most of them probationary prisoners,
were not much better off. The intent of the place and its regime was
punitive, but not destructive, and I think it might have been endurable,
without the druggings and the examinations.</p>
<p>Some of the prisoners underwent the examination in groups of twelve;
they merely recited a sort of confessional and catechism, got their
anti-kemmer shot, and were released to work. Others, the political
prisoners, were subjected every fifth day to questioning under
drugs.</p>
<p>I don’t know what drugs they used. I don’t know the purpose of the
questioning. I have no idea what questions they asked me. I would come
to myself in the dormitory after a few hours, laid out on the
sleeping-shelf with six or seven others, some waking like myself, some
still slack and blank in the grip of the drug. When we were all afoot
the guards would take us out to the plant to work; but after the third
or fourth of these examinations I was unable to get up. They let me be,
and next day I could go out with my squad, though I felt shaky. After
the next examination I was helpless for two days. Either the anti-kemmer
hormones or the veridicals evidently had a toxic effect on my
non-Gethenian nervous system, and the effect was cumulative.</p>
<p>I remember planning how I would plead with the Inspector when the
next examination came. I would start by promising to answer truthfully
anything he asked, without drugs; and later I would say to him, “Sir,
don’t you see how useless it is to know the answer to the wrong
question?” Then the Inspector would turn into Faxe, with the
Foreteller’s gold chain around his neck, and I would have long
conversations with Faxe, very pleasantly, while I controlled the drip of
acid from a tube into a vat of pulverized wood-chips. Of course when I
came to the little room where they examined us, the Inspector’s aide had
pulled back my collar and given me the injection before I could speak,
and all I remember from that session, or perhaps the memory is from an
earlier one, is the Inspector, a tired-looking young Orgota with dirty
fingernails, saying drearily, “You must answer my questions in Orgota,
you must not speak any other language. You must speak in Orgota.”</p>
<p>There was no infirmary. The principle of the Farm was work or die;
but there were leniencies in practice-gaps between work and death,
provided by the guards. As I said, they were not cruel; neither were
they kind. They were slipshod and didn’t much care, so long as they kept
out of trouble themselves. They let me and another prisoner stay in the
dormitory, simply left us there in our sleeping-bags as if by oversight,
when it was plain that we could not stand up on our feet. I was
extremely ill after the last examination; the other, a middle-aged
fellow, had some disorder or disease of the kidney, and was dying. As he
could not die all at once, he was allowed to spend some time at it, on
the sleeping-shelf.</p>
<p>I remember him more clearly than anything else in Pulefen Farm. He
was physically a typical Gethenian of the Great Continent, compactly
made, short-legged and short-armed, with a solid layer of subcutaneous
fat giving him even in illness a sleek roundness of body. He had small
feet and hands, rather broad hips, and a deep chest, the breasts
scarcely more developed than in a male of my race. His skin was dark
ruddy-brown, his black hair fine and fur-like. His face was broad, with
small, strong features, the cheekbones pronounced. It is a type not
unlike that of various isolated Terran groups living in very high
altitudes or Arctic areas. His name was Asra; he had been a carpenter.
We talked.</p>
<p>Asra was not, I think, unwilling to die, but he was afraid of dying;
he sought distraction from his fear.</p>
<p>We had little in common other than our nearness to death, and that
was not what we wanted to talk about; so, much of the time, we did not
understand each other very well. It did not matter to him. I, younger
and incredulous, would have liked understanding, comprehension,
explanation. But there was no explanation. We talked.</p>
<p>At night the barracks dormitory was glaring, crowded, and noisy.
During the day the lights were turned off and the big room was dusky,
empty, still. We lay close together on the sleeping-shelf and talked
softly. Asra liked best to tell long meandering tales about his young
days on a Commensal farm in the Kunderer Valley, that broad splendid
plain I had driven through coming from the border to Mishnory. His
dialect was strong, and he used many names of people, places, customs,
tools, that I did not know the meaning of, so I seldom caught more than
the drift of his reminiscences. When he was feeling easiest, usually
around noon, I would ask him for a myth or tale. Most Gethenians are
well stuffed with these. Their literature, though it exists in written
form, is a live oral tradition, and they are all in this sense literate.
Asra knew the Orgota staples, the Short-Tales of Meshe, the tale of
Parsid, parts of the great epics and the novel-like Sea-Traders saga.
These, and bits of local lore recalled from his childhood, he would tell
in his soft slurry dialect, and then growing tired would ask me for a
story. “What do they tell in Karhide?” he would say, rubbing his legs,
which tormented him with aches and shooting pains, and turning to me his
face with its shy, sly, patient smile.</p>
<p>Once I said, “I know a story about people who live on another
world.”</p>
<p>“What kind of world would that be?”</p>
<p>“One like this one, all in all; but it doesn’t go around the sun. It
goes around the star you call Selemy. That’s a yellow star like the sun,
and on that world, under that sun, live other people.”</p>
<p>“That’s in the Sanovy teachings, that about the other worlds. There
used to be an old Sanovy crazy-priest would come by my Hearth when I was
little and tell us children all about that, where the liars go when they
die, and where the suicides go, and where the thieves go- that’s where
we’re going, me and you, eh, one of those places?”</p>
<p>“No, this I’m telling of isn’t a spirit-world. A real one. The people
that live on it are real people, alive, just like here. But
very-long-ago they learned how to fly.” Asra grinned.</p>
<p>“Not by flapping their arms, you know. They flew in machines like
cars.” But it was hard to say in Orgota, which lacks a word meaning
precisely “to fly”; the closest one can come has more the meaning of
“glide.”</p>
<p>“Well, they learned how to make machines that went right over the air
as a sledge goes over snow. And after a while they learned how to make
them go farther and faster, till they went like the stone out of a sling
off the earth and over the clouds and out of the air, clear to another
world, going around another sun. And when they got to that world, what
did they find there but men….”</p>
<p>“Sliding in the air?”</p>
<p>“Maybe, maybe not. . . . When they got to my world, we already knew
how to get about in the air. But they taught us how to get from world to
world, we didn’t yet have the machines for that.”</p>
<p>Asra was puzzled by the injection of the teller into the tale. I was
feverish, bothered by the sores which the drugs had brought out on my
arms and chest, and I could not remember how I had meant to weave the
story.</p>
<p>“Go on,” he said, trying to make sense of it. “What did they do
besides go in the air?”</p>
<p>“Oh, they did much as people do here. But they’re all in kemmer all
the time.”</p>
<p>He chuckled. There was of course no chance of concealment in this
life, and my nickname among prisoners and guards was, inevitably, “the
Pervert.” But where there is no desire and no shame no one, however
anomalous, is singled out; and I think Asra made no connection of this
notion with myself and my peculiarities. He saw it merely as a variation
on an old theme, and so he chuckled a little and said, “In kemmer all
the time. … Is it a place of reward, then? Or a place of
punishment?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, Asra. Which is this world?”</p>
<p>“Neither, child. This here is just the world, it’s how it is. You get
born into it and . . . things are as they are….”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t born into it. I came to it. I chose it.”</p>
<p>The silence and the shadow hung around us. Away off in the country
silence beyond the barracks walls there was one tiny edge of sound, a
handsaw keening: nothing else.</p>
<p>“Ah well. . . . Ah well,” Asra murmured, and sighed, and rubbed his
legs, making a little moaning sound that he was not aware of himself.
“We none of us choose,” he said.</p>
<p>A night or two after that he went into coma, and presently died. I
had not learned what he had been sent to the Voluntary Farm for, what
crime or fault or irregularity in his identification papers, and knew
only that he had been in Pulef en Farm less than a year.</p>
<p>The day after Asra’s death they called me for examination; this time
they had to carry me in, and I can’t remember anything further than
that.</p>
