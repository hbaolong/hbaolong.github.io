<h4 id="homecoming">19. Homecoming</h4>
<p>In a dark windy weather we slogged along, trying to find
encouragement in the sighting of Esherhoth Crags, the first thing not
ice or snow or sky that we had seen for seven weeks. On the map they
were marked as not far from the Shenshey Bogs to the south, and from
Guthen Bay to the east. But it was not a trustworthy map of the Gobrin
area. And we were getting very tired.</p>
<p>We were nearer the southern edge of the Gobrin Glacier than the map
indicated, for we began to meet pressure-ice and crevasses on the second
day of our turn southward. The Ice was not so upheaved and tormented as
in the Fire-Hills region, but it was rotten. There were sunken pits
acres across, probably lakes in summer; false floors of snow that might
subside with a huge gasp all around you into the air-pocket a foot deep
beneath; areas all slit and pocked with little holes and crevasses; and,
more and more often, there were big crevasses, old canyons in the Ice,
some wide as mountain gorges and others only two or three feet across,
but deep. On Odyrny Nimmer (by Estraven’s journal, for I kept none) the
sun shone clear with a strong north wind. As we ran the sledge across
the snow-bridges over narrow crevasses we could look down to left or
right into blue shafts and abysses in which bits of ice dislodged by the
runners fell with a vast, faint, delicate music, as if silver wires
touched thin crystal planes, falling. I remember the racy, dreamy,
light-headed pleasure of that morning’s haul in the sunlight over the
abysses. But the sky began to whiten, the air to grow thick; shadows
faded, blue drained out of the sky and snow. We were not alert to the
danger of white weather on such a surface. As the ice was heavily
corrugated, I was pushing while Estraven pulled; I had my eyes on the
sledge and was shoving away, mind on nothing but how best to shove, when
all at once the bar was nearly wrenched out of my grip as the sledge
shot forward in a sudden lunge. I held on by instinct and shouted “Hey!”
to Estraven to slow him down, thinking he had speeded up on a smooth
patch. But the sledge stopped dead, tilted nose-down, and Estraven was
not there.</p>
<p>I almost let go the sledge-bar to go look for him. It was pure luck
that I did not. I held on, while I stared stupidly about for him, and so
I saw the lip of the crevasse, made visible by the shifting and dropping
of another section of the broken snow-bridge. He had gone right down
feet-first, and nothing kept the sledge from following him but my
weight, which held the rear third of the runners still on solid ice. It
kept tipping a little farther nose-downward, pulled by his weight as he
hung in harness in the pit.</p>
<p>I brought my weight down on the rear-bar and pulled and rocked and
levered the sledge back away from the edge of the crevasse. It did not
come easy. But I threw my weight hard on the bar and tugged until it
began grudgingly to move, and then slid abruptly right away from the
crevasse. Estraven had got his hands onto the edge, and his weight now
aided me. Scrambling, dragged by the harness, he came up over the edge
and collapsed face down on the ice.</p>
<p>I knelt by him trying to unbuckle his harness, alarmed by the way he
sprawled there, passive except for the great gasping rise and fall of
his chest. His lips were cyanotic, one side of his face was bruised and
scraped.</p>
<p>He sat up unsteadily and said in a whistling whisper, “Blue—all blue—
Towers in the depths—”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“In the crevasse. All blue—full of light.”</p>
<p>“Are you all right?”</p>
<p>He started rebuckling his harness.</p>
<p>“You go ahead—on the rope—with the stick,” he gasped. “Pick the
route.”</p>
<p>For hours one of us hauled while the other guided, mincing along like
a cat on eggshells, sounding every step in advance with the stick. In
the white weather one could not see a crevasse until one could look down
into it—a little late, for the edges overhung, and were not always
solid. Every footfall was a surprise, a drop or a jolt. No shadows. An
even, white, soundless sphere: we moved along inside a huge
frosted-glass ball. There was nothing inside the ball, and nothing was
outside it. But there were cracks in the glass. Probe and step, probe
and step. Probe for the invisible cracks through which one might fall
out of the white glass ball, and fall, and fall, and fall… An
unrelaxable tension little by little took hold of all my muscles. It
became exceedingly difficult to take even one more step.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Genry?”</p>
<p>I stood there in the middle of nothing. Tears came out and froze my
eyelids together. I said, “I’m afraid of falling.”</p>
<p>“But you’re on the rope,” he said. Then, coming up and seeing that
there was no crevasse anywhere visible, he saw what was up and said,
“Pitch camp.”</p>
<p>“It’s not time yet, we ought to go on.”</p>
<p>He was already unlashing the tent.</p>
<p>Later on, after we had eaten, he said, “It was time to stop. I don’t
think we can go this way. The Ice seems to drop off slowly, and will be
rotten and crevassed all the way. If we could see, we could make it: but
not in unshadow.”</p>
<p>“But then how do we get down onto the Shenshey Bogs?”</p>
<p>“Well, if we keep east again instead of trending south, we might be
on sound ice clear to Guthen Bay. I saw the Ice once from a boat on the
Bay in summer. It comes up against the Red Hills, and feeds down in
ice-rivers to the Bay. If we came down one of those glaciers we could
run due south on the sea-ice to Karhide, and so enter at the coast
rather than the border, which might be better. It will add some miles to
our way, though— something between twenty and fifty, I should think.
What’s your opinion, Genry?”</p>
<p>“My opinion is that I can’t go twenty more feet so long as the white
weather lasts.”</p>
<p>“But if we get out of the crevassed area…”</p>
<p>“Oh, if we get out of the crevasses I’ll be fine. And if the sun ever
comes out again, you get on the sledge and I’ll give you a free ride to
Karhide.” That was typical of our attempts at humor, at this stage of
the journey; they were always very stupid, but sometimes they made the
other fellow smile. “There’s nothing wrong with me,” I went on, “except
acute chronic fear.”</p>
<p>“Fear’s very useful. Like darkness; like shadows.” Estraven’s smile
was an ugly split in a peeling, cracked brown mask, thatched with black
fur and set with two flecks of black rock. “It’s queer that daylight’s
not enough. We need the shadows, in order to walk.”</p>
<p>“Give me your notebook a moment.”</p>
<p>He had just noted down our day’s journey and done some calculation of
mileage and rations. He pushed the little tablet and carbon-pencil
around the Chabe stove to me. On the blank leaf glued to the inner back
cover I drew the double curve within the circle, and blacked the yin
half of the symbol, then pushed it back to my companion. “Do you know
that sign?”</p>
<p>He looked at it a long time with a strange look, but he said,
“No.”</p>
<p>“It’s found on Earth, and on Hain-Davenant, and on Chiffewar. It is
yin and yang. Light is the left hand of darkness… how did it go? Light,
dark. Fear, courage. Cold, warmth. Female, male. It is yourself, Therem.
Both and one. A shadow on snow.”</p>
<p>The next day we trudged northeast through the white absence of
everything until there were no longer any cracks in the floor of
nothing: a day’s haul. We were on 2/3 ration, hoping to keep the longer
route from running us right out of food. It seemed to me that it would
not matter much if it did, as the difference between little and nothing
seemed a rather fine one. Estraven, however, was on the track of his
luck, following what appeared to be hunch or intuition, but may have
been applied experience and reasoning. We went east for four days, four
of the longest hauls we had made, eighteen to twenty miles a day, and
then the quiet zero weather broke and went to pieces, turning into a
whirl, whirl, whirl of tiny snow-particles ahead, behind, to the side,
in the eyes, a storm beginning as the light died. We lay in the tent for
three days while the blizzard yelled at us, a three-day-long, wordless,
hateful yell from the unbreathing lungs.</p>
<p>“It’ll drive me to screaming back,” I said to Estraven in mindspeech,
and he, with the hesitant formality that marked his rapport: “No use. It
will not listen.”</p>
<p>We slept hour after hour, ate a little, tended our frostbites,
inflammations, and bruises, mindspoke, slept again. The three-day shriek
died down into a gabbling, then a sobbing, then a silence. Day broke.
Through the opened door-valve the sky’s brightness shone. It lightened
the heart, though we were too rundown to be able to show our relief in
alacrity or zest of movement. We broke camp—it took nearly two hours,
for we crept about like two old men—and set off. The way was downhill,
an unmistakable slight grade; the crust was perfect for skis. The sun
shone. The thermometer at midmorning showed -10°. We seemed to get
strength from going, and we went fast and easy. We went that day till
the stars came out.</p>
<p>For dinner Estraven served out full rations. At that rate, we had
enough for only seven days more.</p>
<p>“The wheel turns,” he said with serenity. “To make a good run, we’ve
got to eat.”</p>
<p>“Eat, drink, and be merry,” said I. The food had got me high. I
laughed inordinately at my own words. “All
one-eating-drinking-merrymaking. Can’t have merry without eats, can
you?” This seemed to me a mystery quite on a par with that of the
yin-yang circle, but it did not last. Something in Estraven’s expression
dispelled it. Then I felt like crying, but refrained. Estraven was not
as strong as I was, and it would not be fair, it might make him cry too.
He was already asleep: he had fallen asleep sitting up, his bowl on his
lap. It was not like him to be so unmethodical. But it was not a bad
idea, sleep.</p>
<p>We woke rather late next morning, had a double breakfast, and then
got in harness and pulled our light sledge right off the edge of the
world.</p>
<p>Below the world’s edge, which was a steep rubbly slope of white and
red in a pallid noon light, lay the frozen sea: the Bay of Guthen,
frozen from shore to shore and from Karhide clear to the North Pole.</p>
<p>To get down onto the sea-ice through the broken edges and shelves and
trenches of the Ice jammed up amongst the Red Hills took that afternoon
and the next day. On that second day we abandoned our sledge. We made up
backpacks; with the tent as the main bulk of one and the bags of the
other, and our food equally distributed, we had less than twenty-five
pounds apiece to carry; I added the Chabe stove to my pack and still had
under thirty. It was good to be released from forever pulling and
pushing and hauling and prying that sledge, and I said so to Estraven as
we went on. He glanced back at the sledge, a bit of refuse in the vast
torment of ice and reddish rock. “It did well,” he said. His loyalty
extended without disproportion to things, the patient, obstinate,
reliable things that we use and get used to, the things we live by. He
missed the sledge. That evening, the seventy-fifth of our journey, our
fifty-first day on the plateau, Harhahad Anner, we came down off the
Gobrin Ice onto the sea-ice of Guthen Bay. Again we traveled long and
late, till dark. The air was very cold, but clear and still, and the
clean ice-surface, with no sledge to pull, invited our skis. When we
camped that night it was strange to think, lying down, that under us
there was no longer a mile of ice, but a few feet of it, and then salt
water. But we did not spend much time thinking. We ate, and slept.</p>
<p>At dawn, again a clear day though terribly cold, below -40° at
daybreak, we could look southward and see the coastline, bulged out here
and there with protruding tongues of glacier, fall away southward almost
in a straight line. We followed it close inshore at first. A north wind
helped us along till we skied up abreast a valley-mouth between two high
orange hills; out of that gorge howled a gale that knocked us both off
our feet. We scuttled farther east, out on the level sea-plain, where we
could at least stand up and keep going. “The Gobrin Ice has spewed us
out of its mouth,” I said.</p>
<p>The next day, the eastward curve of the coastline was plain, straight
ahead of us. To our right was Orgoreyn, but that blue curve ahead was
Karhide.</p>
<p>On that day we used up the last grains of orsh, and the last few
ounces of kadik-germ; we had left now two pounds apiece of gichy-michy,
and six ounces of sugar.</p>
<p>I cannot describe these last days of our journey very well, I find,
because I cannot really remember them. Hunger can heighten perception,
but not when combined with extreme fatigue; I suppose all my senses were
very much deadened. I remember having hunger-cramps, but I don’t
remember suffering from them. I had, if anything, a vague feeling all
the time of liberation, of having got beyond something, of joy; also of
being terribly sleepy. We reached land on the twelfth, Posthe Anner, and
clambered over a frozen beach and into the rocky, snowy desolation of
the Guthen Coast.</p>
<p>We were in Karhide. We had achieved our goal. It came near being an
empty achievement, for our packs were empty. We had a feast of hot water
to celebrate our arrival. The next morning we got up and set off to find
a road, a settlement. It is a desolate region, and we had no map of it.
What roads there might be were under five or ten feet of snow, and we
may have crossed several without knowing it. There was no sign of
cultivation. We strayed south and west that day, and the next, and on
the evening of the next, seeing a light shine on a distant hillside
through the dusk and thin falling snow, neither of us said anything for
some time. We stood and stared. Finally my companion croaked, “Is that a
light?”</p>
<p>It was long after dark when we came shambling into a Karhidish
village, one street between high-roofed dark houses, the snow packed and
banked up to their winter-doors. We stopped at the hot-shop, through the
narrow shutters of which flowed, in cracks and rays and arrows, the
yellow light we had seen across the hills of winter. We opened the door
and went in.</p>
<p>It was Odsordny Anner, the eighty-first day of our journey; we were
eleven days over Estraven’s proposed schedule. He had estimated our food
supply exactly: seventy-eight days’ worth at the outside. We had come
840 miles, by the sledge-meter plus a guess for the last few days. Many
of those miles had been wasted in backtracking, and if we had really had
eight hundred miles to cover we should never have made it; when we got a
good map we figured that the distance between Pulefen Farm and this
village was less than 730 miles. All those miles and days had been
across a houseless, speechless desolation: rock, ice, sky, and silence:
nothing else, for eighty-one days, except each other.</p>
<p>We entered into a big steaming-hot bright-lit room full of food and
the smells of food, and people and the voices of people. I caught hold
of Estraven’s shoulder. Strange faces turned to us, strange eyes. I had
forgotten there was anyone alive who did not look like Estraven. I was
terrified.</p>
<p>In fact it was rather a small room, and the crowd of strangers in it
was seven or eight people, all of whom were certainly as taken aback as
I was for a while. Nobody comes to Kurkurast Domain in midwinter from
the north at night. They stared, and peered, and all the voices had
fallen silent.</p>
<p>Estraven spoke, a barely audible whisper. “We ask the hospitality of
the Domain.”</p>
<p>Noise, buzz, confusion, alarm, welcome.</p>
<p>“We came over the Gobrin Ice.”</p>
<p>More noise, more voices, questions; they crowded in on us.</p>
<p>“Will you look to my friend?”</p>
<p>I thought I had said it, but Estraven had. Somebody was making me sit
down. They brought us food; they looked after us, took us in, welcomed
us home.</p>
<p>Benighted, contentious, passionate, ignorant souls, countryfolk of a
poor land, their generosity gave a noble ending to that hard journey.
They gave with both hands. No doling out, no counting up. And so
Estraven received what they gave us, as a lord among lords or a beggar
among beggars, a man among his own people.</p>
<p>To those fishermen-villagers who live on the edge of the edge, on the
extreme habitable limit of a barely habitable continent, honesty is as
essential as food. They must play fair with one another; there’s not
enough to cheat with. Estraven knew this, and when after a day or two
they got around to asking, discreetly and indirectly, with due regard to
shifgrethor, why we had chosen to spend a winter rambling on the Gobrin
Ice, he replied at once, “Silence is not what I should choose, yet it
suits me better than a lie.”</p>
<p>“It’s well known that honorable men come to be outlawed, yet their
shadow does not shrink,” said the hot-shop cook, who ranked next to the
village chief in consequence, and whose shop was a sort of living-room
for the whole Domain in winter.</p>
<p>“One person may be outlawed in Karhide, another in Orgoreyn,” said
Estraven.</p>
<p>“True; and one by his clan, another by the king in Erhenrang.”</p>
<p>“The king shortens no man’s shadow, though he may try,” Estraven
remarked, and the cook looked satisfied. If Estraven’s own clan had cast
him out he would be a suspect character, but the king’s strictures were
unimportant. As for me, evidently a foreigner and so the one outlawed by
Orgoreyn, that was if anything to my credit. We never told our names to
our hosts in Kurkurast. Estraven was very reluctant to use a false name,
and our true ones could not be avowed. It was, after all, a crime to
speak to Estraven, let alone to feed and clothe and house him, as they
did. Even a remote village of the Guthen Coast has radio, and they could
not have pleaded ignorance of the Order of Exile; only real ignorance of
their guest’s identity might give them some excuse. Their vulnerability
weighed on Estraven’s mind, before I had even thought of it. On our
third night there he came into my room to discuss our next move. A
Karhidish village is like an ancient castle of Earth in having few or no
separate, private dwellings. Yet in the high, rambling old buildings of
the Hearth, the Commerce, the Co-Domain (there was no Lord of Kurkurast)
and the Outer-House, each of the five hundred villagers could have
privacy, even seclusion, in rooms off those ancient corridors with walls
three feet thick. We had been given a room apiece, on the top floor of
the Hearth. I was sitting in mine beside the fire, a small, hot,
heavy-scented fire of peat from the Shenshey Bogs, when Estraven came
in. He said.”</p>
<p>“We must soon be going on from here, Genry.”</p>
<p>I remember him standing there in the shadows of the firelit room
barefoot and wearing nothing but the loose fur breeches the chief had
given him. In the privacy and what they consider the warmth of their
houses Karhiders often go half-clothed or naked. On our journey Estraven
had lost all the smooth, compact solidity that marks the Gethenian
physique; he was gaunt and scarred, and his face was burned by cold
almost as by fire. He was a dark, hard, and yet elusive figure in the
quick, restless light.</p>
<p>“Where to?”</p>
<p>“South and west, I think. Towards the border. Our first job is to
find you a radio transmitter strong enough to reach your ship. After
that, I must find a hiding place, or else go back into Orgoreyn for a
while, to avoid bringing punishment on those who help us here.”</p>
<p>“How will you get back into Orgoreyn?”</p>
<p>“As I did before—cross the border. The Orgota have nothing against
me.”</p>
<p>“Where will we find a transmitter?”</p>
<p>“No nearer than Sassinoth.”</p>
<p>I winced. He grinned.</p>
<p>“Nothing closer?”</p>
<p>“A hundred and fifty miles or so; we’ve come farther over worse
ground. There are roads all the way; people will take us in; we may get
a lift on a powersledge.”</p>
<p>I assented, but I was depressed by the prospect of still another
stage of our winter-journey, and this one not towards haven but back to
that damned border where Estraven might go back into exile, leaving me
alone.</p>
<p>I brooded over it and finally said, “There’ll be one condition which
Karhide must fulfill before it can join the Ekumen. Argaven must revoke
your banishment.”</p>
<p>He said nothing, but stood gazing at the fire.</p>
<p>“I mean it,” I insisted. “First things first.”</p>
<p>“I thank you, Genry,” he said. His voice, when he spoke very softly
as now, did have much the timbre of a woman’s voice, husky and
unresonant. He looked at me, gently, not smiling. “But I haven’t
expected to see my home again for a long time now. I’ve been in exile
for twenty years, you know. This is not so much different, this
banishment. I’ll look after myself; and you look after yourself, and
your Ekumen. That you must do alone. But all this is said too soon. Tell
your ship to come down! When that’s done, then I’ll think beyond
it.”</p>
<p>We stayed two more days in Kurkurast, getting well fed and rested,
waiting for a road-packer that was due in from the south and would give
us a lift when it went back again. Our hosts got Estraven to tell them
the whole tale of our crossing of the Ice. He told it as only a person
of an oral-literature tradition can tell a story, so that it became a
saga, full of traditional locutions and even episodes, yet exact and
vivid, from the sulphurous fire and dark of the pass between Drumner and
Dremegole to the screaming gusts from mountain-gaps that swept the Bay
of Guthen; with comic interludes, such as his fall into the crevasse,
and mystical ones, when he spoke of the sounds and silences of the Ice,
of the shadowless weather, of the night’s darkness. I listened as
fascinated as all the rest, my gaze on my friend’s dark face.</p>
<p>We left Kurkurast riding elbow-jammed in the cab of a road-packer,
one of the big powered vehicles that rolls and packs down the snow on
Karhidish roads, the main means of keeping roads open in winter, since
to try to keep them plowed clear would take half the kingdom’s time and
money, and all traffic is on runners in the winter anyway. The packer
ground along at two miles an hour, and brought us into the next village
south of Kurkurast long after nightfall. There, as always, we were
welcomed, fed, and housed for the night; the next day we went on afoot.
We were now landward of the coastal hills that take the brunt of the
north wind off the Bay of Guthen, in a more heavily settled region, and
so went not from camp to camp but from Hearth to Hearth. A couple of
times we did get a lift on a power-sledge, once for thirty miles. The
roads, despite frequent heavy snowfall, were hard-packed and
well-marked. There was always food in our packs, put there by the last
night’s hosts; there was always a roof and a fire at the end of the
day’s going.</p>
<p>Yet those eight or nine days of easy hiking and skiing through a
hospitable land were the hardest and dreariest part of all our journey,
worse than the ascent of the glacier, worse than the last days of
hunger. The saga was over, it belonged to the Ice. We were very tired.
We were going the wrong direction. There was no more joy in us.</p>
<p>“Sometimes you must go against the wheel’s turn,” Estraven said. He
was as steady as ever, but in his walk, his voice, his bearing, vigor
had been replaced by patience, and certainty by stubborn resolve. He was
very silent, nor would he mindspeak with me much.</p>
<p>We came to Sassinoth. A town of several thousand, perched up on hills
above the frozen Ey: roofs white, walls gray, hills spotted black with
forest and rock outcropping, fields and river white; across the river
the disputed Sinoth Valley, all white…</p>
<p>We came there all but empty-handed. Most of what remained of our
travel-equipment we had given away to various kindly hosts, and by now
we had nothing but the Chabe stove, our skis, and the clothes we wore.
Thus unburdened we made our way, asking directions a couple of times,
not into the town but to an outlying farm. It was a meager place, not
part of a Domain but a single-farm under the Sinoth Valley
Administration. When Estraven was a young secretary in that
Administration he had been a friend of the owner, and in fact had bought
this farm for him, a year or two ago, when he was helping people
resettle east of the Ey in hopes of obviating dispute over the ownership
of the Sinoth Valley. The farmer himself opened his door to us, a stocky
soft-spoken man of about Estraven’s age, His name was Thessicher.</p>
<p>Estraven had come through this region with hood pulled up and forward
to hide his face. He feared recognition, here. He hardly needed to; it
took a keen eye to see Harth rem ir Estraven in the thin weatherworn
tramp. Thessicher kept staring at him covertly, unable to believe that
he was who he said he was.</p>
<p>Thessicher took us in, and his hospitality was up to standard though
his means were small. But he was uncomfortable with us, he would rather
not have had us. It was understandable; he risked the confiscation of
his property by sheltering us. Since he owed that property to Estraven,
and might by now have been as destitute as we if Estraven had not
provided for him, it seemed not unjust to ask him to run some risk in
return. My friend, however, asked his help not in repayment but as a
matter of friendship, counting not on Thessicher’s obligation but on his
affection. And indeed Thessicher thawed after his first alarm was past,
and with Karhidish volatility became demonstrative and nostalgic,
recalling old days and old acquaintances with Estraven beside the fire
half the night. When Estraven asked him if he had any idea as to a
hiding place, some deserted or isolated farm where a banished man might
lie low for a month or two in hopes of a revocation of his exile,
Thessicher at once said, “Stay with me.”</p>
<p>Estraven’s eyes lit up at that, but he demurred; and agreeing that he
might not be safe so near Sassinoth, Thessicher promised to find him a
hideout. It wouldn’t be hard, he said, if Estraven would take a false
name and hire out as a cook or farmhand, which would not be pleasant,
perhaps, but certainly better than returning to Orgoreyn. “What the
devil would you do in Orgoreyn? What would you live on, eh?”</p>
<p>“On the Commensality,” said my friend, with a trace of his otter’s
smile. “They provide all Units with jobs, you know. No trouble. But I’d
rather be in Karhide… if you really think it could be managed…”</p>
<p>We had kept the Chabe stove, the only thing of value left to us. It
served us, one way or another, right to the end of our journey. The
morning after our arrival at Thessicher’s farm, I took the stove and
skied into town. Estraven of course did not come with me, but he had
explained to me what to do, and it all went well. I sold the stove at
the Town Commerce, then took the solid sum of money it had fetched up
the hill to the little College of the Trades, where the radio station
was housed, and bought ten minutes of “private transmission to private
reception.” All stations set aside a daily period of time for such
shortwave transmissions; as most of them are sent by merchants to their
overseas agents or customers in the Archipelago, Sith, or Perunter, the
cost is rather high, but not unreasonable. Less, anyway, than the cost
of a secondhand Chabe stove. My ten minutes were to be early in Third
Hour, late afternoon. I did not want to be skiing back and forth from
Thessicher’s farm all day long, so I hung around Sassinoth, and bought a
large, good, cheap lunch at one of the hot-shops. No doubt that
Karhidish cooking was better than Orgota. As I ate, I remembered
Estraven’s comment on that, when I had asked him if he hated Orgoreyn; I
remembered his voice last night, saying with all mildness, “I’d rather
be in Karhide…” And I wondered, not for the first time, what patriotism
is, what the love of country truly consists of, how that yearning
loyalty that had shaken my friend’s voice arises: and how so real a love
can become, too often, so foolish and vile a bigotry. Where does it go
wrong?</p>
<p>After lunch I wandered about Sassinoth. The business of the town, the
shops and markets and streets, lively despite snow-flurries and zero
temperature, seemed like a play, unreal, bewildering. I had not yet come
altogether out of the solitude of the Ice. I was uneasy among strangers,
and constantly missed Estraven’s presence beside me.</p>
<p>I climbed the steep snow-packed street in dusk to the College and was
admitted and shown how to operate the public-use transmitter. At the
time appointed I sent the wake signal to the relay satellite which was
in stationary orbit about 300 miles over South Karhide. It was there as
insurance for just a situation as this, when my ansible was gone so that
I could not ask Ollul to signal the ship, and I had not time or
equipment to make direct contact with the ship in solar orbit. The
Sassinoth transmitter was more than adequate, but as the satellite was
not equipped to respond except by sending to the ship, there was nothing
to do but signal it and let it go at that. I could not know if the
message had been received and relayed to the ship. I did not know if I
had done right to send it. I had come to accept such uncertainties with
a quiet heart.</p>
<p>It had come on to snow hard, and I had to spend the night in town,
not knowing the roads well enough to want to set off on them in the snow
and dark. Having a bit of money still, I inquired for an inn, at which
they insisted that I put up at the College; I had dinner with a lot of
cheerful students, and slept in one of the dormitories. I fell asleep
with a pleasant sense of security, an assurance of Karhide’s
extraordinary and unfailing kindness to the stranger. I had landed in
the right country in the first place, and now I was back. So I fell
asleep; but I woke up very early and set off for Thessicher’s farm
before breakfast, having spent an uneasy night full of dreams and
wakenings.</p>
<p>The rising sun, small and cold in a bright sky, sent shadows westward
from every break and hummock in the snow. The road lay all streaked with
dark and bright. No one moved in all the snowy fields; but away off on
the road a small figure came toward me with the flying, gliding gait of
the skier. Long before I could see the face I knew it for Estraven.</p>
<p>“What’s up, Therem?”</p>
<p>“I’ve got to get to the border,” he said, not even stopping as we
met. He was already out of breath. I turned and we both went west, I
hard put to keep up with him. Where the road turned to enter Sassinoth
he left it, skiing out across the unfenced fields. We crossed the frozen
Ey a mile or so north of town. The banks were steep, and at the end of
the climb we both had to stop and rest. We were not in condition for
this kind of race.</p>
<p>“What happened? Thessicher—?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Heard him on his wireless set. At daybreak.” Estraven’s chest
rose and fell in gasps as it had when he lay on the ice beside the blue
crevasse. “Tibe must have a price on my head.”</p>
<p>“The damned ungrateful traitor!” I said stammering, not meaning Tibe
but Thessicher, whose betrayal was of a friend.</p>
<p>“He is that,” said Estraven, “but I asked too much of him, strained a
small spirit too far. Listen, Genry. Go back to Sassinoth.”</p>
<p>“I’ll at least see you over the border, Therem.”</p>
<p>“There may be Orgota guards there.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay on this side. For God’s sake—”</p>
<p>He smiled. Still breathing very hard, he got up and went on, and I
went with him.</p>
<p>We skied through small frosty woods and over the hillocks and fields
of the disputed valley. There was no hiding, no skulking. A sunlit sky,
a white world, and we two strokes of shadow on it, fleeing. Uneven
ground hid the border from us till we were less than an eighth of a mile
from it: then we suddenly saw it plain, marked with a fence, only a
couple of feet of the poles showing above the snow, the pole-tops
painted red. There were no guards to be seen on the Orgota side. On the
near side there were ski-tracks, and, southward, several small figures
moving.</p>
<p>“There are guards on this side. You’ll have to wait till dark,
Therem.”</p>
<p>“Tibe’s Inspectors,” he gasped bitterly, and swung aside.</p>
<p>We shot back over the little rise we had just topped, and took the
nearest cover. There we spent the whole long day, in a dell among the
thick-growing hemmen trees, their reddish boughs bent low around us by
loads of snow. We debated many plans of moving north or south along the
border to get out of this particularly troubled zone, of trying to get
up into the hills east of Sassinoth, even of going back up north into
the empty country, but each plan had to be vetoed. Estraven’s presence
had been betrayed, and we could not travel in Karhide openly as we had
been doing. Nor could we travel secretly for any distance at all: we had
no tent, no food, and not much strength. There was nothing for it but
the straight dash over the border, no way was open but one.</p>
<p>We huddled in the dark hollow under dark trees, in the snow. We lay
right together for warmth. Around midday Estraven dozed off for a while,
but I was too hungry and too cold for sleep; I lay there beside my
friend in a sort of stupor, trying to remember the words he had quoted
to me once: Two are one, life and death, lying together. … It was a
little like being inside the tent up on the Ice, but without shelter,
without food, without rest: nothing left but our companionship, and that
soon to end.</p>
<p>The sky hazed over during the afternoon, and the temperature began to
drop. Even in the windless hollow it became too cold to sit motionless.
We had to move about, and still around sunset I was taken by fits of
shuddering like those I had experienced in the prison-truck crossing
Orgoreyn. The darkness seemed to take forever coming on. In the late
blue twilight we left the dell and went creeping behind trees and bushes
over the hill till we could make out the line of the border-fence, a few
dim dots along the pallid snow. No lights, nothing moving, no sound.
Away off in the southwest shone the yellow glimmer of a small town, some
tiny Commensal Village of Orgoreyn, where Estraven could go with his
unacceptable identification papers and be assured at least of a night’s
lodging in the Commensal Jail or perhaps on the nearest Commensal
Voluntary Farm. All at once—there, at that last moment, no sooner—I
realized what my selfishness and Estraven’s silence had kept from me,
where he was going and what he was getting into. I said,
“Therem—wait—”</p>
<p>But he was off, downhill: a magnificent fast skier, and this time not
holding back for me. He shot away on a long quick curving descent
through the shadows over the snow. He ran from me, and straight into the
guns of the border-guards. I think they shouted warnings or orders to
halt, and a light sprang up somewhere, but I am not sure; in any case he
did not stop, but flashed on towards the fence, and they shot him down
before he reached it. They did not use the sonic stunners but the foray
gun, the ancient weapon that fires a set of metal fragments in a burst.
They shot to kill him. He was dying when I got to him, sprawled and
twisted away from his skis that stuck up out of the snow, his chest half
shot away. I took his head in my arms and spoke to him, but he never
answered me; only in a way he answered my love for him, crying out
through the silent wreck and tumult of his mind as consciousness lapsed,
in the unspoken tongue, once, clearly, “Areck!” Then no more. I held
him, crouching there in the snow, while he died. They let me do that.
Then they made me get up, and took me off one way and him another, I
going to prison and he into the dark.</p>
