<h4 id="the-question-of-sex">7. The Question of Sex</h4>
<p>From field notes of Ong Tot Oppong, Investigator, of the first
Ekumenical landing party on Gethen/ Winter, Cycle 93E.Y. 1448.</p>
<p>1448 day 81.It seems likely that they were an experiment. The thought
is unpleasant. But now that there is evidence to indicate that the
Terran Colony was an experiment, the planting of one Hainish Normal
group on a world with its own proto-hominid autochthones, the
possibility cannot be ignored. Human genetic manipulation was certainly
practiced by the Colonizers; nothing else explains the hilfs of S or the
degenerate winged hominids of Rokanan; will anything else explain
Geth-enian sexual physiology? Accident, possibly; natural selection,
hardly. Their ambisexuality has little or no adaptive value.</p>
<p>Why pick so harsh a world for an experiment? No answer. Tinibossol
thinks the Colony was introduced during a major Interglacial. Conditions
may have been fairly mild for their first 40 or 50,000 years here. By
the time the ice was advancing again, the Hainish Withdrawal was
complete and the Colonists were on their own, an experiment
abandoned.</p>
<p>I theorize about the origins of Gethenian sexual physiology. What do
I actually know about it? Otie Nim’s communication from the Orgoreyn
region has cleared up some of my earlier misconceptions. Let me set down
all I know, and after that my theories; first things first.</p>
<p>The sexual cycle averages 26 to 28 days (they tend to speak of it as
26 days, approximating it to the lunar cycle). For 21 or 22 days the
individual is somer, sexually inactive, latent. On about the 18th day
hormonal changes are initiated by the pituitary control and on the 22nd
or 23rd day the individual enters kemmer, estrus. In this first phase of
kemmer (Karh. secher) he remains completely androgynous. Gender, and
potency, are not attained in isolation. A Gethenian in first-phase
kemmer, if kept alone or with others not in kemmer, remains incapable of
coitus. Yet the sexual impulse is tremendously strong in this phase,
controlling the entire personality, subjecting all other drives to its
imperative. When the individual finds a partner in kemmer, hormonal
secretion is further stimulated (most importantly by touch-secretion?
scent?) until in one partner either a male or female hormonal dominance
is established. The genitals engorge or shrink accordingly, foreplay
intensifies, and the partner, triggered by the change, takes on the
other sexual role (? without exception? If there are exceptions,
resulting in kemmer-partners of the same sex, they are so rare as to be
ignored). This second phase of kemmer (Karh. thorharmen), the mutual
process of establishing sexuality and potency, apparently occurs within
a time-span of two to twenty hours. If one of the partners is already in
full kemmer, the phase for the newer partner is liable to be quite
short; if the two are entering kemmer together, it is likely to take
longer. Normal individuals have no predisposition to either sexual role
in kemmer; they do not know whether they will be the male or the female,
and have no choice in the matter. (Otie Nim wrote that in the Orgoreyn
region the use of hormone derivatives to establish a preferred sexuality
is quite common; I haven’t seen this done in rural Karhide.) Once the
sex is determined it cannot change during the kem-mer-period. The
culminant phase of kemmer (Karh. thokemmer) lasts from two to five days,
during which sexual drive and capacity are at maximum. It ends fairly
abruptly, and if conception has not taken place, the individual returns
to the somer phase within a few hours (note: Otie Nim thinks this
“fourth phase” is the equivalent of the menstrual cycle) and the cycle
begins anew. If the individual was in the female role and was
impregnated, hormonal activity of course continues, and for the
8.4-month gestation period and the 6- to 8-month lactation period this
individual remains female. The male sexual organs remain retracted (as
they are in somer), the breasts enlarge somewhat, and the pelvic girdle
widens. With the cessation of lactation the female re-enters somer and
becomes once more a perfect androgyne. No physiological habit is
established, and the mother of several children may be the father of
several more.</p>
<p>Social observations: very superficial as yet; I have been moving
about too much to make coherent social observations.</p>
<p>Kemmer is not always played by pairs. Pairing seems to be the
commonest custom, but in the kemmerhouses of towns and cities groups may
form and intercourse take place promiscuously among the males and
females of the group. The furthest extreme from this practice is the
custom of vowing kemmering (Karh. oskyommer), which is to all intents
and purposes monogamous marriage. It has no legal status, but socially
and ethically is an ancient and vigorous institution. The whole
structure of the Karhidish Clan-Hearths and Domains is indubitably based
upon the institution of monogamous marriage. I am not sure of divorce
rules in general; here in Osnoriner there is divorce, but no remarriage
after either divorce or the partner’s death: one can only vow kemmering
once.</p>
<p>Descent of course is reckoned, all over Gethen, from the mother, the
“parent in the flesh” (Karh. amha ).</p>
<p>Incest is permitted, with various restrictions, between siblings,
even the full siblings of a vowed-kemmering pair. Siblings are not
however allowed to vow kemmering, nor keep kemmering after the birth of
a child to one of the pair. Incest between generations is strictly
forbidden (in Karhide/Orgoreyn; but is said to be permitted among the
tribesmen of Perunter, the Antarctic Continent. This may be
slander.).</p>
<p>What else have I learned for certain? That seems to sum it up.</p>
<p>There is one feature of this anomalous arrangement that might have
adaptive value. Since coitus takes place only during the period of
fertility, the chance of conception is high, as with all mammals that
have an estrous cycle. In harsh conditions where infant mortality is
great, a race survival value may be indicated. At present neither infant
mortality nor the birthrate runs high in the civilized areas of Gethen.
Tinibossol estimates a population of not over 100 million on the three
continents, and considers it to have been stable for at least a
millennium. Ritual and ethical abstention and the use of contraceptive
drugs seem to have played the major part in maintaining this
stability.</p>
<p>There are aspects of ambisexuality which we have only glimpsed or
guessed at, and which we may never grasp entirely. The kemmer phenomenon
fascinates all of us Investigators, of course. It fascinates us, but it
rules the Gethenians, dominates them. The structure of their societies,
the management of their industry, agriculture, commerce, the size of
their settlements, the subjects of their stories, everything is shaped
to fit the somer-kemmer cycle. Everybody has his holiday once a month;
no one, whatever his position, is obliged or forced to work when in
kemmer. No one is barred from the kemmerhouse, however poor or strange.
Everything gives way before the recurring torment and festivity of
passion. This is easy for us to understand. What is very hard for us to
understand is that, four-fifths of the time, these people are not
sexually motivated at all. Room is made for sex, plenty of room; but a
room, as it were, apart. The society of Gethen, in its daily functioning
and in its continuity, is without sex.</p>
<p>Consider: Anyone can turn his hand to anything. This sounds very
simple, but its psychological effects are incalculable. The fact that
everyone between seventeen and thirty-five or so is liable to be (as Nim
put it) “tied down to childbearing,” implies that no one is quite so
thoroughly “tied down” here as women, elsewhere, are likely to
be-psychologically or physically. Burden and privilege are shared out
pretty equally; everybody has the same risk to run or choice to make.
Therefore nobody here is quite so free as a free male anywhere else.</p>
<p>Consider: A child has no psycho-sexual relationship to his mother and
father. There is no myth of Oedipus on Winter.</p>
<p>Consider: There is no unconsenting sex, no rape. As with most mammals
other than man, coitus can be performed only by mutual invitation and
consent; otherwise it is not possible. Seduction certainly is possible,
but it must have to be awfully well timed.</p>
<p>Consider: There is no division of humanity into strong and weak
halves, protective/protected, dominant/submissive, owner/chattel,
active/passive. In fact the whole tendency to dualism that pervades
human thinking may be found to be lessened, or changed, on Winter.</p>
<p>The following must go into my finished Directives: When you meet a
Gethenian you cannot and must not do what a bisexual naturally does,
which is to cast him in the role of Man or Woman, while adopting towards
him a corresponding role dependent on your expectations of the patterned
or possible interactions between persons of the same or the opposite
sex. Our entire pattern of socio-sexual interaction is nonexistent here.
They cannot play the game. They do not see one another as men or women.
This is almost impossible for our imagination to accept. What is the
first question we ask about a newborn baby?</p>
<p>Yet you cannot think of a Gethenian as “it.” They are not neuters.
They are potentials, or integrals. Lacking the Karhidish “human pronoun”
used for persons in somer, I must say “he,” for the same reasons as we
used the masculine pronoun in referring to a transcendent god: it is
less defined, less specific, than the neuter or the feminine. But the
very use of the pronoun in my thoughts leads me continually to forget
that the Karhider I am with is not a man, but a manwoman.</p>
<p>The First Mobile, if one is sent, must be warned that unless he is
very self-assured, or senile, his pride will suffer. A man wants his
virility regarded, a woman wants her femininity appreciated, however
indirect and subtle the indications of regard and appreciation. On
Winter they will not exist. One is respected and judged only as a human
being. It is an appalling experience.</p>
<p>Back to my theory. Contemplating the motives for such an experiment,
if such it was, and trying perhaps to exculpate our Hainish ancestors
from the guilt of barbarism, of treating lives as things, I have made
some guesses as to what they might have been after.</p>
<p>The somer-kemmer cycle strikes us as degrading, a return to the
estrous cycle of the lower mammals, a subjection of human beings to the
mechanical imperative of rut. It is possible that the experimenters
wished to see whether human beings lacking continuous sexual
potentiality would remain intelligent and capable of culture.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the limitation of the sexual drive to a
discontinuous time-segment, and the “equalizing” of it in androgyny,
must prevent, to a large extent, both the exploitation and the
frustration of the drive. There must be sexual frustration (though
society provides as well as it can against it; so long as the social
unit is large enough that more than one person will be in kemmer at one
time, sexual fulfillment is fairly certain), but at least it cannot
build up; it is over when kemmer is over. Fine; thus they are spared
much waste and madness; but what is left, in somer? What is there to
sublimate? What would a society of eunuchs achieve? -But of course they
are not eunuchs, in somer, but rather more comparable to
pre-adolescents: not castrate, but latent.</p>
<p>Another guess concerning the hypothetical experiment’s object: The
elimination of war. Did the Ancient Hainish postulate that continuous
sexual capacity and organized social aggression, neither of which are
attributes of any mammal but man, are cause and effect? Or, like Tumass
Song Angot, did they consider war to be a purely masculine
displacement-activity, a vast Rape, and therefore in their experiment
eliminate the masculinity that rapes and the femininity that is raped?
God knows. The fact is that Gethenians, though highly competitive (as
proved by the elaborate social channels provided for competition for
prestige, etc.) seem not to be very aggressive; at least they apparently
have never yet had what one could call a war. They kill one another
readily by ones and twos; seldom by tens or twenties; never by hundreds
or thousands. Why?</p>
<p>It may turn out to have nothing to do with their androgyne
psychology. There are not very many of them, after all. And there is the
climate. The weather of Winter is so relentless, so near the limit of
tolerability even to them with all their cold-adaptations, that perhaps
they use up their fighting spirit fighting the cold. The marginal
peoples, the races that just get by, are rarely the warriors. And in the
end, the dominant factor in Geth-enian life is not sex or any other
human thing: it is their environment, their cold world. Here man has a
crueler enemy even than himself.</p>
<p>I am a woman of peaceful Chiffewar, and no expert on the attractions
of violence or the nature of war. Someone else will have to think this
out. But I really don’t see how anyone could put much stock in victory
or glory after he had spent a winter on Winter, and seen the face of the
Ice.</p>
