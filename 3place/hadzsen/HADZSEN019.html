<h4 id="on-the-ice">18. On the Ice</h4>
<p>Sometimes as I am falling asleep in a dark, quiet room I have for a
moment a great and treasurable illusion of the past. The wall of a tent
leans up over my face, not visible but audible, a slanting plane of
faint sound: the susurrus of blown snow. Nothing can be seen. The
light-emission of the Chabe stove is cut off, and it exists only as a
sphere of heat, a heart of warmth. The faint dampness and confining
cling of my sleeping-bag; the sound of the snow; barely audible,
Estraven’s breathing as he sleeps; darkness. Nothing else. We are
inside, the two of us, in shelter, at rest, at the center of all things.
Outside, as always, lies the great darkness, the cold, death’s
solitude.</p>
<p>In such fortunate moments as I fall asleep I know beyond doubt what
the real center of my own life is, that time which is past and lost and
yet is permanent, the enduring moment, the heart of warmth.</p>
<p>I am not trying to say that I was happy, during those weeks of
hauling a sledge across an ice-sheet in the dead of winter. I was
hungry, overstrained, and often anxious, and it all got worse the longer
it went on. I certainly wasn’t happy. Happiness has to do with reason,
and only reason earns it. What I was given was the thing you can’t earn,
and can’t keep, and often don’t even recognize at the time; I mean
joy.</p>
<p>I always woke up first, usually before daylight. My metabolic rate is
slightly over the Gethenian norm, as are my height and weight; Estraven
had figured these differences into the food-ration calculations, in his
scrupulous way which one could see as either housewifely or scientific,
and from the start I had hada couple of ounces more food per day than
he. Protests of injustice fell silent before the self-evident justice of
this unequal division. However divided, the share was small. I was
hungry, constantly hungry, daily hungrier. I woke up because I was
hungry.</p>
<p>If it was still dark I turned up the light of the Chabe stove, and
put a pan of ice brought in the night before, now thawed, on the stove
to boil. Estraven meanwhile engaged in his customary fierce and silent
struggle with sleep, as if he wrestled with an angel. Winning, he sat
up, stared at me vaguely, shook his head, and woke. By the time we were
dressed and booted and had the bags rolled up, breakfast was ready: a
mug of boiling hot orsh, and one cube of gichy-michy expanded by hot
water into a sort of small, doughy bun. We chewed slowly, solemnly,
retrieving all dropped crumbs. The stove cooled as we ate. We packed it
up with the pan and mugs, pulled on our hooded overcoats and our
mittens, and crawled out into the open air. The coldness of it was
perpetually incredible. Every morning I had to believe it all over
again. If one had been outside to relieve oneself already, the second
exit was only harder.</p>
<p>Sometimes it was snowing; sometimes the long light of early day lay
wonderfully gold and blue across the miles of ice; most often it was
gray.</p>
<p>We brought the thermometer into the tent with us, nights, and when we
took it outside it was interesting to watch the pointer swing to the
right (Gethenian dials read counterclockwise) almost too fast to follow,
registering a drop of twenty, fifty, eighty degrees, till it stopped
somewhere between zero and -60°.</p>
<p>One of us collapsed the tent and folded it while the other loaded
stove, bags, etc. onto the sledge; the tent was strapped over all, and
we were ready for skis and harness. Little metal was used in our straps
and fittings, but the harnesses had buckles of aluminum alloy, too fine
to fasten with mittens on, which burned in that cold exactly as if they
were redhot. I had to be very careful of my fingers when the temperature
was below minus twenty, especially if the wind blew, for I could pick up
a frostbite amazingly fast. My feet never suffered-and that is a factor
of major importance, in a winter-journey where an hour’s exposure can,
after all, cripple one for a week or for life. Estraven had had to guess
my size and the snowboots he got me were a little large, but extra socks
filled the discrepancy. We put on our skis, got into harness as quick as
possible, bucked and pried and jolted the sledge free if its runners
were frozen in, and set off.</p>
<p>Mornings after heavy snowfall we might have to spend some while
digging out the tent and sledge before we could set off. The new snow
was not hard to shovel away, though it made great impressive drifts
around us, who were, after all, the only impediment for hundreds of
miles, the only thing sticking out above the ice.</p>
<p>We pulled eastward by the compass. The usual direction of the wind
was north to south, off the glacier. Day after day it blew from our left
as we went. The hood did not suffice against that wind, and I wore a
facial mask to protect my nose and left cheek. Even so my left eye froze
shut one day, and I thought I had lost the use of it: even when Estraven
thawed it open with breath and tongue, I could not see with it for some
while, so probably more had been frozen than the lashes. In sunlight
both of us wore the Gethenian slit-screen eyeshields, and neither of us
suffered any snow-blindness. We had small opportunity. The Ice, as
Estraven had said, tends to hold a high-pressure zone above its central
area, where thousands of square miles of white reflect the sunlight. We
were not in this central zone, however, but at best on the edge of it,
between it and the zone of turbulent, deflected, precipitation-laden
storms that it sends continually to torment the subglacial lands. Wind
from due north brought bare, bright weather, but from northeast or
northwest it brought snow, or harrowed up dry fallen snow into blinding,
biting clouds like sand or dust-storms, or else, sinking almost to
nothing, crept in sinuous trails along the surface, leaving the sky
white, the air white, no visible sun, no shadow: and the snow itself,
the Ice, disappeared from under our feet. Around midday we would halt,
and cut and set up a few blocks of ice for a protective wall if the wind
was strong. We heated water to soak a cube of gichy-michy in, and drank
the water hot, sometimes with a bit of sugar melted in it; harnessed up
again and went on. We seldom talked while on the march or at lunch, for
our lips were sore, and when one’s mouth was open the cold got inside,
hurting teeth and throat and lungs; it was necessary to keep the mouth
closed and breathe through the nose, at least when the air was forty or
fifty degrees below freezing. When it went on lower than that, the whole
breathing process was further complicated by the rapid freezing of one’s
exhaled breath; if you didn’t look out your nostrils might freeze
shut,and then to keep from suffocating you would gasp in a lungful of
razors.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions our exhalations freezing instantly made a
tiny crackling noise, like distant firecrackers, and a shower of
crystals: each breath a snowstorm.</p>
<p>We pulled till we were tired out or till it began to grow dark,
halted, set up the tent, pegged down the sledge if there was threat of
high wind, and settled in for the night. On a usual day we would have
pulled for eleven or twelve hours, and made between twelve and eighteen
miles.</p>
<p>It does not seem a very good rate, but then conditions were a bit
adverse. The crust of the snow was seldom right for both skis and
sledge-runners. When it was light and new ’the sledge ran through rather
than over it; when it was partly hardened, the sledge would stick but we
on skis would not, which meant that we were perpetually being pulled up
backward with a jolt; and when it was hard it was often heaped up in
long wind-waves, sastrugi, that in some places ran up to four feet high.
We had to haul the sledge up and over each knife-edged or fantastically
corniced top, then slide her down, and up over the next one: for they
never seemed to run parallel to our course. I had imagined the Gobrin
Ice Plateau to be all one sheet like a frozen pond, but there were
hundreds of miles of it that were rather like an abruptly frozen,
storm-raised sea.</p>
<p>The business of setting up camp, making everything secure, getting
all the clinging snow off one’s outer clothing, and so on, was trying.
Sometimes it did not seem worthwhile. It was so late, so cold, one was
so tired, that it would be much easier to lie down in a sleeping-bag in
the lee of the sledge and not bother with the tent. I remember how clear
this was to me on certain evenings, and how bitterly I resented my
companion’s methodical, tyrannical insistence that we do everything and
do it correctly and thoroughly. I hated him at such times, with a hatred
that rose straight up out of the death that lay within my spirit. I
hated the harsh, intricate, obstinate demands that he made on me in the
name of life. When all was done we could enter the tent, and almost at
once the heat of the Chabe stove could be felt as an enveloping,
protecting ambiance. A marvelous thing surrounded us: warmth. Death and
cold were elsewhere, outside.</p>
<p>Hatred was also left outside. We ate and drank. After we ate, we
talked. When the cold was extreme, even the excellent insulation of the
tent could not keep it out, and we lay in our bags as close to the stove
as possible. A little fur of frost gathered on the inner surface of the
tent. To open the valve was to let in a draft of cold that instantly
condensed, filling the tent with a swirling mist of fine snow. When
there was blizzard, needles of icy air blew in through the vents,
elaborately protected as they were, and an impalpable dust of snow-motes
fogged the air. On those nights the storm made an incredible noise, and
we could not converse by voice, unless we shouted with our heads
together. On other nights it was still, with such a stillness as one
imagines as existing before the stars began to form, or after everything
has perished.</p>
<p>Within an hour after our evening meal Estraven turned the stove down,
if it was feasible to do so, and turned the light-emission off. As he
did so he murmured a short and charming grace of invocation, the only
ritual words I had ever learned of the Handdara: “Praise then darkness
and Creation unfinished,” he said, and there was darkness. We slept. In
the morning it was all to do over. We did it over for fifty days.
Estraven kept up his journal, though during the week son the Ice he
seldom wrote more than a note of the weather and the distance we had
come that day. Among these notes there is occasional mention of his own
thoughts or of some of our conversation, but not a word concerning the
profounder conversation between us which occupied our rest between
dinner and sleep on many nights of the first month on the Ice, while we
still had enough energy to talk, and on certain days that we spent
storm-bound in the tent. I told him that I was not forbidden, but not
expected, to use paraverbal speech on a non-Ally planet, and asked him
to keep what he learned from his own people, at least until I could
discuss what-1 had done with my colleagues on the ship. He assented, and
kept his word. He never said or wrote anything concerning our silent
conversations.</p>
<p>Mindspeech was the only thing I had to give Estraven, out of all my
civilization, my alien reality in which he was so profoundly interested.
I could talk and describe endlessly; but that was all I had to give.
Indeed it may be the only important thing we have to give to Winter. But
I can’t say that gratitude was my motive for infringing on the Law of
Cultural Embargo. I was not paying my debt to him. Such debts remain
owing. Estraven and I had simply arrived at the point where we shared
whatever we had that was worth sharing.</p>
<p>I expect it will turn out that sexual intercourse is possible between
Gethenian double-sexed and Hainish-norm one-sexed human beings, though
such intercourse will inevitably be sterile. It remains to be proved;
Estraven and I proved nothing except perhaps a rather subtler point. The
nearest to crisis that our sexual desires brought us was on a night
early in the journey, our second night up on the Ice. We had spent all
day struggling and back-tracking in the cut-up, crevassed area east of
the Fire-Hills. We were tired that evening but elated, sure that a clear
course would soon open out ahead. But after dinner Estraven grew
taciturn, and cut my talk off short. I said at last after a direct
rebuff, “Harth, I’ve said something wrong again, please tell me what it
is.” He was silent.</p>
<p>“I’ve made some mistake in shifgrethor. I’m sorry; I can’t learn.
I’ve never even really understood the meaning of the word.”</p>
<p>“Shifgrethor? It comes from an old word for shadow.” We were both
silent for a little, and then he looked at me with a direct, gentle
gaze. His face in the reddish light was as soft, as vulnerable, as
remote as the face of a woman who looks at you out of her thoughts and
does not speak.</p>
<p>And I saw then again, and for good, what I had always been afraid to
see, and had pretended not to see in him: that he was a woman as well as
a man. Any need to explain the sources of that fear vanished with the
fear; what I was left with was, at last, acceptance of him as he was.
Until then I had rejected him, refused him his own reality. He had been
quite right to say that he, the only person on Gethen who trusted me,
was the only Gethenian I distrusted. For he was the only one who had
entirely accepted me as a human being: who had liked me personally and
given me entire personal loyalty: and who therefore had demanded of me
an equal degree of recognition, of acceptance. I had not been willing to
give it. I had been afraid to give it. I had not wanted to give my
trust, my friendship to a man who was a woman, a woman who was a
man.</p>
<p>He explained, stiffly and simply, that he was in kem-mer and had been
trying to avoid me, insofar as one of us could avoid the other. “I must
not touch you,” he said, with extreme constraint; saying that he looked
a-way.</p>
<p>I said, “I understand. I agree completely.”</p>
<p>For it seemed to me, and I think to him, that it was from that sexual
tension between us, admitted now and understood, but not assuaged, that
the great and sudden assurance of friendship between us rose: a
friendship so much needed by us both in our exile, and already so well
proved in the days and nights of our bitter journey, that it might as
well be called, now as later, love. But it was from the difference
between us, not from the affinities and likenesses, but from the
difference, that that love came: and it was itself the bridge, the only
bridge, across what divided us. For us to meet sexually would be for us
to meet once more as aliens. We had touched, in the only way we could
touch. We left it at that. I do not know if we were right.</p>
<p>We talked some more that night, and I recall being very hard put to
it to answer coherently when he asked me what women were like. We were
both rather stiff and cautious with each other for the next couple of
days. A profound love between two people involves, after all, the power
and chance of doing profound hurt. It would never have occurred to me
before that night that I could hurt Estraven.</p>
<p>Now that the barriers were down, the limitation, in my terms, of our
converse and understanding seemed intolerable to me. Quite soon, two or
three nights later, I said to my companion as we finished our dinner-a
special treat, sugared kadik-porridge, to celebrate a twenty-mile
run-”Last spring, that night in the Corner Red Dwelling, you said you
wished I’d tell you more about paraverbal speech.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to see if I can teach you how to speak it?”</p>
<p>He laughed. “You want to catch me lying.”</p>
<p>“If you ever lied to me, it was long ago, and in another
country.”</p>
<p>He was an honest person, but rarely a direct one. That tickled him,
and he said, “In another country I may tell you other lies. But I
thought you were forbidden to teach your mind-science to … the natives,
until we join the Ekumen.”</p>
<p>“Not forbidden. It’s not done. I’ll do it, though, if you like. And
if I can. I’m no Educer.”</p>
<p>“There are special teachers of the skill?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Not on Alterra, where there’s a high occurrence of natural
sensitivity, and-they say-mothers mindspeak to their unborn babies. I
don’t know what the babies answer. But most of us have to be taught, as
if it were a foreign language. Or rather as if it were our native
language, but learned very late.”</p>
<p>I think he understood my motive in offering to teach him the skill,
and he wanted very much to learn it. We had a go at it. I recalled what
I could of how I had been educed, at age twelve. I told him to clear his
mind, let it be dark. This he did, no doubt, more promptly and
thoroughly than I ever had done: he was an adept of the Handdara, after
all. Then I mindspoke to him as clearly as I could. No result. We tried
it again. Since one cannot bespeak until one has been bespoken, until
the telepathic potentiality has been sensitized by one clear reception,
I had to get through to him first. I tried for half an hour, till I felt
hoarse of brain. He looked crestfallen. “I thought it would be easy for
me,”-he confessed. We were both tired out, and called the attempt off
for the night.</p>
<p>Our next efforts were no more successful. I tried sending to Estraven
while he slept, recalling what my Educer had told me about the
occurrence of “dream-messages” among pre-telepathic peoples, but it did
not work.</p>
<p>“Perhaps my species lacks the capacity,” he said. “We have enough
rumors and hints to have made up a word for the power, but I don’t know
of any proven instances of telepathy among us.”</p>
<p>“So it was with my people for thousands of years. A few natural
Sensitives, not comprehending their gift, and lacking anyone to receive
from or send to. All the rest latent, if that. You know I told you that
except in the case of the born Sensitive, the capacity, though it has a
physiological basis, is a psychological one, a product of culture, a
side-effect of the use of the mind. Young children, and defectives, and
members of un-evolved or regressed societies, can’t mindspeak. The mind
must exist on a certain plane of complexity first. You can’t build up
amino acids out of hydrogen atoms; a good deal of complexifying has to
take place first: the same situation. Abstract thought, varied social
interaction, intricate cultural adjustments, esthetic and ethical
perception, all of it has to reach a certain level before the
connections can be made-before the potentiality can be touched at
all.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps we Gethenians haven’t attained that level.”</p>
<p>“You’re far beyond it. But luck is involved. As in the creation of
amino acids. … Or to take analogies on the cultural plane-only
analogies, but they illuminate-the scientific method, for instance, the
use of concrete, experimental techniques in science. There are peoples
of the Ekumen who possess a high culture, a complex society,
philosophies, arts, ethics, a high style and a great achievement in all
those fields; and yet they have never learned to weigh a stone
accurately. They can learn how, of course. Only for half a million years
they never did. . . . There are peoples who have no higher mathematics
at all, nothing beyond the simplest applied arithmetic. Every one of
them is capable of understanding the calculus, but not one of them does
or ever has. As a matter of fact, my own people, the Terrans, were
ignorant until about three thousand years ago of the uses of zero.” That
made Estraven blink. “As for Gethen, what I’m curious about is whether
the rest of us may find ourselves to have the capacity for
Foretelling-whether this too is a part of the evolution of the mind-if
you’ll teach us the techniques.”</p>
<p>“You think it a useful accomplishment?”</p>
<p>“Accurate prophecy? Well, of course!-”</p>
<p>“You might have to come to believe that it’s a useless one, in order
to practice it.”</p>
<p>“Your Handdara fascinates me, Harth, but now and then I wonder if it
isn’t simply paradox developed into a way of life….”</p>
<p>We tried mindspeech again. I had never before sent repeatedly to a
total non-receiver. The experience was disagreeable. I began to feel
like an atheist praying. Presently Estraven yawned and said, “I am deaf,
deaf as a rock. We’d better sleep.” I assented. He turned out the light,
murmuring his brief praise of darkness; we burrowed down into our bags,
and within a minute or two he was sliding into sleep as a swimmer slides
into dark water. I felt his sleep as if it were my own: the empathic
bond was there, and once more I bespoke him, sleepily, by his
name-”Therem!”</p>
<p>He sat bolt upright, for his voice rang out above me in the
blackness, loud. “Arek! is that you?”</p>
<p>“No: Genly Ai: I am bespeaking you.”His breath caught. Silence. He
fumbled with the Chabe stove, turned up the light, stared at me with his
dark eyes full of fear. “I dreamed,” he said, “I thought I was at
home-”</p>
<p>“You heard me mindspeak.”</p>
<p>“You called me- It was my brother. It was his voice! heard. He’s
dead. You called me-you called me Therem? I. … This is more terrible
than I had thought.” He shook his head, as a man will do to shake off
nightmare, and then put his face in his hands.</p>
<p>“Harth, I’m very sorry-”</p>
<p>“No, call me by my name. If you can speak inside my skull with a dead
man’s voice then you can call me by my name! Would he have called me
‘Harth’? Oh, I see why there’s no lying in this mindspeech. It is a
terrible thing…. All right. All right, speak to me again.”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>“No. Go on.”</p>
<p>With his fierce, frightened gaze on me I bespoke him:</p>
<p>”Therem, my friend, there’s nothing to fear between us.”</p>
<p>He kept on staring at me, so that I thought he had not understood;
but he had. “Ah, but there is,” he said.</p>
<p>After a while, controlling himself, he said calmly, “You spoke in my
language.”</p>
<p>“Well, you don’t know mine.”</p>
<p>“You said there would be words, I know. . . . Yet I imagined it as-an
understanding-”</p>
<p>“Empathy’s another game, though not unconnected. It gave us the
connection tonight. But in mindspeech proper, the speech centers of the
brain are activated, as well as-”</p>
<p>“No, no, no. -Tell me that later. Why do you speak in my brother’s
voice?” His voice was strained.</p>
<p>“That I can’t answer. I don’t know. Tell me about him.”</p>
<p>“Nusuth. . . .My full brother, Arek Harth rem ir Es-traven. He was a
year older than I. He would have been Lord of Estre. We … I left home,
you know, for his sake. He has been dead fourteen years.”</p>
<p>We were both silent for some time. I could not know,or ask, what lay
behind his words: it had cost him too much to say the little he had
said.</p>
<p>I said at last, “Bespeak me, Therem. Call me by my name.” I knew he
could: the rapport was there, or as the experts have it, the phases were
consonant, and of course he had as yet no idea of how to raise the
barrier voluntarily. Had I been a Listener, I could have heard him
think.</p>
<p>“No,” he said. “Never. Not yet….”</p>
<p>But no amount of shock, awe, terror could restrain that insatiable,
outreaching mind for long. After he had cut out the light again I
suddenly heard his stammer in my inward hearing - “Genry-” Even
mindspeaking he never could say “l” properly.</p>
<p>I replied-at once. In the dark he made an inarticulate sound of fear
that had in it a slight edge of satisfaction. “No more, no more,” he
said aloud. After a while we got to sleep at last.</p>
<p>It never came easy to him. Not that he lacked the gift or could not
develop the skill, but it disturbed him profoundly, and he could not
take it for granted. He quickly learned to set up the barriers, but I’m
not sure he felt he could count on them. Perhaps all of us were so, when
the first Educers came back centuries ago from Rokanon’s World teaching
the “Last Art” to us. Perhaps a Gethenian, being singularly complete,
feels telepathic speech as a violation of completeness, a breach of
integrity hard for him to tolerate. Perhaps it was Estraven’s own
character, in which candor and reserve were both strong: every word he
said rose out of a deeper silence. He heard my voice bespeaking him as a
dead man’s, his brother’s voice. I did not know what, besides love and
death, lay between him and that brother, but I knew that whenever I
bespoke him something in him winced away as if I touched awound. So that
intimacy of mind established between us was a bond, indeed, but an
obscure and austere one, not so much admitting further light (as I had
expected it to) as showing the extent of the darkness.</p>
<p>And day alter day we crept on eastward over the plain of ice. The
midpoint in time of our journey as planned, the thirty-fifth day, Odorny
Anner, found us far short of our halfway point in space. By the
sledge-meter we had indeed traveled about four hundred miles, but
probably only three-quarters of that was real forward gain, and we could
estimate only very roughly how far still remained to go. We had spent
days, miles, rations in our long struggle to get up onto the Ice.
Estraven was not so worried as I by the hundreds of miles that still lay
ahead of us. “The sledge is lighter,” he said. “Towards the end it will
be still lighter; and we can cut rations, if necessary. We have been
eating very well, you know.”</p>
<p>I thought he was being ironic, but I should have known better.</p>
<p>On the fortieth day and the two succeeding we were snowed in by a
blizzard. During these long hours of lying blotto in the tent Estraven
slept almost continuously, and ate nothing, though he drank orsh or
sugar-water at mealtimes. He insisted that I eat, though only
half-rations. “You have no experience in starvation,” he said.</p>
<p>I was humiliated. “How much have you-Lord of a Domain, and Prime
Minister-?”</p>
<p>“Genry, we practice privation until we’re experts at it. I was taught
how to starve as a child at home in Estre, and by the Handdarata in
Rotherer Fastness. I got out of practice in Erhenrang, true enough, but
I began making up for it in Mishnory. . . . Please do as I say, my
friend; I know what I’m doing.”</p>
<p>He did, and I did.</p>
<p>We went on for four more days of very bitter cold, never above -25°,
and then came another blizzard whooping up in our faces from the east on
a gale wind. Within two minutes of the first strong gusts the snow blew
so thick that I could not see Estraven six feet away. I had turned my
back on him and the sledge and the plastering, blinding, suffocating
snow in order to get my breath, and when a minute later I turned around
he was gone. The sledge was gone. Nothing was there. I took a few steps
to where they had been and felt about. I shouted,* and could not hear my
own voice. I was deaf and alone in a universe filled solid with small
stinging gray streaks. I panicked and began to blunder forward,
mindcalling frantically, “Therem!”</p>
<p>Right under my hand, kneeling, he said, “Come on, give me a hand with
the tent.”</p>
<p>I did so, and never mentioned my minute of panic. No need to.</p>
<p>This blizzard lasted two days; there were five days lost, and there
would be more. Nimmer and Anner are the months of the great storms.</p>
<p>“We’re beginning to cut it rather fine, aren’t we,” I said one night
as I measured out our gichy-michy ration and put it to soak in hot
water.</p>
<p>He looked at me. His firm, broad face showed weight-loss in deep
shadows under the cheekbones, his eyes were sunken and his mouth sorely
chapped and cracked. God knows what I looked like, when he looked like
that. He smiled. “With luck we shall make it, and without luck we shall
not.”</p>
<p>It was what he had said from the start. With all my anxieties, my
sense of taking a last desperate gamble, and so on, I had not been
realistic enough to believe him. Even now I thought, Surely when we’ve
worked so hard-</p>
<p>But the Ice did not know how hard we worked. Why should it?
Proportion is kept.</p>
<p>“How is your luck running, Therem?” I said at last.</p>
<p>He did not smile at that. Nor did he answer. Only after a while he
said, “I’ve been thinking about them all, down there.” Down there ,for
us, had come to mean the south, the world below the plateau of ice, the
region of earth, men, roads, cities, all of which had become hard to
imagine as really existing. “You know that I sent word to the king
concerning you, the day I left Mishnory. I told him what Shusgis told
me, that you were going to be sent to Pulefen Farm. At the time I wasn’t
clear as to my intent, but merely followed my impulse. I have thought
the impulse through, since. Something like this may happen: The king
will see a chance to play shifgrethor. Tibe will advise against it, but
Arga-ven should be growing a little tired of Tibe by now, and may ignore
his counsel. He will inquire. Where is the Envoy, the guest of Karhide?
-Mishnory will lie. He died of horm-fever this autumn, most lamentable.
-Then how does it happen that we are informed by our own Embassy that
he’s in Pulefen Farm? -He’s not there, look for yourselves. -No, no, of
course not, we accept the word of the Commensals of Orgoreyn. . . . But
a few weeks after these exchanges, the Envoy appears in North Karhide,
having escaped from Pulefen Farm. Consternation in Mishnory, indignation
in Erhenrang. Loss of face for the Commensals, caught lying. You will be
a treasure, a long-lost hearth-brother, to King Argaven, Genry. For a
while. You must send for your Star Ship at once, at the first chance you
get. Bring your people to Karhide and accomplish your mission, at once,
before Argaven has had time to see the possible enemy in you, before
Tibe or some other councillor frightens him once more, playing on his
madness. If he makes the bargain with you, he will keep it. To break it
would be to break his own shifgrethor. The Harge kings keep their
promises. But you must act fast, and bring the Ship down soon.”</p>
<p>“I will, if I receive the slightest sign of welcome.”</p>
<p>“No: forgive my advising you, but you must not wait for welcome. You
will be welcomed, I think. So will the Ship. Karhide has been sorely
humbled this past half-year. You will give Argaven the chance to turn
the tables. I think he will take the chance.”</p>
<p>“Very well. But you, meanwhile-”</p>
<p>“I am Estraven the Traitor. I have nothing whatever to do with
you.”</p>
<p>“At first.”</p>
<p>“At first,” he agreed.</p>
<p>“You’ll be able to hide out, if there is danger at first?”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, certainly.”</p>
<p>Our food was ready, and we fell to. Eating was so important and
engrossing a business that we never talked any more while we ate; the
taboo was now in its complete, perhaps its original form, not a word
said till the last crumb was gone. When it was, he said, “Well, I hope
I’ve guessed well. You will . . . you do forgive…”</p>
<p>“Your giving me direct advice?” I said, for there were certain things
I had finally come to understand. “Of course I do, Therein. Really, how
can you doubt it? You know I have no shifgrethor to waive.” That amused
him, but he was still brooding.</p>
<p>“Why,” he said at last, “why did you come alone-why were you sent
alone? Everything, still, will depend upon that ship coming. Why was it
made so difficult for you, and for us?”</p>
<p>“It’s the Ekumen’s custom, and there are reasons for it. Though in
fact I begin to wonder if I’ve ever understood the reasons. I thought it
was for your sake that I came alone, so obviously alone, so vulnerable,
that I could in myself pose no threat, change no balance: not an
invasion, but a mere messenger-boy. But there’s more to it than that.
Alone, I cannot change your world. But I can be changed by it. Alone, I
must listen, as well as speak. Alone, the relationship I finally make,
if I make one, is not impersonal and not only political: it is
individual, it is personal, it is both more and less than political. Not
We and They; not I and It; but I and Thou. Not political, not pragmatic,
but mystical. In a certain sense the Ekumen is not a body politic, but a
body mystic. It considers beginnings to be extremely important.
Beginnings, and means. Its doctrine is just the reverse of the doctrine
that the end justifies the means. It proceeds, therefore, by subtle
ways, and slow ones, and queer, risky ones; rather as evolution does,
which is in certain senses its model. … So I was sent alone, for your
sake? Or for my own? I don’t know. Yes, it has made things difficult.
But I might ask you as profitably why you’ve never seen fit to invent
airborne vehicles? One small stolen airplane would have spared you and
me a great deal of difficulty!”</p>
<p>“How would it ever occur to a sane man that he could fly?” Estraven
said sternly. It was a fair response, on a world where no living thing
is winged, and the very angels of the Yomesh Hierarchy of the Holy do
not fly but only drift, wingless, down to earth like a soft snow
falling, like the windborne seeds of that flowerless world.</p>
<p>Towards the middle of Nimmer, after much wind and bitter cold, we
came into a quiet weather for many days. If there was storm it was far
south of us, down there, and we inside the blizzard had only an all but
windless overcast. At first the overcast was thin, so that the air was
vaguely radiant with an even, sourceless sunlight reflected from both
clouds and snow, from above and below. Overnight the weather thickened
somewhat. All brightness was gone, leaving nothing. We stepped out of
the tent onto nothing. Sledge and tent were there, Estraven stood beside
me, but neither he nor I cast any shadow. There was dull light all
around, everywhere. When we walked on the crisp snow no shadow showed
the footprint. We left no track. Sledge, tent, himself, myself: nothing
else at all. No sun, no sky, no horizon, no world. A whitish-gray void,
in which we appeared to hang. The illusion was so complete that I had
trouble keeping my balance. My inner ears were used to confirmation from
my eyes as to how I stood; they got none; I might as well be blind. It
was all right while we loaded up, but hauling, with nothing ahead,
nothing to look at, nothing for the eye to touch, as it were, it was at
first disagreeable and then exhausting. We were on skis, on a good
surface of firn, without sastrugi, and solid-that was certain-for five
or six thousand feet down. We should have been making good time. But we
kept slowing down, groping our way across the totally unobstructed
plain, and it took a strong effort of will to speed up to a normal pace.
Every slight variation in the surface came as a jolt-as in climbing
stairs, the unexpected stair or the expected but absent stair-for we
could not see it ahead: there was no shadow to show it. We skied blind
with our eyes open. Day after day was like this, and we began to shorten
our hauls, for by mid-afternoon both of us would be sweating and shaking
with strain and fatigue. I came to long for snow, for blizzard, for
anything; but morning after morning we came out of the tent into the
void, the white weather, what Estraven called the Un-shadow.</p>
<p>One day about noon, Odorny Nimmer, the sixty-first day of the
journey, that bland blind nothingness about us began to flow and writhe.
I thought my eyes were fooling me, as they had been doing often, and
paid scant attention to the dim meaningless commotion of the air until,
suddenly, I caught a glimpse of a small, wan, dead sun overhead. And
looking down from the sun, straight ahead, I saw a huge black shape come
hulking out of the void towards us. Black tentacles writhed upwards,
groping out. I stopped dead in my tracks, slewing Estraven around on his
skis, for we were both in harness hauling. “What is it?”</p>
<p>He stared at the dark monstrous forms hidden in the fog, and said at
last, “The crags. … It must be Esherhoth Crags.” And pulled on. We were
miles from the things, which I had taken to be almost within arm’s
reach. As the white weather turned to a thick low mist and then cleared
off, we saw them plainly before sunset: nunataks, great scored and
ravaged pinnacles of rock jutting up out of the ice, no more of them
showing than shows of an iceberg above the sea: cold drowned mountains,
dead for eons.</p>
<p>They showed us to be somewhat north of our shortest course, if we
could trust the ill-drawn map that was all we had. The next day we
turned for the first time a little south of east.</p>
