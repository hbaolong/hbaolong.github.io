<h4 id="conversations-in-mishnory">10. Conversations in Mishnory</h4>
<p>Next morning as I finished a late breakfast served to me in my suite
in Shusgis’ mansion the house-phone emitted a polite bleat. When I
switched it on, the caller spoke in Karhidish: “Therein Harth here. May
I come up?”</p>
<p>“Please do.”</p>
<p>I was glad to get the confrontation over with at once. It was plain
that no tolerable relationship could exist between Estraven and myself.
Even though his disgrace and exile were at least nominally on my
account, I could take no responsibility for them, feel no rational
guilt; he had made neither his acts nor his motives clear to me in
Erhenrang, and I could not trust the fellow. I wished that he was not
mixed up with these Orgota who had, as it were, adopted me. His presence
was a complication and an embarrassment.</p>
<p>He was shown into the room by one of the many house-employees. I had
him sit down in one of the large padded chairs, and offered him
breakfast-ale. He refused. His manner was not constrained-he had left
shyness a long way behind him if he ever had any-but it was restrained:
tentative, aloof.</p>
<p>“The first real snow,” he said, and seeing my glance at the heavily
curtained window, “You haven’t looked out yet?”</p>
<p>I did so, and saw snow whirling thick on a light wind down the
street, over the whitened roofs; two or three inches had fallen in the
night. It was Odarhad Gor, the 17th of the first month of autumn. “It’s
early,” I said, caught by the snow-spell for a moment.</p>
<p>“They predict a hard winter this year.”</p>
<p>I left the curtains drawn back. The bleak even light from outside
fell on his dark face. He looked older. He had known some hard times
since I saw him last in the Corner Red Dwelling of the Palace in
Erhenrang by his own fireside.</p>
<p>“I have here what I was asked to bring you,” I said, and gave him the
foilskin-wrapped packet of money, which I had set out on a table ready
after his call. He took it and thanked me gravely. I had not sat down.
After a moment, still holding the packet, he stood up.</p>
<p>My conscience itched a little, but I did not scratch it. I wanted to
discourage him from coming to me. That this involved humiliating him was
unfortunate.</p>
<p>He looked straight at me. He was shorter than I, of course,
short-legged and compact, not as tall even as many women of my race. Yet
when he looked at me he did not seem to be looking up at me. I did not
meet his eyes. I examined the radio on the table with a show of
abstracted interest.</p>
<p>“One can’t believe everything one hears on that radio, here,” he said
pleasantly. “Yet it seems to me that here in Mishnory you are going to
be in some need of information, and advice.”</p>
<p>“There seem to be a number of people quite ready to supply it.”</p>
<p>“And there’s safety in numbers, eh? Ten are more trustworthy than
one. Excuse me, I shouldn’t use Karhidishhuhuth, I forgot.” He went on
in Orgota, “Banished men should never speak their native tongue; it
comes bitter from their mouth. And this language suits a traitor better,
I think; drips off one’s teeth like sugar-syrup. Mr. Ai, I have the
right to thank you. You performed a service both for me and for my old
friend and kemmering Ashe Foreth, and in his name and mine I claim my
right. My thanks take the form of advice.” He paused; I said nothing. I
had never heard him use this sort of harsh, elaborate courtesy, and had
no idea what it signified. He went on, “You are, in Mishnory, what you
were not, in Erhenrang. There they said you were; here they’ll say
you’re not. You are the tool of a faction. I advise you to be careful
how you let them use you. I advise you to find out what the enemy
faction is, and who they are, and never to let them use you, for they
will not use you well.”</p>
<p>He stopped. I was about to demand that he be more specific, but he
said, “Goodbye, Mr. Ai,” turned, and left. I stood benumbed. The man was
like an electric shock-nothing to hold on to and you don’t know what hit
you.</p>
<p>He had certainly spoiled the mood of peaceful self-congratulation in
which I had eaten breakfast. I went to the narrow window and looked out.
The snow had thinned a little. It was beautiful, drifting in white clots
and clusters like a fall of cherry-petals in the orchards of my home,
when a spring wind blows down the green slopes of Borland, where I was
born: on Earth, warm Earth, where trees bear flowers in spring. All at
once I was utterly downcast and homesick. Two years I had spent on this
damned planet, and the third winter had begun before autumn was
underway-months and months of unrelenting cold, sleet, ice, wind, rain,
snow, cold, cold inside, cold outside, cold to the bone and the marrow
of the bone. And all that time on my own, alien and isolate, without a
soul I could trust. Poor Genly, shall we cry? I saw Estraven come out of
the house onto the street below me, a dark foreshortened figure in the
even, vague gray-white of the snow. He looked about, adjusting the loose
belt of his hieb-he wore no coat. He set off down the street, walking
with a deft, definite grace, a quickness of being that made him seem in
that minute the only thing alive in all Mishnory.</p>
<p>I turned back to the warm room. Its comforts were stuffy and
cloddish, the heater, the padded chairs, the bed piled with furs, the
rugs, drapes, wrappings, muffling.</p>
<p>I put on my winter coat and went out for a walk, in a disagreeable
mood, in a disagreeable world.</p>
<p>I was to lunch that day with Commensals Obsle and Yegey and others I
had met the night before, and to be introduced to some I had not met.
Lunch is usually served from a buffet and eaten standing up, perhaps so
that one will not feel he has spent the entire day sitting at table. For
this formal affair, however, places were set at table, and the buffet
was enormous, eighteen or twenty hot and cold dishes, mostly variations
on sube-eggs and breadapple. At the sideboard, before the taboo on
conversation applied, Obsle remarked to me while loading up his plate
with batter-fried sube-eggs, “The fellow named Mersen is a spy from
Erhenrang, and Gaum there is an open agent of the Sarf, you know.” He
spoke conversationally, laughed as if I had made an amusing reply, and
moved off to the pickled blackfish.</p>
<p>I had no idea what the Sarf was.</p>
<p>As people were beginning to sit down a young fellow came in and spoke
to the host, Yegey, who then turned to us. “News from Karhide,” he said.
“King Argaven’s child was born this morning, and died within the
hour.”</p>
<p>There was a pause, and a buzz, and then the handsome man called Gaum
laughed and lifted up his beer-tankard. “May all the Kings of Karhide
live as long!” he cried. Some drank the toast with him, most did not.
“Name of Meshe, to laugh at a child’s death,” said a fat old man in
purple sitting heavily down beside me, his leggings bunched around his
thighs like skirts, his face heavy with disgust</p>
<p>Discussion arose as to which of his kemmering-sons Argaven might name
as his heir-for he was well over forty and would now surely have no
child of his flesh- and how long he might leave Tibe as Regent. Some
thought the regency would be ended at once, others were dubious. “What
do you think, Mr. Ai?” asked the man called Mersen, whom Obsle had
identified as a Karhidish agent, and thus presumably one of Tibe’s own
men. “You’ve just come from Erhenrang, what are they saying there about
these rumors that Argaven has in fact abdicated without announcement,
handed the sledge over to his cousin?”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve heard the rumor, yes.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s got any foundation?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea,” I said, and at this point the host intervened with
a mention of the weather; for people had begun to eat.</p>
<p>After servants had cleared away the plates and the mountainous
wreckage of roasts and pickles from the buffet, we all sat on around the
long table; small cups of a fierce liquor were served, lifewater they
called it, as men often do; and they asked me questions.</p>
<p>Since my examination by the physicians and scientists of Erhenrang I
had not been faced with a group of people who wanted me to answer their
questions. Few Karhiders, even the fishermen and farmers with whom I had
spent my first months, had been willing to satisfy their curiosity-which
was often intense-by simply asking. They were involute, introvert,
indirect; they did not like questions and answers. I though of
Other-herd Fastness, of what Faxe the Weaver had said concerning
answers. . . . Even the experts had limited their questions to strictly
physiological subjects, such as the glandular and circulatory functions
in which I differed most notably from the Gethenian norm. They had never
gone on to ask, for example, how the continuous sexuality of my race
influenced its social institutions, how we handled our “permanent
kemmer.” They listened, when I told them; the psychologists listened
when I told them about mindspeech; but not one of them had brought
himself to ask enough general questions to form any adequate picture of
Terran or Ekumenical society-except, perhaps, Estraven.</p>
<p>Here they weren’t quite so tied up by considerations of everybody’s
prestige and pride, and questions evidently were not insulting either to
the asker or the one questioned. However I soon saw that some of the
questioners were out to catch me, to prove me a fraud. That threw me off
balance a minute. I had of course met with incredulity in Karhide, but
seldom with a will to incredulity. Tibe had put on an elaborate show of
going-along-with-the-hoax, the day of the parade in Erhenrang, but as I
now knew that was part of the game he had played to discredit Estraven,
and I guessed that Tibe did in fact believe me. He had seen my ship,
after all, the little lander that had brought me down on planet; he had
free access along with anyone else to the engineers’ reports on the ship
and the ansible. None of these Orgota had seen the ship. I could show
them the ansible, but it didn’t make a very convincing Alien Artifact,
being so incomprehensible as to fit in with hoax as well as with
reality. The old Law of Cultural Embargo stood against the importation
of analyzable, imitable artifacts at this stage, and so I had nothing
with me except the ship and ansible, my box of pictures, the indubitable
peculiarity of my body, and the unprovable singularity of my mind. The
pictures passed around the table, and were examined with the
noncommittal expression you see on the faces of people looking at
pictures of somebody else’s family. The questioning continued. What,
asked Obsle, was the Ekumen - a world, a league of worlds, a place, a
government?</p>
<p>“Well, all of those and none. Ekumen is our Terran word; in the
common tongue it’s called the Household; in Karhidish it would be the
Hearth. In Orgota I’m not sure, I don’t know the language well enough
yet. Not the Commensality, I think, though there are undoubtedly
similarities between the Commensal Government and the Ekumen. But the
Ekumen is not essentially a government at all. It is an attempt to
reunify the mystical with the political, and as such is of course mostly
a failure; but its failure has done more good for humanity so far than
the successes of its predecessors. It is a society and it has, at least
potentially, a culture. It is a form of education; in one aspect it’s a
sort of very large school-very large indeed. The motives of
communication and cooperation are of its essence, and therefore in
another aspect it’s a league or union of worlds, possessing some degree
of centralized conventional organization. It’s this aspect, the League,
that I now represent. The Ekumen as a political entity functions through
coordination, not by rule. It does not enforce laws; decisions are
reached by council and consent, not by consensus or command. As an
economic entity it is immensely active, looking after interworld
communication, keeping the balance of trade among the Eighty Worlds.
Eighty-four, to be precise, if Gethen enters the Ekumen. . . .”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, it doesn’t enforce its laws?” said Slose.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t any. Member states follow their own laws; when they clash
the Ekumen mediates, attempts to make a legal or ethical adjustment or
collation or choice. Now if the Ekumen, as an experiment in the
superorganic, does eventually fail, it will have to become a
peace-keeping force, develop a police, and so on. But at this point
there’s no need. All the central worlds are still recovering from a
disastrous era a couple of centuries ago, reviving lost skills and lost
ideas, learning how to talk again. . . .” How could I explain the Age of
the Enemy, and its aftereffects, to a people who had no word for
war?</p>
<p>“This is absolutely fascinating, Mr. Ai,” said the host, Commensal
Yegey, a delicate, dapper, drawling fellow with keen eyes. “But I can’t
see what they’d want with us. I mean to say, what particular good is an
eighty-fourth world to them? And not, I take it, a very clever world,
for we don’t have Star Ships and so on, as they all do.”</p>
<p>“None of us did, until the Hainish and the Cetians arrived. And some
worlds still weren’t allowed to, for centuries, until the Ekumen
established the canons for what I think you here call Open Trade.” That
got a laugh all around, for it was the name of Yegey’s party or faction
within the Commensality. “Open trade is really what I’m here to try to
set up. Trade not only in goods, of course, but in knowledge,
technologies, ideas, philosophies, art, medicine, science, theory … I
doubt that Gethen would ever do much physical coming-and-going to the
other worlds. We are seventeen light-years here from the nearest
Ekumenical World, Ollul, a planet of the star you call Asyomse; the
farthest is two hundred and fifty light-years away and you cannot even
see its star. With the ansible communicator, you could talk with that
world as if by radio with the next town. But I doubt you’d ever meet any
people from it. … The kind of trade I speak of can be highly profitable,
but it consists largely of simple communication rather than of
transportation. My job here is, really, to find out if you’re willing to
communicate with the rest of mankind.”</p>
<p>“ ‘You,’ “ Slose repeated, leaning forward intensely: “Does that mean
Orgoreyn? or does it mean Gethen as a whole?”</p>
<p>I hesitated a moment, for it was not -the question I had
expected.</p>
<p>“Here and now, it means Orgoreyn. But the contract cannot be
exclusive. If Sith, or the Island Nations, or Karhide decide to enter
the Ekumen, they may. It’s a matter of individual choice each time. Then
what generally happens, on a planet as highly developed as Gethen, is
that the various anthrotypes or regions or nations end up by
establishing a set of representatives to function as coordinator on the
planet and with the other planets-a local Stability, in our terms. A lot
of time is saved by beginning this way; and money, by sharing the
expense. If you decided to set up a starship of your own, for
instance.”</p>
<p>“By the milk of Meshe!” said fat Humery beside me. “You want us to go
shooting off into the Void? Ugh!” He wheezed, like the high notes of an
accordion, in disgust and amusement.</p>
<p>Gaum spoke: “Where is your ship, Mr. Ai?” He put the question softly,
half-smiling, as if it were extremely subtle and he wished the subtlety
to be noticed. He was a most extraordinarily handsome human being, by
any standards and as either sex, and I couldn’t help staring at him as I
answered, and also wondered again what the Sarf was. “Why, that’s no
secret; it was talked about a good bit on the Karhidish radio. The
rocket that landed me on Horden Island is now in the Royal Workshop
Foundry in the Artisan School; most of it, anyway; I think various
experts went off with various bits of it after they’d examined it.”</p>
<p>“Rocket?” inquired Humery, for I had used the Orgota word for
firecracker.-</p>
<p>“It succinctly describes the method of propulsion of the landing
boat, sir.”</p>
<p>Humery wheezed some more. Gaum merely smiled, saying, “Then you have
no means of returning to … well, wherever you came from?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes. I could speak to Ollul by ansible and ask them to send a
NAFAL ship to pick me up. It would get here in seventeen years. Or I
could radio to the starship that brought me into your solar system. It’s
in orbit around your sun now. It would get here in a matter of
days.”</p>
<p>The sensation that caused was visible and audible, and even Gaum
couldn’t hide his surprise. There was some discrepancy here. This was
the one major fact I had kept concealed in Karhide, even from Estraven.
If, as I had been given to understand, the Orgota knew about me only
what Karhide had chosen to tell them, then this should have been only
one among many surprises. But it wasn’t. It was the big one.</p>
<p>“Where is this ship, sir?” Yegey demanded.</p>
<p>“Orbiting the sun, somewhere between Gethen and Kuhurn.”</p>
<p>“How did you get from it to here?”</p>
<p>“By the firecracker,” said old Humery.</p>
<p>“Precisely. We don’t land an interstellar ship on a populated planet
until open communication or alliance is established. So I came in on a
little rocket-boat, and landed on Horden Island.”</p>
<p>“And you can get in touch with the-with the big ship by ordinary
radio, Mr. Ai?” That was Obsle.</p>
<p>“Yes,” I omitted mention for the present of my little relay
satellite, set into orbit from the rocket; I did not want to give them
the impression that their sky was full of my junk. “It would take a
fairly powerful transmitter, but you have plenty of those.”</p>
<p>“Then we could radio your ship?”</p>
<p>“Yes, if you had the proper signal. The people aboard are in a
condition we call stasis, hibernation you might say, so that they won’t
lose out of their lives the years they spend waiting for me to get my
business done down here. The proper signal on the proper wavelength will
set machinery in motion which will bring them out of stasis; after which
they’ll consult with me by radio, or by ansible using Ollul as
relay-center.”</p>
<p>Someone asked uneasily, “How many of them?”</p>
<p>“Eleven.”</p>
<p>That brought a little sound of relief, a laugh. The tension relaxed a
little.</p>
<p>“What if you never signaled?” Obsle asked.</p>
<p>“They’ll come out of stasis automatically, about four years from
now.”</p>
<p>“Would they come here after you, then?”</p>
<p>“Not unless they’d heard from me. They’d consult with the Stabiles on
Ollul and Ham, by ansible. Most likely they’d decide to try again-send
down another person as Envoy. The Second Envoy often finds things easier
than the First. He has less explaining to do, and people are likelier to
believe him….”</p>
<p>Obsle grinned. Most of the others still looked thoughtful and
guarded. Gaum gave me an airy little nod, as if applauding my quickness
to reply: a conspirator’s nod. Slose was staring bright-eyed and tense
at some inner vision, from which he turned abruptly to me. “Why,” he
said, “Mr. Envoy, did you never speak of this other ship, during your
two years in Karhide?”</p>
<p>“How do we know that he didn’t?” said Gaum, smiling.</p>
<p>“We know damned well that he didn’t, Mr. Gaum,” said Yegey, also
smiling.</p>
<p>“I didn’t,” I said. “This is why. The idea of that ship, waiting out
there, can be an alarming one. I think some of you find it so. In
Karhide, I never advanced to a point of confidence with those I dealt
with that allowed me to take the risk of speaking of the ship. Here,
you’ve had longer to think about me; you’re willing to listen to me out
in the open, in public; you’re not so much ruled by fear. I took the
risk because I think the time has come to take it, and that Orgoreyn is
the place.”</p>
<p>“You are right, Mr. Ai, you are right!” Slose said violently. “Within
a month you will send for that ship, and it will be made welcome in
Orgoreyn as the visible sign and seal of the new epoch. Their eyes will
be opened who will not see now!”</p>
<p>It went on, right on till dinner was served to us where we sat. We
ate and drank and went home, I for one worn out, but pleased all in all
with the way things had gone. There were warnings and obscurities, of
course. Slose wanted to make a religion of me. Gaum wanted to make a
sham of me. Mersen seemed to want to prove that he was not a Karhidish
agent by proving^that I was. But Obsle, Yegey, and some others were
working on a higher level. They wanted to communicate with the Stabiles,
and to bring the NAFAL ship down on Orgota ground, in order to persuade
or coerce the Commensality of Orgoreyn to ally itself with the Ekumen.
They believed that in doing so Orgoreyn would gain a large and lasting
prestige-victory over Karhide, and that the Commensals who engineered
this victory would gain according prestige and power in their
government. Their Open Trade faction, a minority in the Thirty-Three,
opposed the continuation of the Sinoth Valley dispute, and in general
represented a conservative, unaggressive, non-nationalistic policy. They
had been out of power for a long time and were calculating that their
way back to power might, with some risks taken, lie on the road I
pointed out. That they saw no farther than that, that my mission was a
means ’to them and not an end, was no great harm. Once they were on the
road, they might begin to get some sense of where it could take them.
Meanwhile, if shortsighted, they were at least realistic.</p>
<p>Obsle, speaking to persuade others, had said, “Either Karhide will
fear the strength this alliance will give us- and Karhide is always
afraid of new ways and new ideas, remember-and so will hang back and be
left behind. Or else the Erhenrang Government will get up their courage
and come and ask to join, after us, in second place. In either case the
shifgrethor of Karhide will be diminished; and in either case, we drive
the sledge. If we have the wits to take this advantage now, it will be a
permanent advantage and a certain one!” Then turning to me, “But the
Ekumen must be willing to help us, Mr. Ai. We have got to have more to
show our people than you alone, one man, already known in
Erhenrang.”</p>
<p>“I see that, Commensal. You’d like a good, showy proof, and I’d like
to offer one. But I cannot bring down the ship until its safety and your
integrity are reasonably secure. I need the consent and the guarantee of
your government, which I take it would mean the whole board of
Commensals - publicly announced.”</p>
<p>Obsle looked dour, but said, “Fair enough.”</p>
<p>Driving home with Shusgis, who had contributed nothing but his jovial
laugh to the afternoon’s business, I asked, “Mr. Shusgis, what is the
Sarf?”</p>
<p>“One of the Permanent Bureaus of the Internal Administration. Looks
out after false registries, unauthorized travel, job-substitutions,
forgeries, that sort of thing-trash. That’s whatsarf means in gutter -
Orgota, trash, it’s a nickname.”</p>
<p>“Then the Inspectors are agents of the Sarf?”</p>
<p>“Well, some are.”</p>
<p>“And the police, I suppose they come under its authority to some
extent?” I put the question cautiously and was answered in kind. “I
suppose so. I’m in the External Administration, of course, and I can’t
keep all the offices straight, over in Internal.”</p>
<p>“They certainly are confusing; now what’s the Waters Office, for
instance?” So I backed off as best I could from the subject of the Sarf.
What Shusgis had not said on the subject might have meant nothing at all
to a man from Hain, say, or lucky Chiffewar; but I was born on Earth. It
is not altogether a bad thing to have criminal ancestors. An arsonist
grandfather may bequeath one a nose for smelling smoke.</p>
<p>It had been entertaining and fascinating to find here on Gethen
governments so similar to those in the ancient histories of Terra: a
monarchy, and a genuine fullblown bureaucracy. This new development was
also fascinating, but less entertaining. It was odd that in the less
primitive society, the more sinister note was struck.</p>
<p>So Gaum, who wanted me to be a liar, was an agent of the secret
police of Orgoreyn. Did he know that Obsle knew him as such? No doubt he
did. Was he then the agent provocateur? Was he nominally working with,
or against, Obsle’s faction? Which of the factions within the Government
of Thirty-Three controlled, or was controlled by, the Sarf? I had better
get these matters straight, but it might not be easy to do so. My
course, which for a while had looked so clear and hopeful, seemed likely
to become as tortuous and beset with secrets as it had been in
Erhenrang. Everything had gone all right, I thought, until Estraven had
appeared shadowlike at my side last night.</p>
<p>“What’s Lord Estraven’s position, here in Mishnory?” I asked Shusgis,
who had settled back as if half asleep in the corner of the
smooth-running car. . “Estraven? Harth, he’s called here, you know. We
don’t have titles in Orgoreyn, dropped all that with the New Epoch.
Well, he’s a dependent of Commensal Yegey’s, I understand.”</p>
<p>“He lives there?”</p>
<p>“I believe so.”</p>
<p>I was about to say that it was odd that he had been at Slose’s last
night and not at Yegey’s today, when I saw that in the light of our
brief morning interview it wasn’t very odd. Yet even the idea that he
was intentionally keeping away made me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“They found him,” said Shusgis, resettling his broad hips on the
cushioned seat, “over in the Southside in a glue factory or a fish
cannery or some such place, and gave him a hand out of the gutter. Some
of the Open Trade crowd, I mean. Of course he was useful to them when he
was in the kyorremy and Prime Minister, so they stand by him now. Mainly
they do it to annoy Mer-sen, I think. Ha, ha! Mersen’s a spy for Tibe,
and of course he thinks nobody knows it but everybody does, and he can’t
stand the sight of Harth-thinks he’s either a traitor or a double agent
and doesn’t know which, and can’t risk shifgrethor in finding out. Ha,
ha!”</p>
<p>“Which do you think Harth is, Mr. Shusgis?”</p>
<p>“A traitor, Mr. Ai. Pure and simple. Sold out his country’s claims in
the Sinoth Valley in order to prevent Tibe’s rise to power, but didn’t
manage it cleverly enough. He’d have met with worse punishment than
exile, here. By Meshe’s tits! If you play against your own side you’ll
lose the whole game. That’s what these fellows with no patriotism, only
self-love, can’t see. Though I don’t suppose Harth much cares where he
is so long as he can keep on wriggling towards some kind of power. He
hasn’t done so badly here, in five months, as you see.”</p>
<p>“Not so badly.”</p>
<p>“You don’t trust him either, eh?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad to hear it, Mr. Ai. I don’t see why Yegey and Obsle hang on
to the fellow. He’s a proven traitor, out for his own profit, and trying
to hang onto your sledge, Mr. Ai, until he can keep himself going.
That’s how I see it. Well, I don’t know that I’d give him any free
rides, if he came asking me for one!” Shusgis puffed and nodded
vigorously in approval of his own opinion, and smiled at me, the smile
of one virtuous man to another. The car ran softly through the wide,
well-lit streets. The morning’s snow was melted except for dingy heaps
along the gutters; it was raining now, a cold, small rain.</p>
<p>The great buildings of central Mishnory, government offices, schools,
Yomesh temples, were so blurred by rain in the liquid glare of the high
streetlights that they looked as if they were melting. Their corners
were vague, their facades streaked, dewed, smeared. There was something
fluid, insubstantial, in the very heaviness of this city built of
monoliths, this monolithic state which called the part and the whole by
the same name. And Shusgis, my jovial host, a heavy man, a substantial
man, he too was somehow, around the corners and edges, a little vague, a
little, just a little bit unreal.</p>
<p>Ever since I had set off by car through the wide golden fields of
Orgoreyn four days ago, beginning my successful progress towards the
inner sanctums of Mishnory, I had been missing something. But what?’I
felt insulated. I had not felt the cold, lately. They kept rooms
decently warm, here. I had not eaten with pleasure, lately. Orgota
cooking was insipid; no harm in that. But why did the people I met,
whether well or ill disposed towards me, also seem insipid? There were
vivid personalities among them-Obsle, Slose, the handsome and detestable
Gaum -and yet each of them lacked some quality, some dimension of being;
and they failed to convince. They were not quite solid.</p>
<p>It was, I thought, as if they did not cast shadows.</p>
<p>’This kind of rather highflown speculation is an essential part of my
job. Without some capacity for it I could not have qualified as a
Mobile, and I received formal training in it on Hain, where they dignify
it with the title of Farfetching. What one is after when farfetching
might be described as the intuitive perception of a moral entirety; and
thus it tends to find expression not in rational symbols, but in
metaphor. I was never an outstanding farfetcher, and this night I
distrusted my own intuitions, being very tired. When I was back in my
apartment I took refuge in a hot shower. But even there I felt a vague
unease, as if the hot water was not altogether real and reliable, and
could not be counted on.</p>
