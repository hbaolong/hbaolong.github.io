<p>From the Archives of Hain. Transcript of Ansible Document
01-01101-934-2-Gethen: To the Stabile on Ollul: Report from Genly Ai,
First Mobile on Gethen/Winter, Hainish Cycle 93, Ekumenical Year
1490-97.</p>
<p>I’ll make my report as if I told a story, for I was taught as a child
on my homeworld that Truth is a matter of the imagination. The soundest
fact may fail or prevail in the style of its telling: like that singular
organic jewel of our seas, which grows brighter as one woman wears it
and, worn by another, dulls and goes to dust. Facts are no more solid,
coherent, round, and real than pearls are. But both are sensitive.</p>
<p>The story is not all mine, nor told by me alone. Indeed I am not sure
whose story it is; you can judge better. But it is all one, and if at
moments the facts seem to alter with an altered voice, why then you can
choose the fact you like best; yet none of them are false, and it is all
one story.</p>
<p>It starts on the 44th diurnal of the Year 1491, which on the planet
Winter in the nation Karhide was Odhar-hahad Tuwa or the twenty-second
day of the third month of spring in the Year One. It is always the Year
One here. Only the dating of every past and future year changes each New
Year’s Day, as one counts backwards or forwards from the unitary Now. So
it was spring of the Year One in Erhenrang, capital city of Karhide, and
I was in peril of my life, and did not know it.</p>
<p>I was in a parade. I walked just behind the gossiwors and just before
the king. It was raining.</p>
<p>Rainclouds over dark towers, rain falling in deep streets, a dark
storm-beaten city of stone, through which one vein of gold winds slowly.
First come merchants, potentates, and artisans of the City Erhenrang,
rank after rank, magnificently clothed, advancing through the rain as
comfortably as fish through the sea. Their faces are keen and calm. They
do not march in step. This is a parade with no soldiers, not even
imitation soldiers.</p>
<p>Next come the lords and mayors and representatives, one person, or
five, or forty-five, or four hundred, from each Domain and Co-Domain of
Karhide, a vast ornate procession that moves to the music of metal horns
and hollow blocks of bone and wood and the dry, pure lilting of electric
flutes. The various banners of the great Domains tangle in a rain-beaten
confusion of color with the yellow pennants that bedeck the way, and the
various musics of each group clash and interweave in many rhythms
echoing in the deep stone street.</p>
<p>Next, a troop of jugglers with polished spheres of gold which they
hurl up high in flashing flights, and catch, and hurl again, making
fountain-jets of bright jugglery. All at once, as if they had literally
caught the light, the gold spheres blaze bright as glass: the sun is
breaking through.</p>
<p>Next, forty men in yellow, playing gossiwors. The gossiwor, played
only in the king’s presence, produces a preposterous disconsolate
bellow. Forty of them played together shake one’s reason, shake the
towers of Erhenrang, shake down a last spatter of rain from the windy
clouds. If this is the Royal Music no wonder the kings of Karhide are
all mad.</p>
<p>Next, the royal party, guards and functionaries and dignitaries of
the city and the court, deputies, senators, chancellors, ambassadors,
lords of the Kingdom, none of them keeping step or rank yet walking with
great dignity; and among them is King Argaven XV, in white tunic and
shirt and breeches, with leggings of saffron leather and a peaked yellow
cap. A gold finger-ring is his only adornment and sign of office. Behind
this group eight sturdy fellows bear the royal litter, rough with yellow
sapphires, in which no king has ridden for centuries, a ceremonial relic
of the Very-Long-Ago. By the litter walk eight guards armed with “foray
guns,” also relics of a more barbaric past but not empty ones, being
loaded with pellets of soft iron. Death walks behind the king. Behind
death come the students of the Artisan Schools, the Colleges, the
Trades, and the King’s Hearths, long lines of children and young people
in white and red and gold and green; and finally a number of
soft-running, slow, dark cars end the parade.</p>
<p>The royal party, myself among them, gather on a platform of new
timbers beside the unfinished Arch of the River Gate. The occasion of
the parade is the completion of that arch, which completes the new Road
and River Port of Erhenrang, a great operation of dredging and building
and roadmaking which has taken five years, and will distinguish Argaven
XV’s reign in the annals of Karhide. We are all squeezed rather tight on
the platform in our damp and massive finery. The rain is gone, the sun
shines on us, the splendid, radiant, traitorous sun of Winter. I remark
to the person on my left, “It’s hot. It’s really hot.”</p>
<p>The person on my left-a stocky dark Karhider with sleek and heavy
hair, wearing a heavy overtunic of green leather worked with gold, and a
heavy white shirt, and heavy breeches, and a neck-chain of heavy silver
links a hand broad-this person, sweating heavily, replies, “So it
is.”</p>
<p>All about us as we stand jammed on our platform lie the faces of the
people of the city, upturned like a shoal of brown, round pebbles,
mica-glittering with thousands of watching eyes.</p>
<p>Now the king ascends a gangplank of raw timbers that leads from the
platform up to the top of the arch whose unjoined piers tower over crowd
and wharves and river. As he mounts the crowd stirs and speaks in a vast
murmur: “Argaven!” He makes no response. They expect none. Gossiwors
blow a thunderous discordant blast, cease. Silence. The sun shines on
city, river, crowd, and king. Masons below have set an electric winch
going, and as the king mounts higher the keystone of the arch goes up
past him in its sling, is raised, settled, and fitted almost
soundlessly, great ton-weight block though it is, into the gap between
the two piers, making them one, one thing, an arch. A mason with trowel
and bucket awaits the king, up on the scaffolding; all the other workmen
descend by rope ladders, like a swarm of fleas. The king and the mason
kneel, high between the river and the sun, on their bit of planking.
Taking the trowel the king begins to mortar the long joints of the
keystone. He does not dab at it and give the trowel back to the mason,
but sets to work methodically. The cement he uses is a pinkish color
different from the rest of the mortarwork, and after five or ten minutes
of watching the king-bee work I ask the person on my left, “Are your
keystones always set in a red cement?” For the same color is plain
around the keystone of each arch of the Old Bridge, that soars
beautifully over the river upstream from the arch.</p>
<p>Wiping sweat from his dark forehead the man - man I must say, having
said he and his- the man answers, “Very-long-ago a keystone was always
set in with a mortar of ground bones mixed with blood. Human bones,
human blood. Without the bloodbond the arch would fall, you see. We use
the blood of animals, these days.”</p>
<p>So he often speaks, frank yet cautious, ironic, as if always aware
that I see and judge as an alien: a singular awareness in one of so
isolate a race and so high a rank. He is one of the most powerful men in
the country; I am not sure of the proper historical equivalent of his
position, vizier or prime minister or councillor; the Karhidish word for
it means the King’s Ear. He is lord of a Domain and lord of the Kingdom,
a mover of great events. His name is Therem Harth rem ir Estraven.</p>
<p>The king seems to be finished with his masonry work, and I rejoice;
but crossing under the rise of the arch on his spiderweb of planks he
starts in on the other side of the keystone, which after all has two
sides. It doesn’t do to be impatient in Karhide. They are anything but a
phlegmatic people, yet they are obdurate, they are pertinacious, they
finish plastering joints. The crowds on the Sess Embankment are content
to watch the king work, but I am bored, and hot. I have never before
been hot, on Winter; I never will be again; yet I fail to appreciate the
event. I am dressed for the Ice Age and not for the sunshine, in layers
and layers of clothing, woven plant-fiber, artificial fiber, fur,
leather, a massive armor against the cold, within which I now wilt like
a radish leaf. For distraction I look at the crowds and the other
paraders drawn up around the platform, their Domain and Clan banners
hanging still and bright in sunlight, and idly I ask Estraven what this
banner is and that one and the other. He knows each one I ask about,
though there are hundreds, some from remote domains, hearths and
tribelets of the Pering Storm-border and Kerm Land.</p>
<p>“I’m from Kerm Land myself,” he says when I admire his knowledge.
“Anyhow it’s my business to know the Domains. They are Karhide. To
govern this land is to govern its lords. Not that it’s ever been done.
Do you know the saying, Karhide is not a nation but a family quarrel?” I
haven’t, and suspect that Estraven made it up; it has his stamp.</p>
<p>At this point another member of the kyorremy, the upper chamber or
parliament which Estraven heads, pushes and squeezes a way up close to
him and begins talking to him. This is the king’s cousin Pemmer Harge
rem ir Tibe. His voice is very low as he speaks to Estraven, his posture
faintly insolent, his smile frequent. Estraven, sweating like ice in the
sun, stays slick and cold as ice, answering Tibe’s murmurs aloud in a
tone whose commonplace politeness makes the other look rather a fool. I
listen, as I watch the king grouting away, but understand nothing except
the animosity between Tibe and Estraven. It’s nothing to do with me, in
any case, and I am simply interested in the behavior of these people who
rule a nation, in the old-fashioned sense, who govern the fortunes of
twenty million other people. Power has become so subtle and complex a
thing in the ways taken by the Ekumen that only a subtle mind can watch
it work; here it is still limited, still visible. In Estraven, for
instance, one feels the man’s power as an augmentation of his character;
he cannot make an empty gesture or say a word that is not listened to.
He knows it, and the knowledge gives him more reality than most people
own: a solidness of being, a substantiality, a human grandeur. Nothing
succeeds like success. I don’t trust Estraven, whose motives are forever
obscure; I don’t like him; yet I feel and respond to his authority as
surely as I do to the warmth of the sun.</p>
<p>Even as I think this the world’s sun dims between clouds regathering,
and soon a flaw of rain runs sparse and hard upriver, spattering the
crowds on the Embankment, darkening the sky. As the king comes down the
gangplank the light breaks through a last time, and his white figure and
the great arch stand out a moment vivid and splendid against the
storm-darkened south. The clouds close. A cold wind comes tearing up
Port-and-Palace Street, the river goes gray, the trees on the Embankment
shudder. The parade is over. Half an hour later it is snowing.</p>
<p>As the king’s car drove off up Port-and-Palace Street and the crowds
began to move like a rocky shingle rolled by a slow tide, Estraven
turned to me again and said, “Will you have supper with me tonight,
Mr. Ai?” I accepted, with more surprise than pleasure. Estraven had done
a great deal for me in the last six or eight months, but I did not
expect or desire such a show of personal favor as an invitation to his
house. Harge rem ir Tibe was still close to us, overhearing, and I felt
that he was meant to overhear. Annoyed by this sense of effeminate
intrigue I got off the platform and lost myself in the mob, crouching
and slouching somewhat to do so. I’m not much taller than the Gethenian
norm, but the difference is most noticeable in a crowd. That’s him,
look, there’s the Envoy. Of course that was part of my job, but it was a
part that got harder not easier as time went on; more and more often I
longed for anonymity, for sameness. I craved to be like everybody
else.</p>
<p>A couple of blocks up Breweries Street I turned off towards my
lodgings and suddenly, there where the crowd thinned out, found Tibe
walking beside me.</p>
<p>“A flawless event,” said the king’s cousin, smiling at me. His long,
clean, yellow teeth appeared and disappeared in a yellow face all
webbed, though he was not an old man, with fine, soft wrinkles.</p>
<p>“A good augury for the success of the new Port,” I said.</p>
<p>“Yes indeed.” More teeth.</p>
<p>“The ceremony of the keystone is most impressive-”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed. That ceremony descends to us from very-long-ago. But no
doubt Lord Estraven explained all that to you.”</p>
<p>“Lord Estraven is most obliging.” I was trying to speak insipidly,
yet everything I said to Tibe seemed to take on a double meaning.</p>
<p>“Oh very much indeed,” said Tibe. “Indeed Lord Estraven is famous for
his kindness to foreigners.” He smiled again, and every tooth seemed to
have a meaning, double, multiple, thirty-two different meanings.</p>
<p>“Few foreigners are so foreign as I, Lord Tibe. I am very grateful
for kindnesses.”</p>
<p>“Yes indeed, yes indeed! And gratitude’s a noble, rare emotion, much
praised by the poets. Rare above all here in Erhenrang, no doubt because
it’s impracticable. This is a hard age we live in, an ungrateful age.
Things aren’t as they were in our grandparents’ days, are they?”</p>
<p>“I scarcely know, sir, but I’ve heard the same lament on other
worlds.”</p>
<p>Tibe stared at me for some while as if establishing lunacy. Then he
brought out the long yellow teeth.</p>
<p>“Ah yes! Yes indeed! I keep forgetting that you come from another
planet. But of course that’s not a matter you ever forget. Though no
doubt life would be much sounder and simpler and safer for you here in
Erhen-rang if you could forget it, eh? Yes indeed! Here’s my car, I had
it wait here out of the way. I’d like to offer to drive you to your
island, but must forego the privilege, as I’m due at the King’s House
very shortly and poor relations must be in good time, as the saying is,
eh? Yes indeed!” said the king’s cousin, climbing into his little black
electric car, teeth bared across his shoulder at me, eyes veiled by a
net of wrinkles.</p>
<p>I walked on home to my island. Its front garden was revealed now that
the last of the winter’s snow had melted and the winter-doors, ten feet
aboveground, were sealed off for a few months, till the autumn and the
deep snow should return. Around at the side of the building in the mud
and the ice and the quick, soft, rank spring growth of the garden, a
young couple stood talking. Their right hands were clasped. They were in
the first phase of kemmer. The large, soft snow danced about them as
they stood barefoot in the icy mud, hands clasped, eyes all for each
other. Spring on Winter.</p>
<p>*Karhosh, island, the usual word for the apartment-boarding house
buildings that house the greatest part of the urban populations of
Karhide. Islands contain 20 to 200 private rooms; meals are communal;
some are run as hotels, others as cooperative communes, others combine
these types. They are certainly an urban adaptation of the fundamental
Karhidish institution of the Hearth, though lacking, of course, the
topical and genealogical stability of the Hearth.</p>
<p>I had dinner at my island and at Fourth Hour striking on the gongs of
Remny Tower I was at the Palace ready for supper. Karhiders eat four
solid meals a day, breakfast, lunch, dinner, supper, along with a lot of
adventitious nibbling and gobbling in between. There are no large
meat-animals on Winter, and no mammalian products, milk, butter or
cheese; the only high-protein, high-carbohydrate foods are the various
kinds of eggs, fish, nuts, and the Hainish grains. A lowgrade diet for a
bitter climate, and one must refuel often. I had got used to eating, as
it seemed, every few minutes. It wasn’t until later in that year that I
discovered the Gethenians have perfected the technique not only of
perpetually stuffing, but also of indefinitely starving.</p>
<p>The snow still fell, a mild spring blizzard, much pleasanter than the
relentless rain of the Thaw just past. I made my way to and through the
Palace in the quiet and pale darkness of snowfall, losing my way only
once. The Palace of Erhenrang is an inner city, a walled wilderness of
palaces, towers, gardens, courtyards, cloisters, roofed bridgeways,
roofless tunnel-walks, small forests and dungeon-keeps, the product of
centuries of paranoia on a grand scale. Over it all rise the grim, red,
elaborate walls of the Royal House, which though in perpetual use is
inhabited by no one beside the king himself. Everyone else, servants,
staff, lords, ministers, parliamentarians, guards or whatever, sleeps in
another palace or fort or keep or barracks or house inside the walls.
Estraven’s house, sign of the king’s high favor, was the Corner Red
Dwelling, built 440 years ago for Harmes, beloved kemmering of Emran
III, whose beauty is still celebrated, and who was abducted, mutilated,
and rendered imbecile by hirelings of the Inner-land Faction. Emran III
died forty years after, still wreaking vengeance on his unhappy country:
Emran the Ill-fated. The tragedy is so old that its horror has leached
away and only a certain air of faithlessness and melancholy clings to
the stones and shadows of the house. The garden was small and walled;
serem-trees leaned over a rocky pool. In dim shafts of light from the
windows of the house I saw snowflakes and the threadlike white
spore-cases of the trees falling softly together onto the dark water.
Estraven stood waiting for me, bareheaded and coatless in the cold,
watching that small secret ceaseless descent of snow and seeds in the
night. He greeted me quietly and brought me into the house. There were
no other guests.</p>
<p>I wondered at this, but we went to table at once, and one does not
talk business while eating; besides, my wonder was diverted to the meal,
which was superb, even the eternal bread-apples transmuted by a cook
whose art I heartily praised. After supper, by the fire, we drank hot
beer. On a world where a common table implement is a little device with
which you crack the ice that has formed on your drink between drafts,
hot beer is a thing you come to appreciate.</p>
<p>Estraven had conversed amiably at table; now, sitting across the
hearth from me, he was quiet. Though I had been nearly two years on
Winter I was still far from being able to see the people of the planet
through their own eyes. I tried to, but my efforts took the form of
self-consciously seeing a Gethenian first as a man, then as a woman,
forcing him into those categories so irrelevant to his nature and so
essential to my own. Thus as I sipped my smoking sour beer I thought
that at table Estraven’s performance had been womanly, all charm and
tact and lack of substance, specious and adroit. Was it in fact perhaps
this soft supple femininity that I disliked and distrusted in him? For
it was impossible to think of him as a woman, that dark, ironic,
powerful presence near me in the firelit darkness, and yet whenever I
thought of him as a man I felt a sense of falseness, of imposture: in
him, or in my own attitude towards him? His voice was soft and rather
resonant but not deep, scarcely a man’s voice, but scarcely a woman’s
voice either… but what was it saying?</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” he was saying, “that I’ve had to forestall for so long
this pleasure of having you in my house; and to that extent at least I’m
glad there is no longer any question of patronage between us.”</p>
<p>I puzzled at this a while. He had certainly been my patron in court
until now. Did he mean that the audience he had arranged for me with the
king tomorrow had raised me to an equality with himself? “I don’t think
I follow you,” I said.</p>
<p>At that, he was silent, evidently also puzzled. “Well, you
understand,” he said at last, “being here . . . you understand that I am
no longer acting on your behalf with the king, of course.”</p>
<p>He spoke as if ashamed of me, not of himself. Clearly there was a
significance in his invitation and my acceptance of it which I had
missed. But my blunder was in manners, his in morals. All I thought at
first was that I had been right all along not to trust Estraven. He was
not merely adroit and not merely powerful, he was faithless. All these
months in Erhenrang it had been he who listened to me, who answered my
questions, sent physicians and engineers to verify the alienness of my
physique and my ship, introduced me to people I needed to know, and
gradually elevated me from my first year’s status as a highly
imaginative monster to my present recognition as the mysterious Envoy,
about to be received by the king. Now, having got me up on that
dangerous eminence, he suddenly and coolly announced he was withdrawing
his support.</p>
<p>“You’ve led me to rely on you-”</p>
<p>“It was ill done.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean that, having arranged this audience, you haven’t spoken
in favor of my mission to the king, as you-” I had the sense to stop
short of “promised.”</p>
<p>“I can’t.”</p>
<p>I was very angry, but I met neither anger nor apology in him.</p>
<p>“Will you tell me why?”</p>
<p>After a while he said, “Yes,” and then paused again. During the pause
I began to think that an inept and undefended alien should not demand
reasons from the prime minister of a kingdom, above all when he does not
and perhaps never will understand the foundations of power and the
workings of government in that kingdom. No doubt this was all a matter
of shifgrethor- prestige, face, place, the pride-relationship, the
untranslatable and all-important principle of social authority in
Karhide and all civilizations of Gethen. And if it was I would not
understand it.</p>
<p>“Did you hear what the king said to me at the ceremony today?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Estraven leaned forward across the hearth, lifted the beer-jug out of
the hot ashes, and refilled my tankard. He said nothing more, so I
amplified, “The king didn’t speak to you in my hearing.”</p>
<p>“Nor in mine,” said he.</p>
<p>I saw at last that I was missing another signal. Damning his
effeminate deviousness, I said, “Are you trying to tell me, Lord
Estraven, that you’re out of favor with the king?”</p>
<p>I think he was angry then, but he said nothing that showed it, only,
“I’m not trying to tell you anything, Mr. Ai.”</p>
<p>“By God, I wish you would!”</p>
<p>He looked at me curiously. “Well, then, put it this way. There are
some persons in court who are, in your phrase, in favor with the king,
but who do not favor your presence or your mission here.”</p>
<p>And so you’re hurrying to join them, selling me out to save your
skin, I thought, but there was no point in saying it. Estraven was a
courtier, a politician, and I a fool to have trusted him. Even in a
bisexual society the politician is very often something less than an
integral man. His inviting me to dinner showed that he thought I would
accept his betrayal as easily as he committed it. Clearly face-saving
was more important than honesty. So I brought myself to say, “I’m sorry
that your kindness to me has made trouble for you.” Coals of fire. I
enjoyed a flitting sense of moral superiority, but not for long; he was
too incalculable.</p>
<p>He sat back so that the firelight lay ruddy on his knees and his
fine, strong, small hands and on the silver tankard he held, but left
his face in shadow: a dark face always shadowed by the thick low growing
hair, and heavy brows and lashes, and by a somber blandness of
expression. Can one read a cat’s face, a seal’s, an otter’s? Some
Gethenians, I thought, are like such animals, with deep bright eyes that
do not change expression when you speak.</p>
<p>“I’ve made trouble for myself,” he answered, “by an act that had
nothing to do with you, Mr. Ai. You know that Karhide and Orgoreyn have
a dispute concerning a stretch of our border in the high North Fall near
Sassinoth. Argaven’s grandfather claimed the Sinoth Valley for Karhide,
and the Commensals have never recognized the claim. A lot of snow out of
one cloud, and it grows thicker. I’ve been helping some Karhidish
farmers who live in the Valley to move back east across the old border,
thinking the argument might settle itself if the Valley were simply left
to the Orgota, who have lived there for several thousand years. I was in
the Administration of the North Fall some years ago, and got to know
some of those farmers. I dislike the thought of their being killed in
forays, or sent to Voluntary Farms in Orgoreyn. Why not obviate the
subject of dispute? . .. But that’s not a patriotic idea. In fact it’s a
cowardly one, and impugns the shifgrethor of the king himself.”</p>
<p>His ironies, and these ins and outs of a border-dispute with
Orgoreyn, were of no interest to me. I returned to the matter that lay
between us. Trust him or not, I might still get some use out of him.
“I’m sorry,” I said, “but it seems a pity that this question of a few
farmers may be allowed to spoil the chances of my mission with the king.
There’s more at stake than a few miles of national boundary.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Much more. But perhaps the Ekumen, which is a hundred
light-years from border to border, will be patient with us a while.”</p>
<p>“The Stabiles of the Ekumen are very patient men, sir. They’ll wait a
hundred years or five hundred for Karhide and the rest of Gethen to
deliberate and consider whether or not to join the rest of mankind. I
speak merely out of personal hope. And personal disappointment. I own
that I thought that with your support-”</p>
<p>“I too. Well, the Glaciers didn’t freeze overnight. . . .” Cliche
came ready to his lips, but his mind was elsewhere. He brooded. I
imagined him moving me around with the other pawns in his power-game.
“You came to my country,” he said at last, “at a strange time. Things
are changing; we are taking a new turning. No, not so much that, as
following too far on the way we’ve been going. I thought that your
presence, your mission, might prevent our going wrong, give us a new
option entirely.</p>
<p>But at the right moment-in the right place. It is all exceedingly
chancy, Mr. Ai.”</p>
<p>Impatient with his generalities, I said, “You imply that this isn’t
the right moment. Would you advise me to cancel my audience?”</p>
<p>My gaffe was even worse in Karhidish, but Estraven did not smile, or
wince. “I’m afraid only the king has that privilege,” he said
mildly.</p>
<p>“Oh God, yes. I didn’t mean that.” I put my head in my hands a
moment. Brought up in the wide-open, free-wheeling society of Earth, I
would never master the protocol, or the impassivity, so valued by
Karhiders. I knew what a king was, Earth’s own history is full of them,
but I had no experiential feel for privilege-no tact. I picked up my
tankard and drank a hot and violent draft. “Well, I’ll say less to the
king than I intended to say, when I could count on you.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“Why good?” I demanded.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Ai, you’re not insane. I’m not insane. But then neither of
us is a king, you see … I suppose that you intended to tell Argaven,
rationally, that your mission here is to attempt to bring about an
alliance between Gethen and the Ekumen. And, rationally, he knows that
already; because, as you know, I told him. I urged your case with him,
tried to interest him in you. It was ill done, ill timed. I forgot,
being too interested myself, that he’s a king, and does not see things
rationally, but as a king. All I’ve told him means to him simply that
his power is threatened, his kingdom is a dust mote in space, his
kingship is a joke to men who rule a hundred worlds.”</p>
<p>“But the Ekumen doesn’t rule, it co-ordinates. Its power is precisely
the power of its member states and worlds. In alliance with the Ekumen,
Karhide will become infinitely less threatened and more important than
it’s ever been.”</p>
<p>Estraven did not answer for a while. He sat gazing at the fire, whose
flames winked, reflected, from his tankard and from the broad bright
silver chain of office over his shoulders. The old house was silent
around us. There had been a servant to attend our meal, but Karhiders,
having no institutions of slavery or personal bondage, hire services not
people, and the servants had all gone off to their own homes by now.
Such a man as Estraven must have guards about him somewhere, for
assassination is a lively institution in Karhide, but I had seen no
guard, heard none. We were alone.</p>
<p>I was alone, with a stranger, inside the walls of a dark palace, in a
strange snow-changed city, in the heart of the Ice Age of an alien
world.</p>
<p>Everything I had said, tonight and ever since I came to Winter,
suddenly appeared to me as both stupid and incredible. How could I
expect this man or any other to believe my tales about other worlds,
other races, a vague benevolent government somewhere off in outer space?
It was all nonsense. I had appeared in Karhide in a queer kind of ship,
and I differed physically from Gethenians in some respects; that wanted
explaining. But my own explanations were preposterous. I did not, in
that moment, believe them myself. .”I believe you,” said the stranger,
the alien alone with me, and so strong had my access of self-alienation
been that I looked up at him bewildered. “I’m afraid that Argaven also
believes you. But he does not trust you. In part because he no longer
trusts me. I have made mistakes, been careless. I cannot ask for your
trust any longer, either, having put you in jeopardy. I forgot what a
king is, forgot that the king in his own eyes is Karhide, forgot what
patriotism is and that he is, of necessity, the perfect patriot. Let me
ask you this, Mr. Ai: do you know, by your own experience, what
patriotism is?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, shaken by the force of that intense personality
suddenly turning itself wholly upon me. “I don’t think I do. If by
patriotism you don’t mean the love of one’s homeland, for that I do
know.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t mean love, when I say patriotism. I mean fear. The fear
of the other. And its expressions are political, not poetical: hate,
rivalry, aggression. It grows in us, that fear. It grows in us year by
year. We’ve followed our road too far. And you, who come from a world
that outgrew nations centuries ago, who hardly know what I’m talking
about, who show us the new road-” He broke off. After a while he went
on, in control again, cool and polite: “It’s because of fear that I
refuse to urge your cause with the king, now. But not fear for myself,
Mr. Ai. I’m not acting patriotically. There are, after all, other
nations on Gethen.”</p>
<p>I had no idea what he was driving at, but was sure that he did not
mean what he seemed to mean. Of all the dark, obstructive, enigmatic
souls I had met in this bleak city, his was the darkest. I would not
play his labyrinthine game. I made no reply. After a while he went on,
rather cautiously, “If I’ve understood you, your Ekumen is devoted
essentially to the general interest of mankind. Now, for instance, the
Orgota have experience in subordinating local interests to a general
interest, while Karhide has almost none. And the Commensals of Orgoreyn
are mostly sane men, if unintelligent, while the king of Karhide is not
only insane but rather stupid.”</p>
<p>It was clear that Estraven had no loyalties at all. I said in faint
disgust, “It must be difficult to serve him, if that’s the case.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure I’ve ever served the king,” said the king’s prime
minister. “Or ever intended to. I’m not anyone’s servant. A man must
cast his own shadow….”</p>
<p>The gongs in Remny Tower were striking Sixth Hour, midnight, and I
took them as my excuse to go. As I was putting on my coat in the hallway
he said, “I’ve lost my chance for the present, for I suppose you’ll be
leaving Ehrenrang -” why did he suppose so?-”but I trust a day will come
when I can ask you questions again. There’s so much I want to know.
About your mind-speech, in particular; you’d scarcely begun to try to
explain it to me.”</p>
<p>His curiosity seemed perfectly genuine. He had the effrontery of the
powerful. His promises to help me had seemed genuine, too. I said yes,
of course, whenever he liked, and that was the evening’s end. He showed
me out through the garden, where snow lay thin in the light of Gethen’s
big, dull, rufous moon. I shivered as we went out, for it was well below
freezing, and he said with polite surprise, “You’re cold?” To him of
course it was a mild spring night.</p>
<p>I was tired and downcast. I said, “I’ve been cold ever since I came
to this world.”</p>
<p>“What do you call it, this world, in your language?”</p>
<p>“Gethen.”</p>
<p>“You gave it no name of your own?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the First Investigators did. They called it Winter.”</p>
<p>We had stopped in the gateway of the walled garden. Outside, the
Palace grounds and roofs loomed in a dark snowy jumble lit here and
there at various heights by the faint gold slits of windows. Standing
under the narrow arch I glanced up, wondering if that keystone too was
mortared with bone and blood. Estraven took leave of me and turned away;
he was never fulsome in his greetings and farewells. I went off through
the silent courts and alleys of the Palace, my boots crunching on the
thin moonlit snow, and homeward through the deep streets of the city. I
was cold, unconfident, obsessed by perfidy, and solitude, and fear.</p>
