<h4 id="the-escape">14. The Escape</h4>
<p>When Obsle and Yegey both left town, and Slose’s doorkeeper refused
me entrance, I knew it was time to turn to my enemies, for there was no
more good in my friends. I went to Commissioner Shusgis, and blackmailed
him. Lacking sufficient cash to buy him with, I had to spend my
reputation. Among the perfidious, the name of traitor is capital in
itself. I told him that I was in Orgoreyn as agent of the Nobles Faction
in Karhide, which was planning the assassination of Tibe, and that he
had been designated as my Sarf contact; if he refused to give me the
information I needed I would tell my friends in Erhenrang that he was a
double agent, serving the Open Trade Faction, and this word would of
course get back to Mishnory and to the Sarf: and the damned fool
believed me. He told me quick enough what I wanted to know; he even
asked me if I approved.</p>
<p>I was not in immediate danger from my friends Obsle, Yegey, and the
others. They had bought their safety by sacrificing the Envoy, and
trusted me to make no trouble for them or myself. Until I went to
Shusgis, no one in the Sarf but Gaum had considered me worthy their
notice, but now they would be hard at my heels. I must finish my
business and drop out of sight. Having no way to get word directly to
anyone in Karhide, as mail would be read and telephone or radio listened
to, I went for the first time to the Royal Embassy. Sardon rem ir
Chenewich, whom I had known well at court, was on the staff there. He
agreed at once to convey to Argaven a message stating what had become of
the Envoy and where he was to be imprisoned. I could trust Chenewich, a
clever and honest person, to get the message through unintercepted,
though what Argaven would make of it or do with it I could not guess. I
wanted Argaven to have that information in case Ai’s Star Ship did come
suddenly falling down out of the clouds; for at that time I still kept
some hope that he had signaled the Ship before the Sarf arrested
him.</p>
<p>I was now in peril, and if I had been seen to enter the Embassy, in
instant peril. I went straight from its door to the caravan port on the
Southside and before noon of that day, Odstreth Susmy, I left Mishnory
as I had entered it, as carry-loader on a truck. I had my old permits
with me, a little altered to fit the new job. Forgery of papers is risky
in Orgoreyn where they are inspected fifty-two times daily, but it is
not rare for being risky, and my old companions in Fish Island had shown
me the tricks of it. To wear a false name galls me, but nothing else
would save me, or get me clear across the width of Orgoreyn to the coast
of the Western Sea.</p>
<p>My thoughts were all there in the west as the caravan went rumbling
across the Kunderer Bridge and out of Mishnory. Autumn was facing
towards winter now, and I must get to my destination before the roads
closed to fast traffic, and while there was still some good in getting
there. I had seen a Voluntary Farm over in Komsvashom when I was in the
Sinoth Administration, and had talked with ex-prisoners of Farms. What I
had seen and heard lay heavy on me now. The Envoy, so vulnerable to cold
that he wore a coat when the weather was in the 30’s, would not survive
winter in Pulefen. Thus need drove me fast, but the caravan took me
slow, weaving from town to town northward and southward of the way,
loading and unloading, so that it took me a halfmonth to get to Ethwen,
at the mouth of the River Esagel.</p>
<p>In Ethwen I had luck. Talking with men in the Transient-House I heard
of the fur trade up the river, how licensed trappers went up and down
river by sledge or iceboat through Tarrenpeth Forest almost to the Ice.
Out of their talk of traps came my plan of trap-springing. There are
white-fur pesthry in Kerm Land as in the Gobrin Hinterlands; they like
places that lie under the breath of the glacier. I had hunted them when
I was young in the thore-forests of Kerm, why not go trapping them now
in the thore-forests of Pulefen?</p>
<p>In that far west and north of Orgoreyn, in the great wild lands west
of the Sembensyen, men come and go somewhat as they like, for there are
not enough Inspectors to keep them all penned in. Something of the old
freedom survives the New Epoch, there. Ethwen is a gray port built on
the gray rocks of Esagel Bay; a rainy sea-wind blows in the streets, and
the people are grim seamen, straight-spoken. I look back with praise to
Ethwen, where my luck changed.</p>
<p>I bought skis, snowshoes, traps, and provisions, acquired my hunter’s
license and authorization and identification and so forth from the
Commensal Bureau, and set out afoot up the Esagel with a party of
hunters led by an old man called Mavriva. The river was not yet frozen,
and wheels were on the roads still, for it rained more than it snowed on
this coastal slope even now in the year’s last month. Most hunters
waited till full winter, and in the month of Them went up the Esagel by
iceboat, but Mavriva meant to get far north early and trap the pesthry
as they first came down into the forests in their migration. Mavriva
knew the Hinterlands, the North Sembensyen, and the Fire-Hills as well
as any man knows them, and in those days going upriver I learned much
from him that served me later.</p>
<p>At the town called Turuf I dropped out of the party feigning illness.
They went on north, after which I struck out northeastward by myself
into the high foothills of the Sembensyen. I spent some days learning
the land and then, caching almost all I carried in a hidden valley
twelve or thirteen miles from Turuf, I came back to the town,
approaching it from the south again, and this time entered it and put up
at the Transient-House. As if stocking up for a trapping run I bought
skis, snowshoes, and provisions, a fur bag and winter clothing, all over
again; also a Chabe stove, a polyskin tent, and a light sledge to load
it all on. Then nothing to do but wait for the rain to turn to snow and
the mud to ice: not long, for I had spent over a month on my way from
Mishnory to Turuf. On Arhad Them the winter was frozen in and the snow I
had waited for was falling.</p>
<p>I passed the electric fences of Pulefen Farm in early afternoon, all
track and trace behind me soon covered by the snowfall. I left the
sledge in a stream-gully well into the forest east of the Farm and
carrying only a backpack snowshoed back around to the road; along it I
came openly to the Farm’s front gate. There I showed the papers which I
had reforged again while waiting in Turuf. They were “blue stamp” now,
identifying me as Thener Benth, paroled convict, and attached to them
was an order to report on or before Eps Them to Pulefen Commensality
Third Voluntary Farm for two years’ guard duty. A sharp-eyed Inspector
would have been suspicious of those battered papers, but there were few
sharp eyes here.</p>
<p>Nothing easier than getting into prison. I was somewhat reassured as
to the getting out.</p>
<p>The chief guard on duty berated me for arriving a day later than my
orders specified, and sent me to the barracks. Dinner was over, and
luckily it was too late to issue me regulation boots and uniform and
confiscate my own good clothing. They gave me no gun, but I found one
handy while I scrounged around the kitchen coaxing the cook for a bite
to eat. The cook kept his gun hung on a nail behind the bake-ovens. I
stole it. It had no lethal setting; perhaps none of the guards’ guns
did. They do not kill people on their Farms: they let hunger and winter
and despair do their murders for them.</p>
<p>There were thirty or forty jailkeepers and a hundred and fifty or
sixty prisoners, none of them very well off, most of them sound asleep
though it was not much past Fourth Hour. I got a young guard to take me
around and show me the prisoners asleep. I saw them in the staring light
of the great room they slept in, and all but gave up my hope of acting
that first night before1 had drawn suspicion on myself. They were all
hidden away on the longbeds in their bags like babies in wombs,
invisible, indistinguishable. -All but one, there, too long to hide, a
dark face like a skull, eyes shut and sunken, a mat of long, fibrous
hair.</p>
<p>The luck that had turned in Ethwen now turned the world with it under
my hand. I never had a gift but one, to know when the great wheel gives
to a touch, to know and act. I had thought that foresight lost, last
year in Erhenrang, and never to be regained. A great delight it was to
feel that certainty again, to know that I could steer my fortune and the
world’s chance like a bobsled down the steep, dangerous hour.</p>
<p>Since I still went roaming and prying about, in my part as a restless
curious dimwitted fellow, they wrote me onto the late watch-shift; by
midnight all but I and one other late watcher within doors slept. I kept
up my shiftless poking about the place, wandering up and down from time
to time by the longbeds. I settled my plans, and began to ready my will
and body to enter dothe, for my own strength would never suffice unaided
by the strength out of the Dark. A while before dawn I went into the
sleeping-room once more and with the cook’s gun gave Genly Ai a
hundredth-second of stun to the brain, then hoisted him up bag and all
and carried him out over my shoulder to the guardroom. “What’s doing?”
says the other guard half asleep, “let him bel”</p>
<p>“He’s dead.”</p>
<p>“Another one dead? By Meshe’s guts, and not hardly winter yet.” He
turned his head sideways to look into the Envoy’s face as it hung down
on my back. “That one, the Pervert, is it. By the Eye, I didn’t believe
all they say about Karhiders, till I took a look at him, the ugly freak
he is. He spent all week on the longbed moaning and sighing, but I
didn’t think he’d die right off like that. Well, go dump him outside
where he’ll keep till daylight, don’t stand there like a carry-loader
with a sack of turds.. ..”</p>
<p>I stopped by the Inspection Office on my way down the corridor, and I
being the guard none stopped me from entering and looking till I found
the wall-panel that contained the alarms and switches. None was labeled,
but guards had scratched letters beside the switches to jog their memory
when haste was needed; taking F.f. for “fences” I turned that switch to
cut the current to the outermost defenses of the Farm, and then went on,
pulling Ai along now by the shoulders. I came by the guard on duty in
the watchroom by the door. I made a show of laboring to haul the dead
load, for the dothe-strength was full within me and I did not want it
seen how easily, in fact, I could pull or carry the weight of a man
heavier than myself. I said, “A dead prisoner, they said get him out of
the sleeping-room. Where do I stow him?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. Get him outside. Under a roof, so he won’t get
snow-buried and float up stinking next spring in the thaws. It’s snowing
peditia.” He meant what we call sove-snow, a thick, wet fall, the best
of news to me. “All right, all right,” I said, and lugged my load
outside and around the corner of the barracks, out of his sight. I got
Ai up over my shoulders again, went northeast a few hundred yards,
clambered up over the dead fence and slung my burden down, jumped down
free, took up Ai once more and made off as fast as I could towards the
river. I was not far from the fence when a whistle began to shriek and
the floodlights went on. It snowed hard enough to hide me, but not hard
enough to hide my tracks within minutes. Yet when I got down to the
river they were not yet on my trail. I went north on clear ground under
the trees, or through the water when there was no clear ground; the
river, a hasty little tributary of the Esagel, was still unfrozen.
Things were growing plain now in the dawn and I went fast. In full dothe
I found the Envoy, though a long awkward load, no heavy one. Following
the stream into the forest I came to the ravine where my sledge was, and
onto the sledge I strapped the Envoy, loading my stuff around and over
him till he was well hidden, and a weather-sheet over all; then I
changed clothes, and ate some food from my pack, for the great hunger
one feels in long-sustained dothe was already gnawing at me. Then I set
off north on the main Forest Road. Before long a pair of skiers came up
with me.</p>
<p>I was now dressed and equipped as a trapper, and told them that I was
trying to catch up with Mavriva’s outfit, which had gone north in the
last days of Grende. They knew Mavriva, and accepted my story after a
glance at my trapper’s license. They were not expecting to find the
escaped men heading north, for nothing lies north of Pulefen but the
forest and the Ice; they were perhaps not very interested in finding the
escaped men at all. Why should they be? They went on, and only an hour
later passed me again on their way back to the Farm. One of them was the
fellow I had stood late watch with. He had never seen my face, though he
had had it before his eyes half the night.</p>
<p>When they were surely gone I turned off the road and all that day
followed a long halfcircle back through the forest and the foothills
east of the Farm, coming in at last from the east, from the wilderness,
to the hidden dell above Turuf where I had cached all my spare
equipment. It was hard sledging in that much-folded land, with more than
my weight to pull, but the snow was thick and already growing firm, and
I was in dothe. I had to maintain the condition, for once one lets the
dothe-strength lapse one is good for nothing at all. I had never
maintained dothe before for over an hour or so, but I knew that some of
the Old Men can keep in the full strength for a day and a night or even
longer, and my present need proved a good supplement to my training. In
dothe one does not worry much, and what anxiety I had was for the Envoy,
who should have waked long ago from the light dose of sonic I had given
him. He never stirred, and I had no time to tend to him. Was his body so
alien that what to us is mere paralysis was death to him? When the wheel
turns under your hand, you must watch your words: and I had twice called
him dead, and carried him as the dead are carried. The thought would
come that this was then a dead man that I hauled across the hills, and
that my luck and his life had gone to waste after all. At that I would
sweat and swear, and the dothe-strength would seem to run out of me like
water out of a broken jar. But I went on, and the strength did not fail
me till I had reached the cache in the foothills, and set up the tent,
and done what I could for Ai. I opened a box of hyperfood cubes, most of
which I devoured, but some of which I got into him as a broth, for he
looked near to starving. There were ulcers on his arms and breast, kept
raw by the filthy sleeping-bag he lay in. When these sores were cleaned
and he lay warm in the fur bag, as well hidden as winter and wilderness
could hide him, there was no more I could do. Night had fallen and the
greater darkness, the payment for the voluntary summoning of the body’s
full strength, was coming hard upon me; to darkness I must entrust
myself, and him.</p>
<p>We slept. Snow fell. All the night and day and night of my
thangen-sleep it must have snowed, no blizzard, but the first great
snowfall of winter. When at last I roused and pulled myself up to look
out, the tent was half buried. Sunlight and blue shadows lay vivid on
the snow. Far and high in the east one drift of gray dimmed the sky’s
brightness: the smoke of Udenushreke, nearest to us of the Fire-Hills.
Around the little peak of the tent lay the snow, mounds, hillocks,
swells, slopes, all white, untrodden.</p>
<p>Being still in the recovery-period I was very weak and sleepy, but
whenever I could rouse myself I gave Ai broth, a little at a time; and
in the evening of that day he came to life,ii not to his wits. He sat up
crying out as if in great terror. When I knelt by him he struggled to
get away from me, and the effort being too much for him,fainted. That
night he talked much, in no tongue I knew. It was strange, in that dark
stillness of the wilds, to hear him mutter words of a language he had
learned on another world than this. The next day was hard, for whenever
I tried to look after him he took me, I think, for one of the guards at
the Farm, and was in terror that I would give him some drug. He would
break out into Orgota and Karhidish all babbled pitifully together,
begging me “not to,” and he fought me with a panic strength. This
happened again and again, and as I was still in thangen and weak of limb
and will, it seemed I could not care for him at all. That day I thought
that they had not only drugged but mind-changed him, leaving him insane
or imbecile. Then I wished that he had died on the sledge in the
thore-forest, or that I had never had any luck at all, but had been
arrested as I left Mishnory and sent to some Farm to work out my own
damnation.</p>
<p>I woke from sleep and he was watching me.</p>
<p>“Estraven?” he said in a weak amazed whisper.</p>
<p>Then my heart lifted up. I could reassure him, and see to his needs;
and that night we both slept well.</p>
<p>The next day he was much improved, and sat up to eat. The sores on
his body were healing. I asked him what they were.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I think the drugs caused them; they kept giving me
injections. . . .”</p>
<p>“To prevent kemmer?” That was one report I had heard from men escaped
or released from Voluntary Farms.</p>
<p>“Yes. And others, I don’t know what they were, veridicals of some
kind. They made me ill, and they kept giving them to me. What were they
trying to find out, what could I tell them?”</p>
<p>“They may have not so much been questioning as domesticating
you.”</p>
<p>“Domesticating?”</p>
<p>“Rendering you docile by a forced addiction to one of the orgrevy
derivatives. That practice is not unknown in Karhide. Or they may have
been carrying out an experiment on you and the others. I have been told
they test mind changing drugs and techniques on prisoners in the Farms.
I doubted that, when I heard it; not now.”</p>
<p>“You have these Farms in Karhide?”</p>
<p>“In Karhide?” I said. “No.”</p>
<p>He rubbed his forehead fretfully. “They’d say in Mishnory that there
are no such places in Orgoreyn, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary. They’d boast of them, and show you tapes and
pictures of the Voluntary Farms, where deviates are rehabilitated and
vestigial tribal groups are given refuge. They might show you around the
First District Voluntary Farm just outside Mishnory, a fine showplace
from all accounts. If you believe that we have Farms in Karhide, Mr. Ai,
you overestimate us seriously. We are not a sophisticated people.”</p>
<p>He lay a long time staring at the glowing Chabe stove, which I had
turned up till it gave out suffocating heat. Then he looked at me.</p>
<p>“You told me this morning, I know, but my mind wasn’t clear, I think.
Where are we, how did we get here?” I told him again.</p>
<p>“You simply . .. walked out with me?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ai, any one of you prisoners, or all of you together, could have
walked out of that place, any night. If you weren’t starved, exhausted,
demoralized, and drugged; and if you had winter clothing; and if you had
somewhere to go. . . . There’s the catch. Where would you go? To a town?
No papers; you’re done for. Into the wilderness? No shelter; you’re done
for. In summer, I expect they bring more guards into Pulefen Farm. In
winter, they use winter itself to guard it.”</p>
<p>He was scarcely listening. “You couldn’t carry me a hundred feet,
Estraven. Let alone run, carrying, me, a couple of miles cross-country
in the dark-”</p>
<p>“I was in dothe.”</p>
<p>He hesitated. “Voluntarily induced?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You are … one of the Handdarata?”</p>
<p>“I was brought up in the Handdara, and indwelt two years at Rotherer
Fastness. In Kerm Land most people of the Inner Hearths are
Handdarata.”</p>
<p>“I thought that after the dothe period, the extreme drain on one’s
energy necessitated a sort of collapse-”</p>
<p>“Yes; thangen, it’s called, the dark sleep. It lasts much longer than
the dothe period, and once you enter the recovery period it’s very
dangerous to try to resist it. I slept straight through two nights. I’m
still in thangen now; I couldn’t walk over the hill. And hunger’s part
of it, I’ve eaten up most of the rations I’d planned to last me the
week.”</p>
<p>“All right,” he said with peevish haste. “I see, I believe you-what
can I do but believe you. Here I am, here you are. . . . But I don’t
understand. I don’t understand what you did all this for.”</p>
<p>At that my temper broke, and I must stare at the ice-knife which lay
close by my hand, not looking at him and not replying until I had
controlled my anger. Fortunately there was not yet much heat or
quickness in my heart, and I said to myself that he was an ignorant man,
a foreigner, ill-used and frightened. So I arrived at justice, and said
finally, “I feel that it is in part my fault that you came to Orgoreyn
and so to Pulefen Farm. I am trying to amend my fault.”</p>
<p>“You had nothing to do with my coming to Orgoreyn.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Ai, we’ve seen the same events with different eyes; I wrongly
thought they’d seem the same to us. Let me go back to last spring. I
began to encourage King Argaven to wait, to make no decision concerning
you or your mission, about a halfmonth before the day of the Ceremony of
the Keystone. The audience was already planned, and it seemed best to go
through with it, though without looking for any results from it. All
this I thought you understood, and in that I erred. I took too much for
granted;/1 didn’t wish to offend you, to advise you; I thought you
understood the danger of Pemmer Harge rem ir Tibe’s sudden ascendancy in
the kyorremy. If Tibe had known any good reason to fear you, he would
have accused you of serving a faction, and Argaven, who is very easily
moved by fear, would likely have had you murdered. I wanted you down,
and safe, while Tibe was up and powerful. As it chanced, I went down
with you. I was bound to fall, though I didn’t know it would be that
very night we talked together; but no one is Argaven’s prime minister
for long. After I received the Order of Exile I could not communicate
with you lest I contaminate you with my disgrace, and so increase your
peril. I came here to Orgoreyn. I tried to suggest to you that you
should also come to Orgoreyn. I urged the men I distrusted least among
the Thirty-Three Commensals to grant you entry; you would not have got
it without their favor. They saw, and I encouraged them to see, in you a
way towards power, a way out of the increasing rivalry with Karhide and
back towards the restoration of open trade, a chance perhaps to break
the grip of the Sarf. But they are over-cautious men, afraid to act.
Instead of proclaiming you, they hid you, and so lost their chance, and
sold you to the Sarf to save their own pelts. I counted too much on
them, and therefore the fault is mine.”</p>
<p>“But for what purpose-all this intriguing, this hiding and
power-seeking and plotting-what was it all for, Es-traven? What were you
after?”</p>
<p>“I was after what you’re after: the alliance of my world with your
worlds. What did you think?”</p>
<p>We were staring at each other across the glowing stove like a pair of
wooden dolls.</p>
<p>“You mean, even if it was Orgoreyn that made the alliance-?”</p>
<p>“Even if it was Orgoreyn. Karhide would soon have followed. Do you
think I would play shifgrethor when so much is at stake for all of us,
all my fellow men? What does it matter which country wakens first, so
long as we waken?”</p>
<p>“How the devil can I believe anything you say!” he burst out. Bodily
weakness made his indignation sound aggrieved and whining. “If all this
is true, you might have explained some of it earlier, last spring, and
spared us both a trip to Pulefen. Your efforts on my behalf-”</p>
<p>“Have failed. And have put you in pain, and shame, and danger. I know
it. But if I had tried to fight Tibe for your sake, you would not be
here now, you’d be in a grave in Erhenrang. And there are now a few
people in Karhide, and a few in Orgoreyn, who believe your story,
because they listened to me. They may yet serve you. My greatest error
was, as you say, in not making myself clear to you. I am not used to
doing so. I am not used to giving, or accepting, either advice or
blame.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to be unjust, Estraven-”</p>
<p>“Yet you are. It is strange. I am the only man in all Gethen that has
trusted you entirely, and I am the only man in Gethen that you have
refused to trust.”</p>
<p>He put his head in his hands. He said at last, “I’m sorry, Estraven.”
It was both apology and admission.</p>
<p>“The fact is,” I said, “that you’re unable, or unwilling, to I
believe in the fact that I believe in you.” I stood up, for my legs were
cramped, and found I was trembling with anger and weariness. “Teach me
your mindspeech,” I said, trying to speak easily and with no rancor,
“your language that has no lies in it. Teach me that, and then ask me
why I did what I’ve done.”</p>
<p>“I should like to do that, Estraven.”</p>
