<h4 id="between-drumner-and-dremegole">16. Between Drumner and
Dremegole</h4>
<p>Odyrny Thern. Ai asks from his sleeping-bag, “What is it you’re
writing, Harth?”</p>
<p>“A record.”</p>
<p>He laughs a little. “I ought to be keeping a journal for the
Ekumenical files; but I never could stick to it without a
voice-writer.”</p>
<p>I explain that my notes are intended for my people at Estre, who will
incorporate them as they see fit into the Records of the Domain; this
turning my thoughts to my Hearth and my son, I seek to turn them away
again, and ask, “Your parent-your parents, that is-are they alive?”</p>
<p>“No,” says Ai. “Seventy years dead.”</p>
<p>I puzzled at it. Ai was not thirty years old. “You’re counting years
of a different length than ours?”</p>
<p>“No. Oh, I see. I’ve time-jumped. Twenty years from Earth to
Hain-Davenant, from there fifty to Ellul, from Ellul to here seventeen.
I’ve only lived off-Earth seven years, but I was born there a hundred
and twenty years ago.”</p>
<p>Long since in Erhenrang he had explained to me how time is shortened
inside the ships that go almost as fast as starlight between the stars,
but I had not laid this fact down against the length of a man’s life, or
the lives he leaves behind him on his own world. While he lived a few
hours in one of those unimaginable ships going from one planet to
another, everyone he had left behind him at home grew old and died, and
their children grew old. … I said at last, “I thought myself an
exile.”</p>
<p>“You for my sake-I for yours,” he said, and laughed again, a slight
cheerful sound in the heavy silence. These three days since we came down
from the pass have been much hard work for no gain, but Ai is no longer
downcast, nor over hopeful; and he has more patience with me. Maybe the
drugs are sweated out of him. Maybe we have learned to pull
together.</p>
<p>We spent this day coming down from the basaltic spur which we spent
yesterday climbing. From the valley it looked a good road up onto the
Ice, but the higher we went the more scree and slick rock-face we met,
and a grade ever steeper, till even without the sledge we could not have
climbed it. Tonight we are back down at the foot of it in the moraine,
the valley of stones. Nothing grows here. Rock, pebble-dump,
boulder-fields, clay, mud. An arm of the glacier has withdrawn from this
slope within the last fifty or hundred years, leaving the planet’s bones
raw to the air; no flesh of earth, of grass. Here and there fumaroles
cast a heavy yellowish fog over the ground, low and creeping. The air
smells of sulphur. It is 12°, still, overcast. I hope no heavy snow
falls until we have got over the evil ground between this place and the
glacier-arm we saw some miles to the west from the ridge. It seems to be
a wide ice-river running down from the plateau between two mountains,
volcanoes, both capped with steam and smoke. If we can get onto it from
the slopes of the nearer volcano, it may provide us a road up onto the
plateau of ice. To our east a smaller glacier comes down to a frozen
lake, but it runs curving and even from here the great crevasses in it
can be seen; it is impassible to us, equipped as we are. We agreed to
try the glacier between the volcanoes, though by going west to it we
lose at least two days’ mileage towards our goal, one in going west and
one in regaining the distance.</p>
<p>Opposthe Thern . Snowing neserem’*</p>
<p>*neserem: fine snow on a moderate gale: a light blizzard.</p>
<p>No travel in this. We both slept all day. We have been hauling nearly
a halfmonth, the sleep does us good.</p>
<p>Ottormenbod Thern. Snowing neserem. Enough sleep. Ai taught me a
Terran game played on squares with little stones, called go, an
excellent difficult game. As he remarked, there are plenty of stones
here to play go with.</p>
<p>He endures the cold pretty well, and if courage were enough, would
stand it like a snow-worm. It is odd to see him bundled up in hieb and
overcoat with the hood up, when the temperature is above zero; but when
we sledge, if the sun is out or the wind not too bitter, he takes off
the coat soon and sweats like one of us. We must compromise as to the
heating of the tent. He would keep it hot, I cold, and other’s comfort
is the other’s pneumonia. We strike a medium, and he shivers outside his
bag, while I swelter in mine; but considering from what distances we
have come together to share this tent a while, we do well enough.</p>
<p>Getheny Thanern .Clear after the blizzard, wind down, the thermometer
around 15° all day. We are camped on the lower western slope of the
nearer volcano: Mount Dremegole, on my map of Orgoreyn. Its companion
across the ice-river is called Drumner. The map is poorly made; there is
a great peak visible to the west not shown on it at all, and it is all
out of proportion. The Orgota evidently do not often come into their
Fire-Hills. Indeed there is not much to come for, except grandeur. We
hauled eleven miles today, difficult work: all rock. Ai is asleep
already. I bruised the tendon of my heel, wrenching it like a fool when
my foot was caught between two boulders, and limped out the afternoon.
The night’s rest should heal it. Tomorrow we should get down onto the
glacier.</p>
<p>Our food-supplies seem to have sunk alarmingly, but it is because we
have been eating the bulky stuff. We had between ninety and a hundred
pounds of coarse foodstuffs, half of it the load I stole in Turuf; sixty
pounds of this are gone, after fifteen days’ journey. I have started on
the gichy-michy at a pound a day, saving two sacks of kadik-germ, some
sugar, and a chest of dried fishcakes for variety later. I am glad to be
rid of that heavy stuff from Turuf. The sledge pulls lighter.</p>
<p>Sordny Thanern. In the 20’s; frozen rain, wind pouring down the
ice-river like the draft in a tunnel. Camped a quarter mile in from the
edge, on a long flat streak of firn. The way down from Dremegole was
rough and steep, on bare rock and rock-fields; the glacier’s edge
heavily crevassed, and so foul with gravel and rocks caught in the ice
that we tried the sledge on wheels there too. Before we had got a
hundred yards a wheel wedged fast and the axle bent. We use runners
henceforth. We made only four miles today, still in the wrong direction.
The effluent glacier seems to run on a long curve westerly up to the
Gobrin plateau. Here between the volcanoes it is about four miles wide,
and should not be hard going farther in towards the center, though it is
more crevassed than I had hoped, and the surface rotten.</p>
<p>Drumner is in eruption. The sleet on one’s lips tastes of smoke and
sulphur. A darkness loured all day in the west even under the
rainclouds. From time to time all things, clouds, icy rain, ice, air,
would turn a dull red, then fade slowly back to gray. The glacier shakes
a little under our feet.</p>
<p>Eskichwe rem ir Her hypothesized that the volcanic activity in N.W.
Orgoreyn and the Archipelago has been increasing during the last ten or
twenty millennia, and presages the end of the Ice, or at least a
recession of it and an interglacial period. CO2 released by the
volcanoes into the atmosphere will in time serve as an insulator,
holding in the longwave heat-energy reflected from the earth, while
permitting direct solar heat to enter undiminished. The average world
temperature, he says, would in the end be raised some thirty degrees,
till it attains 72°. I am glad I shall not be present. Ai says that
similar theories have been propounded by Terran scholars to explain the
still incomplete recession of their last Age of Ice. All such theories
remain largely irrefutable and unprovable; no one knows certainly why
the ice comes, why it goes. The Snow of Ignorance remains untrodden.</p>
<p>Over Drumner in the dark now a great table of dull fire burns.</p>
<p>Eps Thanern. The meter reads sixteen miles hauled today, but we are
not more than eight miles in a straight line from last night’s camp. We
are still in the ice-pass between the two volcanoes. Drumner is in
eruption. Worms of fire crawl down its black sides, seen when wind
clears off the roil and seethe of ash-cloud and smoke-cloud and white
steam. Continuously, with no pause, a hissing mutter fills the air, so
huge and so long a sound that one cannot hear it when one stops to
listen; yet it fills all the interstices of one’s being. The glacier
trembles perpetually, snaps and crashes, jitters under our feet. All the
snowbridges that the blizzard may have laid across crevasses are gone,
shaken down, knocked in by this drumming and jumping of the ice and the
earth beneath the ice. We go back and forth, seeking the end of a slit
in the ice that would swallow the sledge whole, then seeking the end of
the next, trying to go north and forced always to go west or east. Above
us Dremegole, in sympathy with Drum-ner’s labor, grumbles and farts foul
smoke.</p>
<p>Ai’s face was badly frostbitten this morning, nose, ears, chin all
dead gray when I chanced to look at him. Kneaded him back to life and no
damage done, but we must be more careful. The wind that blows down off
the Ice is, in simple truth, deadly; and we have to face it as we
haul.</p>
<p>I shall be glad to get off this slit and wrinkled ice-arm between
two” growling monsters. Mountains should be seen, not heard.</p>
<p>Arhad Thanern. Some sove-snow, between 15 and 20°. We went twelve
miles today, about five of them profitable, and the rim of the Gobrin is
visibly nearer, north, above us. We now see the ice-river to be miles
wide: the “arm” between Drumner and Dremegole is only one finger, and we
now are on the back of the hand. Turning and looking down from this camp
one sees the glacier-flow split, divided, torn and churned by the black
steaming peaks that thwart it. Looking ahead one sees it broaden, rising
and curving slowly, dwarfing the dark ridges of earth, meeting the
ice-wall far above under veils of cloud and smoke and snow. Cinders and
ash now fall with the snow, and the ice is thick with clinkers on it or
sunk in it: a good walking surface but rather rough for hauling, and the
runners need recoating already. Two or three times volcanic projectiles
hit the ice quite near us. They hiss loudly as they strike, and burn
themselves a socket in the ice. Cinders patter, falling with the snow.
We creep infmitesimally northward through the dirty chaos of a world in
the process of making itself.</p>
<p>Praise then Creation unfinished!</p>
<p>Netherhad Thanern. No snow since morning; overcast and windy, at
about 15°. The great multiple glacier we are on feeds down into the
valley from the west, and we are on its extreme eastern edge. Dremegole
and Drumner are now somewhat behind us, though a sharp ridge of
Dremegole still rises east of us, almost at eye-level. We have crept and
crawled up to a point where we must choose between following the glacier
on its long sweep westward and so up gradually onto the plateau of ice,
or climbing the ice-cliffs a mile north of tonight’s camp, and so saving
twenty or thirty miles of hauling, at the cost of risk.</p>
<p>Ai favors the risk.</p>
<p>There is a frailty about him. He is all unprotected, exposed,
vulnerable, even to his sexual organ which he must carry always outside
himself; but he is strong, unbelievably strong. I am not sure he can
keep hauling any longer than I can, but he can haul harder and faster
than I-twice as hard. He can lift the sledge at front or rear to ease it
over an obstacle. I could not lift and hold that weight, unless I was in
dothe. To match his frailty and strength, he has a spirit easy to
despair and quick to defiance: a fierce impatient courage. This slow,
hard, crawling work we have been doing these days wears him out in body
and will, so that if he were one of my race I should think him a
coward,but he is anything but that; he has a ready bravery I have never
seen the like of. He is ready, eager, to stake life on the cruel quick
test of the precipice.</p>
<p>“Fire and fear, good servants, bad lords.” He makes fear serve him. I
would have let fear lead me around by the long way. Courage and reason
are with him. What good seeking the safe course, on a journey such as
this? There are senseless courses, which I shall not take; but there is
no safe one.</p>
<p>Streth Thanern. No luck. No way to get the sledge up, though we spent
the day at it.</p>
<p>Sove-snow in flurries, thick ash mixed with it. It was dark all day,
as the wind veering around from the west again blew the pall of
Drumner’s smoke on us. Up here the ice shakes less, but there came a
great quake while we tried to climb a shelving cliff; it shook free the
sledge where we had wedged it and I was pulled down five or six feet
with a bump, but Ai had a good handhold and his strength saved us from
all careering down to the foot of the cliff, twenty feet or more. If one
of us breaks a leg or shoulder in these exploits, that is probably the
end of both of us; there, precisely, is the risk-rather an ugly one when
looked at closely. The lower valley of the glaciers behind us is white
with steam: lava touches ice, down there. We certainly cannot go back.
Tomorrow we shall try the ascent farther west.</p>
<p>Beren Thanern. No luck. We must go farther west. Dark as late
twilight all day. Our lungs are raw, not from cold (it remains well
above zero even at night, with this west wind) but from breathing the
ash and fumes of the eruption. By the end of this second day of wasted
effort, scrabbling and squirming over pressure-blocks and up ice-cliffs
always to be stopped by a sheer face or overhang, trying farther on and
failing again, Ai was exhausted and enraged. He looked ready to cry, but
did not. I believe he considers crying either evil or shameful. Even
when he was very ill and weak, the first days of our escape, he hid his
face from me when he wept. Reasons personal, racial, social, sexual-how
can I guess why Ai must not weep? Yet his name is a cry of pain. For
that I first sought him out in Erhenrang, a long time age* it seems now;
hearing talk of “an Alien” I asked his name, and heard for answer a cry
of pain from a human throat across the night. Now he sleeps. His arms
tremble and twitch, muscular fatigue. The world around us, ice and rock,
ash and snow, fire and dark, trembles and twitches and mutters. Looking
out a minute ago I saw the glow of the volcano as a dull red bloom on
the belly of vast clouds overhanging the darkness.</p>
<p>Orny Thanern. No luck. This is the twenty-second day of our journey,
and since the tenth day we have made no progress eastward, indeed have
lost twenty or twenty-five miles by going west; since the eighteenth day
we have made no progress of any kind, and might as well have sat still.
If we ever do get up on the Ice, will we have food enough left to take
us across it? This thought is hard to dismiss. Fog and murk of the
eruption cut seeing very close, so that we cannot choose our path well.
Ai wants to attack each ascent, however “steep, that shows any sign of
shelving. He is impatient with my caution. We have got to watch our
tempers. I will be in kemmer in a day or so, and all strains will
increase. Meanwhile we butt our heads on cliffs of ice in a cold dusk
full of ashes. If I wrote a new Yomesh Canon I should send thieves here
after death. Thieves who steal sacks of food by night in Turuf. Thieves
who steal a man’s hearth and name from him and send_him out ashamed and
exiled. My head is thick, I must cross out all this stuff later, too
tired to reread it now.</p>
<p>Harhahad Thanern. On the Gobrin. The twenty-third day of our journey.
We are on the Gobrin Ice. As soon as we set out this morning we saw,
only a few hundred yards beyond last night’s camp, a pathway open up to
the Ice, a highway curving broad and cinder-paved from the rubble and
chasms of the glacier right up through the cliffs of ice. We walked up
it as if strolling along the Sess Embankment. We are on the Ice. We are
headed east again, homeward.</p>
<p>I am infected by Ai’s pure pleasure in our achievement. Looked at
soberly it is as bad as ever, up here. We are on the plateau’s rim.
Crevasses-some wide enough to sink villages in, not house by house but
all at once-run inland, northward, right out of sight. Most of them cut
across our way, so we too must go north, not east. The surface is bad.
We screw the sledge along amongst great lumps and chunks of ice, immense
debris pushed up by the straining of the great plastic sheet of ice
against and among the Fire-Hills. The broken pressure-ridges take queer
shapes, overturned towers, legless giants, catapults. A mile thick to
start with, the Ice here rises and thickens, trying to flow over the
mountains and choke the fire-mouths with silence. Some miles to the
north a peak rises up out of the Ice, the sharp graceful barren cone of
a young volcano: younger by thousands of years than the ice-sheet that
grinds and shoves, all shattered into chasms and jammed up into great
blocks and ridges, over the six thousand feet of lower slopes-we cannot
see.</p>
<p>During the day, turning, we saw the smoke of Drum-ner’s eruption hang
behind us like a gray-brown extension of the surface of the Ice. A
steady wind blows along at ground level from the northeast, clearing
this higher air of the soot and stink of the planet’s bowels which we
have breathed for days, flattening out the smoke behind us to cover,
like a dark lid, the glaciers, the lower mountains, the valleys of
stones, the rest of the earth. There is nothing, the Ice says, but Ice.
-But the young volcano there to northward has another word it thinks of
saying.</p>
<p>No snowfall, a thin high overcast. -4° on the plateau at dusk. A
jumble of firn, new ice, and old ice underfoot. The new ice is tricky,
slick blue stuff just hidden by a white glaze. We have both been down a
good deal. I slid fifteen feet on my belly across one such slick. Ai, in
harness, doubled up laughing. He apologized and explained he had thought
himself the only person on Gethen who ever slipped on ice.</p>
<p>Thirteen miles today; but if we try to keep up such a pace among
these cut, heaped, crevassed pressure-ridges we shall wear ourselves out
or come to worse grief than a belly-slide.</p>
<p>The waxing moon is low, dull as dry blood; a great brownish,
iridescent halo surrounds it.</p>
<p>Guyrny Thanern. Some snow, rising wind and falling temperature.
Thirteen miles again today, which brings our distance logged since we
left our first camp to 254 miles. We have averaged about ten and a half
miles a day; eleven and a half omitting the two days spent waiting out
the blizzard. 75 to 100 of those miles of hauling gave us no onward
gain. We are not much nearer Karhide than we were when we set out. But
we stand a better chance, I think, of getting there.</p>
<p>Since we came up out of the volcano-murk our spirit is not all spent
in work and worry, and we talk again in the tent after our dinner. As I
am in kemmer I would find it easier to ignore Ai’s presence, but this is
difficult in a two-man tent. The trouble is of course that tee is, in
his curious fashion, also in kemmer: always in kemmer. A strange
lowgrade sort of desire it must be, to be spread out over every day of
the year and never to know the choice of sex, but there it is; and here
am I. Tonight my extreme physical awareness of him was rather hard to
ignore, and I was too tired to divert it into untrance or any other
channel of the discipline. Finally he asked, had he offended me? I
explained my silence, with some embarrassment. I was afraid he would
laugh at me. After all he is no more an oddity, a sexual freak, than I
am: up here on the Ice each of us is singular, isolate, I as cut off
from those like me, from my society and its rules, as he from his. There
is no world full of other Gethenians here to explain and support my
existence. We are equals at last, equal, alien, alone. He did not laugh,
of course. Rather he spoke with a gentleness that I did not know was in
him. After a while he too came to speak of isolation, of loneliness.</p>
<p>“Your race is appallingly alone in its world. No other mammalian
species. No other ambisexual species. No animal intelligent enough even
to domesticate as pets. It must color your thinking, this uniqueness. I
don’t mean scientific thinking only, though you are extraordinary
hypothesizers-it’s extraordinary that you arrived at any concept of
evolution, faced with that unbridgeable gap between yourselves and the
lower animals. But philosophically, emotionally: to be so solitary, in
so hostile a world: it must affect your entire outlook.”</p>
<p>“The Yomeshta would say that man’s singularity is his divinity.”</p>
<p>“Lords of the Earth, yes. Other cults on other worlds have come to
the same conclusion. They tend to be the cults of dynamic, aggressive,
ecology-breaking cultures.</p>
<p>Orgoreyn is in the pattern, in its way; at least they seem bent on
pushing things around. What do the Hand-darata say?”</p>
<p>“Well, in the Handdara . . . you know, there’s no theory, no dogma. .
. . Maybe they are less aware of the gap between men and beasts, being
more occupied with the likenesses, the links, the whole of which living
things are a part.” Termer’s Lay had been all day ia my mind, and I said
the words,</p>
<p>Light is the left hand of darkness</p>
<p>and darkness the right hand of light.</p>
<p>Two are one, life and death, lying</p>
<p>together like lovers in kemmer,</p>
<p>like hands joined together,</p>
<p>like the end and the way.</p>
<p>My voice shook as I said the lines, for I remembered as I said them
that in the letter my brother wrote me before his death he had quoted
the same words.</p>
<p>Ai brooded, and after some time he said, “You’re isolated, and
undivided. Perhaps you are as obsessed with wholeness as we are with
dualism.”</p>
<p>“We are dualists too. Duality is an essential, isn’t it? So long as
there is myself and the other.”</p>
<p>“I and Thou,” he said. “Yes, it does, after all, go even wider than
sex. …”</p>
<p>“Tell me, how does the other sex of your race differ from yours?”</p>
<p>He looked startled and in fact my question rather startled me; kemmer
brings out these spontaneities in one. We were both self-conscious. “I
never thought of that,” he said. “You’ve never seen a woman.” He used
his Ter-ran-language word, which I knew.</p>
<p>“I saw your pictures of them. The women looked like pregnant
Gethenians, but with larger breasts. Do they differ much from your sex
in mind behavior? Are they like a different species?”</p>
<p>“No. Yes. No, of course not, not really. But the difference is very
important. I suppose the most important thing, the heaviest single
factor in one’s life, is whether one’s born male or female. In most
societies it determines one’s expectations, activities, outlook, ethics,
manners-almost everything. Vocabulary. Semiotic usages. Clothing. Even
food. Women . . . women tend to eat less. . . . It’s extremely hard to
separate the innate differences from the learned ones. Even where women
participate equally with men in the society, they still after all do all
the childbearing, and so most of the child-rearing. .. .”</p>
<p>“Equality is not the general rule, then? Are they mentally
inferior?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. They don’t often seem to turn up mathematicians, or
composers of music, or inventors, or abstract thinkers. But it isn’t
that they’re stupid. Physically they’re less muscular, but a little more
durable than men. Psychologically-”</p>
<p>After he had stared a long time at the glowing stove, he shook his
head. “Harth,” he said, “I can’t tell you what women are like. I never
thought about it much in the abstract, you know, and-God!-by now I’ve
practically forgotten. I’ve been here two years. . . . You don’t know.
In a sense, women are more alien to me than you are. With you I share
one sex, anyhow. . . .” He looked away and laughed, rueful and uneasy.
My own feelings were complex, and we let the matter drop.</p>
<p>Yrny Thanern. Eighteen miles today, east-northeast by compass, on
skis. We got clear of the pressure-ridges and crevasses in the first
hour of pulling. Both got in harness, I ahead at first with the probe,
but no more need for testing: the firn is a couple of feet thick over
solid ice, and on the firn lie several inches of sound new snow from the
last fall, with a good surface. Neither we nor the sledge broke through
at all, and the sledge pulled so light that it was hard to believe we
are still hauling about a hundred pounds apiece. During the afternoon we
took turns hauling, as one can do it easily on this splendid surface. It
is a pity that all the hard work uphill and over rock came while the
load was heavy. Now we go light. Too light: I find myself thinking about
food a good deal. We eat, Ai says, ethereally. All day we went light and
fast over the level ice-plain, dead white under a gray-blue sky,
unbroken except for the few black nuna-tak-peaks now far behind us, and
a smudge of darkness, Drumner’s breath, behind them. Nothing else: the
veiled sun, the ice.</p>
