<h4 id="an-orgota-creation-myth">17. An Orgota Creation Myth</h4>
<p>The origins of this myth are prehistorical; it has been recorded in
many forms. This very primitive version is from a pre-Yomesh written
text found in the Isenpeth Cave Shrine of the Gobrin Hinterlands.</p>
<p>In the beginning there was nothing but ice and the sun. Over many
years the sun shining melted a great crevasse in the ice. In the sides
of this crevasse were great shapes of ice, and there was no bottom to
it. Drops of water melted from the ice-shapes in the sides of the chasm
and fell down and down. One of the ice-shapes said, “I bleed.” Another
of the ice-shapes said, “I weep.” A third one said, “I sweat.”</p>
<p>The ice-shapes climbed up out of the abyss and stood on the plain of
ice. He that said “I bleed,” he reached up to the sun and pulled out
handfuls of excrement from the bowels of the sun, and with that dung
made the hills and valleys of the earth. He that said “I weep,” he
breathed on the ice and melting it made the seas and the rivers. He that
said “I sweat,” he gathered up soil and sea-water and with them made
trees, plants, herbs and grains of the field, animals, and men. The
plants grew in the soil and the sea, the beasts ran on the land and swam
in the sea, but the men did not wake. Thirty-nine of them there were.
They slept on the ice and would not move.</p>
<p>Then the three ice-shapes stooped down and sat with their knees drawn
up and let the sun melt them. As milk they melted, and the milk ran into
the mouths of the sleepers, and the sleepers woke. That milk is drunk by
the children of men alone and without it they will not wake to life.</p>
<p>The first to wake up was Edondurath. So tall was he that when he
stood up his head split the sky, and snow fell down. He saw the others
stirring and awakening, and was afraid of them when they moved, so he
killed one after another with a blow of his fist. Thirty-six of them he
killed. But one of them, the next to last one, ran away. Haharath he was
called. Far he ran over the plain of ice and over the lands of earth.
Edondurath ran behind him and caught up with him at last and smote him.
Haharath died. Then Edondurath returned to the Birthplace on the Gobrin
Ice where the bodies of the others lay, but the last one was gone: he
had escaped while Edondurath pursued Haharath.</p>
<p>Edondurath built a house of the frozen bodies of his brothers, and
waited there inside that house for that last one to come back. Each day
one of the corpses would speak, saying, “Does he burn? Does he burn?”
All the other corpses would say with frozen tongues, “No, no.” Then
Edondurath entered kemmer as he slept, and moved and spoke aloud in
dreams, and when he woke the corpses were all saying, “He burns! He
burns!” And the last brother, the youngest one, heard them saying that,
and came into the house of bodies and there coupled with Edondurath. Of
these two were the nations of men born, out of the flesh of Edondurath,
out of Edondurath’s womb. The name of the other, the younger brother,
the father, his name is not known.</p>
<p>Each of the children born to them had a piece of darkness that
followed him about wherever he went by daylight. Edondurath said, “Why
are my sons followed thus by darkness?” His kemmering said, “Because
they were born in the house of flesh, therefore death follows at their
heels. They are in the middle of time. In the beginning there was the
sun and the ice, and there was no shadow. In the end when we are done,
the sun will devour itself and shadow will eat light, and there will be
nothing left but the ice and the darkness.”</p>
