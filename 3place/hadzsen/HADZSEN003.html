<h4 id="the-place-inside-the-blizzard">2. The Place Inside the
Blizzard</h4>
<p>From a sound-tape collection of North Karhidish “hearth-tales” in the
archives of the College of Historians in Erhenrang, narrator unknown,
recorded during the reign of Argaven VIII.</p>
<p>About two hundred years ago in the Hearth of Shath in the Pering
Storm-border there were two brothers who vowed kemmering to each other.
In those days, as now, full brothers were permitted to keep kemmer until
one of them should bear a child, but after that they must separate; so
it was never permitted them to vow kemmering for life. Yet this they had
done. When a child was conceived the Lord of Shath commanded them to
break their vow and never meet in kemmer again. On hearing this command
one of the two, the one who bore the child, despaired and would hear no
comfort or counsel, and procuring poison, committed suicide.</p>
<p>Then the people of the Hearth rose up against the other brother and
drove him out of Hearth and Domain, laying the shame of the suicide upon
him. And since his own lord had exiled him and his story went before
him, none would take him in, but after the three days’ guesting all sent
him from their doors as an outlaw. So from place to place he went until
he saw that there was no kindness left for him in his own land, and his
crime would not be forgiven.*</p>
<p>*His transgression of the code controlling incest became a crime when
seen as the cause of his brother’s suicide. (G.A.)</p>
<p>He had not believed this would be so, being a young man and
unhardened. When he saw that it was so indeed, he returned over the land
to Shath and as an exile stood in the doorway of the Outer Hearth. This
he said to his hearth-fellows there: “I am without a face among men. I
am not seen. I speak and am not heard. I come and am not welcomed. There
is no place by the fire for me, nor food on the table for me, nor a bed
made for me to lie in. Yet I still have my name: Getheren is my name.
That name I lay on this Hearth as a curse, and with it my shame. Keep
that for me. Now nameless I will go seek my death.” Then some of the
hearth men jumped up with, shouts and tumult, intending to kill him, for
murder is a lighter shadow on a house than suicide. He escaped them and
ran northward over the land towards the Ice, outrunning all who pursued
him. They came back all chapfallen to Shath. But Getheren went on, and
after two days’ journey came to the Pering Ice.**</p>
<p>**The Pering Ice is the glacial sheet that covers the northernmost
portion of Karhide, and is (in winter when the Guthen Bay is frozen)
contiguous with the Gobrin Ice of Orgoreyn.</p>
<p>For two days he walked northward on the Ice. He had no food with him,
nor shelter but his coat. On the Ice nothing grows and no beasts run. It
was the month of Susmy and the first great snows were falling those days
and nights. He went alone through the storm. On the second day he knew
he was growing weaker. On the second night he must lie down and sleep a
while. On the third morning waking he saw that his hands were
frostbitten, and found that his feet were too, though he could not
unfasten his boots to look at them, having no use left of his hands. He
began to crawl forward on knees and elbows. He had no reason to do so,
as it did not matter whether he died in one place on the Ice or another,
but he felt that he should go northward.</p>
<p>After a long while the snow ceased to fall around him, and the wind
to blow. The sun shone out. He could not see far ahead as he crawled,
for the fur of his hood came forward over his eyes. No longer feeling
any cold in his legs and arms nor on his face, he thought that the frost
had benumbed him. Yet he could still move. The snow that lay over the
glacier looked strange to him, as if it were a white grass growing up
out of the ice. It bent to his touch and straightened again, like
grass-blades. He ceased to crawl and sat up, pushing back his hood so he
could see around him. As far as he could see lay fields of the
snowgrass, white and shining. There were groves of white trees, with
white leaves growing on them. The sun shone, and it was windless, and
everything was white.</p>
<p>Getheren took off his gloves and looked at his hands. They were white
as the snow. Yet the frostbite was gone out of them, and he could use
his fingers, and stand upon his feet. He felt no pain, and no cold, and
no hunger.</p>
<p>He saw away over the ice to the north a white tower like the tower of
a Domain, and from this place far away one came walking towards him.
After a while Getheren could see that the person was naked, his skin was
all white, and his hair was all white. He came nearer, and near enough
to speak. Getheren said, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>The white man said, “I am your brother and kemmering, Hode.”</p>
<p>Hode was the name of his brother who had killed himself. And Getheren
saw that the white man was his brother in body and feature. But there
was no longer any life in his belly, and his voice sounded thin like the
creaking of ice.</p>
<p>Getheren asked, “What place is this?”</p>
<p>Hode answered, “This is the place inside the blizzard. We who kill
ourselves dwell here. Here you and I shall keep our vow.”</p>
<p>Getheren was frightened, and he said, “I will not stay here. If you
had come away with me from our Hearth into the southern lands we might
have stayed together and kept our vow lifelong, no man knowing our
transgression. But you broke your vow, throwing it away with your life.
And now you cannot say my name.”</p>
<p>This was true. Hode moved his white lips, but could not say his
brother’s name.</p>
<p>He came quickly to Getheren reaching out his arms to hold him, and
seized him by the left hand. Getheren broke free and ran from him. He
ran to the southward, and running saw rise up before him a white wall of
falling snow, and when he entered into it he fell again on his knees,
and could not run, but crawled.</p>
<p>On the ninth day after he had gone up on the Ice he was found in
their Domain by people of Orhoch Hearth, which lies northeast of Shath.
They did not know who he was nor where he came from, for they found him
crawling in the snow, starving, snowblind, his face blackened by sun and
frost, and at first he could not speak. Yet he took no lasting harm
except in his left hand, which was frozen and must be amputated. Some of
the people there said this was Getheren of Shath, of whom they had heard
talk; others said it could not be, for that Getheren had gone up on the
Ice in the first blizzard of autumn, and was certainly dead. He himself
denied that his name was Getheren. When he was well he left Orhoch and
the Storm-border and went into the southern lands, calling himself
Ennoch.</p>
<p>When Ennoch was an old man dwelling in the plains of Rer he met a man
from his own country, and asked him, “How fares Shath Domain?” The other
told him that Shath fared ill. Nothing prospered there in hearth or
tilth, all being blighted with illness, the spring seed frozen in the
ground or the ripe grain rotten, and so it had been for many years. Then
Ennoch told him, “I am Getheren of Shath,” and told him how he had gone
up on the Ice and what he had met with there. At the end of his tale he
said, “Tell them at Shath that I take back my name and my shadow.” Not
many days after this Getheren took sick and died. The traveler carried
his words back to Shath, and they say that from that time on the domain
prospered again, and all went as it should go in field and house and
hearth.</p>
