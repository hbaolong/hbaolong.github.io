<h4 id="a-fools-errand">20. A Fool’s Errand</h4>
<p>Somewhere in the notes Estraven wrote during our trek across the
Gobrin Ice he wonders why his companion is ashamed to cry. I could have
told him even then that it was not shame so much as fear. Now I went on
through the Sinoth Valley, through the evening of his death, into the
cold country that lies beyond fear. There I found you can weep all you
like, but there’s no good in it.</p>
<p>I was taken back to Sassinoth and imprisoned, because I had been in
the company of an outlaw, and probably because they did not know what
else to do with me. From the start, even before official orders came
from Erhenrang, they treated me well. My Karhidish jail was a furnished
room in the Tower of the Lords-Elect in Sassinoth; I had a fireplace, a
radio, and five large meals daily. It was not comfortable. The bed was
hard, the covers thin, the floor bare, the air cold-like any room in
Karhide. But they sent in a physician, in whose hands and voice was a
more enduring, a more profitable comfort than any I ever found in
Orgoreyn. After he came, I think the door was left unlocked. I recall it
standing open, and myself wishing it were shut, because of the chill
draft of air from the hall. But I had not the strength, the courage, to
get off my bed and shut my prison door.</p>
<p>The physician, a grave, maternal young fellow, told me with an air of
peaceable certainty, “You have been underfed and overtaxed for five or
six months. You have spent yourself. There’s nothing more to spend. Lie
down, rest. Lie down like the rivers frozen in the valleys in winter.
Lie still. Wait.”</p>
<p>But when I slept I was always in the truck, huddling together with
the others, all of us stinking, shivering, naked, squeezed together for
warmth, all but one. One lay by himself against the barred door, the
cold one, with a mouth full of clotted blood. He was the traitor. He had
gone on by himself, deserting us, deserting me. I would wake up full of
rage, a feeble shaky rage that turned into feeble tears.</p>
<p>I must have been rather ill, for I remember some of the effects of
high fever, and the physician stayed with me one night or perhaps more.
I can’t recall those nights, but do remember saying to him, and hearing
the querulous keening note in my own voice, “He could have stopped. He
saw the guards. He ran right into the guns.”</p>
<p>The young physician said nothing for a while. “You’re not saying that
he killed himself?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps-”</p>
<p>“That’s a bitter thing to say of a friend. And I will not believe it
of Harth rem ir Estraven.”</p>
<p>I had not had in mind when I spoke the contemptibility of suicide to
these people. It is not to them, as to us, an option. It is the
abdication from option, the act of betrayal itself. To a Karhider
reading our canons, the crime of Judas lies not in his betrayal of
Christ but in the act that, sealing despair, denies the chance of
forgiveness, change, life: his suicide. “Then you don’t call him
Estraven the Traitor?”</p>
<p>“Nor ever did. There are many who never heeded the accusations
against him, Mr. Ai.”</p>
<p>But I was unable to see any solace in that, and only cried out in the
same torment, “Then why did they shoot him? Why is he dead?” To this he
made no answer, there being none. I was never formally interrogated.
They asked how I had got out of Pulefen Farm and into Karhide, and they
asked the destination and intent of the code message I had sent on their
radio. I told them. That information went straight to Erhenrang, to the
king. The matter of the ship was apparently held secret, but the news of
my escape from an Orgota prison, my journey over the Ice in winter, my
presence in Sassinoth, was freely reported and discussed. Estraven’s
part in this was not mentioned on the radio, nor was his death. Yet it
was known. Secrecy in Karhide is to an extraordinary extent a matter of
discretion, of an agreed, understood silence-an omission of questions,
yet not an omission of answers. The Bulletins spoke only of the Envoy
Mr. Ai, but everybody knew that it was Harth rem ir Estraven who had
stolen me from the hands of the Orgota and come with me over the Ice to
Karhide to give the staring lie to the Commensals’ tale of my sudden
death from horm-fever in Mishnory last autumn. . . . Estraven had
predicted the effects of my return fairly accurately; he had erred
mainly in underestimating them. Because of the alien who lay ill, not
acting, not caring, in a room in Sassinoth, two governments fell within
ten days.</p>
<p>To- say that an Orgota government fell means, of course, only that
one group of Commensals replaced another group of Commensals in the
controlling offices of the Thirty-Three. Some shadows got shorter and
some longer, as they say in Karhide. The Sarf faction that had sent me
off to Pulefen hung on, despite the not unprecedented embarrassment of
being caught lying, until Argaven’s public announcement of the imminent
arrival of the Star Ship in Karhide. That day Obsle’s party, the Open
Trade faction, took over the presiding offices of the Thirty-Three. So I
was of some service to them after all.</p>
<p>In Karhide the fall of a government is most likely to mean the
disgrace and replacement of a Prime Minister along with a reshuffling of
the kyorremy; although ’assassination, abdication, and insurrection are
all frequent alternatives. Tibe made no effort to hang on. My current
value in the game of international shifgrethor, plus my vindication (by
implication) of Estraven, gave me as it were a prestige-weight so
clearly surpassing his, that he resigned, as I later learned, even
before the Erhenrang Government knew that I had radioed to my ship. He
acted on the tip-off from Thessicher, waited only until he got word of
Estraven’s death, and then resigned. He had his defeat and his revenge
for it all in one.</p>
<p>Once Argaven was fully informed, he sent me a summons, a request to
come at once to Erhenrang, and along with it a liberal allowance for
expenses. The City of Sassinoth with equal liberality sent their young
physician along with me, for I was not in very good shape yet. We made
the trip in power-sledges. I remember only parts of it; it was smooth
and unhurried, with long halts waiting for packers to clear the road,
and long nights spent at inns. It could only have taken two or three
days, but it seemed a long trip and I can’t recall much of it till the
moment when we came through the Northern Gates of Erhenrang into the
deep streets full of snow and shadow.</p>
<p>I felt then that my heart hardened somewhat and my mind cleared. I
had been all in pieces, disintegrated. Now, though tired from the easy
journey, I found some strength left whole in me. Strength of habit, most
likely, for here at last was a place I knew, a city I had lived in,
worked in, for over a year. I knew the streets, the towers, the somber
courts and ways and facades of the Palace. I knew my job here. Therefore
for the first time it came plainly to me that, my friend being dead, I
must accomplish the thing he died for. I must set the keystone in the
arch.</p>
<p>At the Palace gates the order was for me to proceed to one of the
guest-houses within the Palace walls. It was the Round-Tower Dwelling,
which signaled a high degree of shifgrethor in the court: not so much
the king’s favor, as his recognition of a status already high.
Ambassadors from friendly powers were usually lodged there. It was a
good sign. To get to it, however, we had to pass by the Corner Red
Dwelling, and I looked in the narrow arched gateway at the bare tree
over the pool, gray with ice, and the house that still stood empty.</p>
<p>At the door of the Round-Tower I was met by a person in white hieb
and crimson shirt, with a silver chain over his shoulders: Faxe, the
Foreteller of Otherhord Fastness. At sight of his kind and handsome
face, the first known face that I had seen for many days, a rush of
relief softened my mood of strained resolution. When Faxe took my hands
in the rare Karhidish greeting and welcomed me as his friend, I could
make some response to his warmth.</p>
<p>He had been sent to the kyorremy from his district, South Rer, early
in the autumn. Election of council-members from the Indwellers of
Handdara Fastnesses is not uncommon; it is however not common for a
Weaver to accept office, and I believe Faxe would have refused if he had
not been much concerned by Tibe’s government and the direction in which
it was leading the country. So he had taken off the Weaver’s gold chain
and put on the councillor’s silver one; and he had not spent long in
making his mark, for he had been since Them a member of the Hes-kyorremy
or Inner Council, which serves as counterweight to the Prime Minister,
and it was the king who had named him to that position. He was perhaps
on his way up to the eminence from which Estraven, less than a year ago,
had fallen. Political careers in Karhide are abrupt, precipitous.</p>
<p>In the Round-Tower, a cold pompous little house, Faxe and I talked at
some length before I had to see anyone else or make any formal statement
or appearance. He asked with his clear gaze on me, “There is a ship
coming, then, coming down to earth: a larger ship than the one you came
to Horden Island on, three years ago. Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That is, I sent a message that should prepare it to come.”</p>
<p>“When will it come?”</p>
<p>When I realized that I did not even know what day of the month it
was, I began to realize how badly off I had in fact been, lately. I had
to count back to the day before Estraven’s death. When I found that the
ship, if it had been at minimum distance, would already be in planetary
orbit awaiting some word from me, I had another shock.</p>
<p>“I must communicate with the ship. They’ll want instructions. Where
does the king want them to come down? It should be an uninhabited area,
fairly large. I must get to a transmitter-”</p>
<p>Everything was arranged expeditiously, with ease. The endless
convolutions and frustrations of my previous dealings with the Erhenrang
Government were melted away like ice-pack in a flooding river. The wheel
turned. . . . Next day I was to have an audience with the king.</p>
<p>It had taken Estraven six months to arrange my first audience. It had
taken the rest of his life to arrange this second one.</p>
<p>I was too tired to be apprehensive, this time, and there were things
on my mind that outweighed self-consciousness. I went down the long red
hall under the dusty banners and stood -before the dais with its three
great hearths, where three bright fires cracked and sparkled. The king
sat by the central fireplace, hunched up on a carven stool by the
table.</p>
<p>“Sit down, Mr. Ai.”</p>
<p>I sat down across the hearth from Argaven, and saw his face in the
light of the flames. He looked unwell, and old. He looked like a woman
who has lost her baby, like a man who has lost his son.</p>
<p>“Well, Mr. Ai, so your ship’s going to land.”</p>
<p>“It will land in Athten Fen, as you requested, sir. They should bring
it down this evening at the beginning of Third Hour.”</p>
<p>“What if they miss the place? Will they burn everything up?”</p>
<p>“They’ll follow a radio-beam straight in; that’s all been arranged.
They won’t miss.”</p>
<p>“And how many of them are there-eleven? Is that right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Not enough to be afraid of, my lord.”</p>
<p>Argaven’s hands twitched in an unfinished gesture. “I am no longer
afraid of you, Mr. Ai.”</p>
<p>I’m glad of that.”</p>
<p>“You’ve served me well.”</p>
<p>“But I am not your servant.”</p>
<p>“I know it,” he said indifferently. He stared at the fire, chewing
the inside of his lip.</p>
<p>“My ansible transmitter is in the hands of the Sarf in Mishnory,
presumably. However, when the ship comes down it will have an ansible
aboard. I will have thenceforth, if acceptable to you, the position of
Envoy Plenipotentiary of the Ekumen, and will be empowered to discuss,
and sign, a treaty of alliance with Karhide. All this can be confirmed
with Hain and the various Stabilities by ansible.”</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>I said no more, for he was not giving me his whole attention. He
moved a log in the fire with his boot-toe, so that a few red sparks
crackled up from it. “Why the devil did he cheat me?” he demanded in his
high strident voice, and for the first time looked straight at me.</p>
<p>“Who?” I said, sending back his stare.</p>
<p>“Estraven.”</p>
<p>“He saw to it that you didn’t cheat yourself. He got me out of sight
when you began to favor a faction unfriendly to me. He brought me back
to you when my return would in itself persuade you to receive the
Mission of the Ekumen, and the credit for it.”</p>
<p>“Why did he never say anything about this larger ship to me?”</p>
<p>“Because he didn’t know about it: I never spoke to anyone of it until
I went to Orgoreyn.”</p>
<p>“And a fine lot you chose to blab to there, you two. He tried to get
the Orgota to receive your Mission. He was working with their Open
Traders all along. You’ll tell me that was not betrayal?”</p>
<p>“It was not. He knew that, whichever nation first made alliance with
the Ekumen, the other would follow soon: as it will: as Sith and
Perunter and the Archipelago will also follow, until you find unity. He
loved his country very dearly, sir, but he did not serve it, or you. He
served the master I serve.”</p>
<p>“The Ekumen?” said Argaven, startled. “No. Mankind.”</p>
<p>As I spoke I did not know if what I said was true. True in part; an
aspect of the truth. It would be no less true to say that Estraven’s
acts had risen out of pure personal loyalty, a sense of responsibility
and friendship towards one single human being, myself. Nor would that be
the whole truth.</p>
<p>The king made no reply. His somber, pouched, furrowed face was turned
again to the fire.</p>
<p>“Why did you call to this ship of yours before you notified me of
your return to Karhide?”</p>
<p>“To force your hand, sir. A message to you would also have reached
Lord Tibe, who might have handed me over to the Orgota. Or had me shot.
As he had my friend shot.”</p>
<p>The king said nothing.</p>
<p>“My own survival doesn’t matter all that much, but I have and had
then a duty towards Gethen and the Ekumen, a task to fulfill. I signaled
the ship first, toensure myself some chance of fulfilling it. That was
Estraven’s counsel, and it was right.”</p>
<p>“Well, it was not wrong. At any rate they’ll land here; we shall be
the first. . . . And they’re all like you, eh? All perverts, always in
kemmer? A queer lot to vie for the honor of receiving. . . . Tell Lord
Gorchern, the chamberlain, how they expect to be received. See to it
that there’s no offense or omission. They’ll be lodged in the Palace,
wherever you think suitable. I wish to show them honor. You’ve done me a
couple of good turns, Mr. Ai. Made liars of the Commensals, and then
fools.”</p>
<p>“And presently allies, my lord.”</p>
<p>“I know!” he said shrilly. “But Karhide first - Karhide first!”</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>After some silence, he said, “How was it, that pull across the
Ice?”</p>
<p>“Not easy.”</p>
<p>“Estraven would be a good man to pull with, on a crazy trek like
that. He was tough as iron. And never lost his temper. I’m sorry he’s
dead.”</p>
<p>I found no reply.</p>
<p>“I’ll receive your . . . countrymen in audience tomorrow afternoon at
Second Hour. Is there more needs saying now?”</p>
<p>“My lord, will you revoke the Order of Exile on Estraven, to clear
his name?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, Mr. Ai. Don’t rush it. Anything more?”</p>
<p>“No more.”</p>
<p>“Go on, then.”</p>
<p>Even I betrayed him. I had said I would not bring the ship down till
his banishment was ended, his name cleared. I could not throw away what
he had died for, by insisting on the condition. It would not bring him
out of this exile.</p>
<p>The rest of that day went in arranging with Lord Gorchern and others
for the reception and lodging of the ship’s company. At Second Hour we
set out by powersledge to Athten Fen, about thirty miles northeast of
Erhenrang. The landing site was at the near edge of the great desolate
region, a peat-marsh too boggy to be farmed or settled, and now in
mid-Irrem a flat frozen waste many feet deep in snow. The radio beacon
had been functioning all day, and they had received confirmation signals
from the ship.</p>
<p>On the screens, coming in, the crew must have seen the terminator
lying clear across the Great Continent along the border, from Guthen Bay
to the Gulf of Charisune, and the peaks of the Kargav still in sunlight,
a chain of stars; for it was twilight when we, looking up, saw the one
star descending.</p>
<p>She came down in a roar and glory, and steam went roaring up white as
her stabilizers went down in the great lake of water and mud created by
the retro; down underneath the bog there was permafrost like granite,
and she came to rest balanced neatly, and sat cooling over the quickly
refreezing lake, a great, delicate fish balanced on its tail, dark
silver in the twilight of Winter.</p>
<p>Beside me Faxe of Otherhord spoke for the first time since the sound
and splendor of the ship’s descent. “I’m glad I have lived to see this,”
he said. So Estraven had said when he looked at the Ice, at death; so he
should have said this night. To get away from the bitter regret that
beset me I started to walk forward over the snow towards the ship. She
was frosted already by the interhull coolants, and as I approached the
high port slid open and the exit-way was extruded, a graceful curve down
onto the ice. The first off was Lang Heo Hew, unchanged, of course,
precisely as I had last seen her, three years ago in my life and a
couple of weeks inhers. She looked at me, and at Faxe, and at the others
of the escort who had followed me, and stopped at the foot of the ramp.
She said solemnly in Karhidish, “I have come in friendship.” To her eyes
we were all aliens. I let Faxe greet her first.</p>
<p>He indicated me to her, and she came and took my right hand in the
fashion of my people, looking into my face. “Oh Genly,” she said, “I
didn’t know you!” It was strange to hear a woman’s voice, after so long.
The others came out of the ship, on my advice: evidence of any mistrust
at this point would humiliate the Karhidish escort, impugning their
shifgrethor. Out they came, and met the Karhiders with a beautiful
courtesy. But they all looked strange to me, men and women, well as I
knew them. Their voices sounded strange: too deep, too shrill. They were
like a troupe of great, strange animals, of two different species: great
apes with intelligent eyes, all of them in rut, in kemmer. . . . They
took my hand, touched me, held me.</p>
<p>I managed to keep myself in control, and to tell Heo Hew and Tulier
what they most urgently needed to know about the situation they had
entered, during the sledge-ride back to Erhenrang. When we got to the
Palace, however, I had to get to my room at once.</p>
<p>The physician from Sassinoth came in. His quiet voice and his face, a
young, serious face, not a man’s face and not a woman’s, a human face,
these were a relief to me, familiar, right. . . . But he said, after
ordering me to get to bed and dosing me with some mild tranquilizer,
“I’ve seen your fellow-Envoys. This is a marvelous thing, the coming of
men from the stars. And in my lifetime!”</p>
<p>There again was the delight, the courage, that is most admirable in
the Karhidish spirit-and in the human spirit-and though I could not
share it with him, to deny it would be a detestable act. I said, without
sincerity, but with absolute truth, “It is a marvelous thing indeed for
them as well, the coming to a new world, a new mankind.”</p>
<p>At the end of that spring, late in Tuwa when the Thaw-floods were
going down and travel was possible again, I took a vacation from my
little Embassy in Erhenrang, and went east. My people were spread out by
now all over the planet. Since we had been authorized to use the
aircars, Heo Hew and three others had taken one and flown over to Sith
and the Archipelago, nations of the Sea Hemisphere which I had entirely
neglected. Others were in Orgoreyn, and two, reluctant, in Perun-ter,
where the Thaws do not even begin until Tuwa and everything refreezes
(they say) a week later. Tulier and Ke’sta were getting on very well in
Erhenrang, and could handle what might come up. Nothing was urgent.
After all, a ship setting out at once from the closest of Winter’s new
allies could not arrive before seventeen years, planetary time, had
passed. It is a marginal world, on the edge. Out beyond it towards the
South Orion Arm no world has been found where men live. And it is a long
way back from Winter to the prime worlds of the Ekumen, the
hearth-worlds of our race: fifty years to Hain-Davenant, a man’s
lifetime to Earth. No hurry.</p>
<p>I crossed the Kargav, this time on lower passes, on a road that winds
along above the coast of the southern sea. I paid a visit to the first
village I had stayed in, when the fishermen brought me in from Horden
Island three years ago; the folk of that Hearth received me, now as
then, without the least surprise. I spent a week in the big port city
Thather at the mouth of the River Ench, and then in early summer started
on foot into Kerm Land.</p>
<p>I walked east and south into the steep harsh country full of crags
and green hills and great rivers and lonely houses, till I came to
Icefoot Lake. From the lakeshore looking up southward at the hills I saw
a light I knew: the blink, the white suffusion of the sky, the glare of
the glacier lying high beyond. The Ice was there.</p>
<p>Estre was a very old place. Its Hearth and outbuildings were all of
gray stone cut from the steep mountainside to which it clung. It was
bleak, full of the sound of wind.</p>
<p>I knocked and the door was opened. I said, “I ask the hospitality of
the Domain. I was a friend of Therem of Estre.”</p>
<p>The one who opened to me, a slight, grave-looking “fellow of nineteen
or twenty, accepted my words in silence and silently admitted me to the
Hearth. He took me to the wash-house, the tiring-rooms, the great
kitchen, and when he had seen to it that the stranger was clean,
clothed, and fed, he left me to myself in a bedroom that looked down out
of deep slit-windows over the gray lake and the gray thore-forests that
lie between Estre and Stok. It was a bleak land, a bleak house. Fire
roared in the deep hearth, giving as always more warmth for the eye and
spirit than for the flesh, for the stone floor and walls, the wind
outside blowing down off the mountains and the Ice, drank up most of the
heat of the flames. But I did not feel the cold as I used to, my first
two years on Winter; I had lived long in a cold land, now.</p>
<p>In an hour or so the boy (he had a girl’s quick delicacy in his looks
and movements, but no girl could keep so grim a silence as he did) came
to tell me that the Lord of Estre would receive me if it pleased me to
come. I followed him downstairs, through long corridors where some kind
of game of hide-and-seek was going on. Children shot by us, darted
around us, little ones shrieking with excitement, adolescents slipping
like shadows from door to door, hands over their mouths to keep laughter
still. One fat little thing of five or six caromed into my legs, then
plunged and grabbed my escort’s hand for protection. “Sorve!” he
squeaked, staring up wide-eyed at me all the time, “Sorve, I’m going to
hide in the brewery-!” Off he went like a round pebble from a sling. The
young man Sorve, not at all discomposed, led me on and brought me into
the Inner Hearth to the Lord of Estre.</p>
<p>Esvans Harth rem ir Estraven was an old man, past seventy, crippled
by an arthritic disease of the hips. He sat erect in a rolling-chair by
the fire. His face was broad, much blunted and worn down by time, like a
rock in a torrent: a calm face, terribly calm.</p>
<p>“You are the Envoy, Genry Ai?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>He looked at me, and I at him. Therein had been the son, child of the
flesh, of this old lord. Therein the younger son; Arek the elder, that
brother whose voice he had heard in mine bespeaking him; both dead now.
I could not see anything of my friend in that worn, calm, hard old face
that met my gaze. I found nothing there but the certainty, the sure fact
of Therem’s death.</p>
<p>I had come on a fool’s errand to Estre, hoping for solace. There was
no solace; and why should a pilgrimage to the place of my friend’s
childhood make any difference, fill any absence, soothe any remorse?
Nothing could be changed now. My coming to Estre had, however, another
purpose, and this I could accomplish.</p>
<p>“I was with your son in the months before his death. I was with him
when he died. I’ve brought you the journals he kept. And if there’s
anything I can tell you of those days-”</p>
<p>No particular expression showed on the old man’s face. That calmness
was not to be altered. But the young one with a sudden movement came out
of the shadows into the light between the window and the fire, a bleak
uneasy light, and he spoke harshly: “In Erhenrang they still call him
Estraven the Traitor.”</p>
<p>The old lord looked at the boy, then at me.</p>
<p>“This is Sorve Harth,” he said, “heir of Estre, my sons’ son.”</p>
<p>There is no ban on incest there, I knew it well enough. Only the
strangeness of it, to me a Terran, and the strangeness of seeing the
flash of my friend’s spirit in this grim, fierce, provincial boy, made
me dumb for a while. When I spoke my voice was unsteady. “The king will
recant. Therem was no traitor. What does it matter what fools call
him?”</p>
<p>The old lord nodded slowly, smoothly. “It matters,” he said.</p>
<p>“You crossed the Gobrin Ice together,” Sorve demanded, “you and
he?”</p>
<p>“We did.”</p>
<p>“I should like to hear that tale, my Lord Envoy,” said old Esvans,
very calm. But the boy, Therem’s son, said stammering, “Will you tell
.us how he died? -Will you tell us about the other worlds out among the
stars- the other kinds of men, the other lives?”</p>
<p>The Gethenian Calendar and Clock</p>
<p>The Year. Gethen’s period of revolution is 8401 Terran Standard
Hours, or .96 of the Terran Standard Year.</p>
<p>The period of rotation is 23.08 Terran Standard Hours: the Gethenian
year contains 364 days.</p>
<p>In Karhide/Orgoreyn years are not numbered consecutively from a base
year forward to the present; the base year is the current year. Every
New Years Day (Getheny Them) the year just past becomes the year
“one-ago,” and every past date is increased by one. The future is
similarly counted, next year being the year “one-to-come,” until it in
turn becomes the Year One.</p>
<p>The inconvenience of this system in record-keeping is palliated by
various devices, for instance reference to well-known events, reigns of
kings, dynasties, local lords, etc. The Yomeshta count in 144-year
cycles from the Birth of Meshe (2202 years-ago, in Ekumenical Year
1492), and keep ritual celebrations every twelfth year; but this system
is strictly cultic and is not officially employed even by the government
of Orgoreyn, which sponsors the Yomesh religion.</p>
<p>The Month. The period of revolution of Gethen’s moon is 26 Gethenian
days; the rotation is captured, so that the moon presents the same face
to the planet always.</p>
<p>There are 14 months in the year, and as solar and lunar calendars
concur so closely that adjustment is required only about once in 200
years, the days of the month are invariable, as are the dates of
the-phases of the moon. The Karhidish names of the months:</p>
<p>Winter:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Them</p></li>
<li><p>Thanern</p></li>
<li><p>Nimmer</p></li>
<li><p>Anner</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Spring:</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>Irrem</p></li>
<li><p>Moth</p></li>
<li><p>Tuwa</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Summer:</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>Osme</p></li>
<li><p>Ockre</p></li>
<li><p>Kus</p></li>
<li><p>Hakanna</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Autumn:</p>
<ol start="12" type="1">
<li><p>Gor</p></li>
<li><p>Susmy</p></li>
<li><p>Grende</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The 26-day month is divided into two halfmonths of 13 days.</p>
<p>The Day. The day (23.08 T.S.H.) is divided into 10 hours (see below);
being invariable, the days of the month are generally referred to by
name, like our days of the week, not by number. (Many of the names refer
to the phase of the moon,e.g. Getheny, “darkness,” Arhad, “first
crescent,” etc. The prefix-od used in the second halfmonth is a
reversive, giving a contrary meaning, so that Odgetheny might be
translated as “undarkness.”) The Karhidish names of the days of the
month:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Getheny</p></li>
<li><p>Sordny</p></li>
<li><p>Eps</p></li>
<li><p>Arhad</p></li>
<li><p>Netherhad</p></li>
<li><p>Streth</p></li>
<li><p>Berny</p></li>
<li><p>Orny</p></li>
<li><p>Harhahad</p></li>
<li><p>Guyrny</p></li>
<li><p>Yrny</p></li>
<li><p>Posthe</p></li>
<li><p>Tormenbod</p></li>
<li><p>Odgetheny</p></li>
<li><p>Odsordny</p></li>
<li><p>Odeps</p></li>
<li><p>Odarhad</p></li>
<li><p>Onnetherhad</p></li>
<li><p>Odstreth</p></li>
<li><p>Obberny</p></li>
<li><p>Odorny</p></li>
<li><p>Odharhahad</p></li>
<li><p>Odguyrny</p></li>
<li><p>Odyrny</p></li>
<li><p>Opposthe</p></li>
<li><p>Ottormenbod</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Hour. The decimal clock used in all Gethenian cultures converts
as follows, very roughly, to the Ter-ran double-twelve-hour clock (Note:
This is a mere guide to the time of day implied by a Gethenian “Hour”;
the complexities of an exact conversion, given the fact that the
Gethenian day contains only 23.08 Terran Standard Hours, are irrelevant
to my purpose):</p>
<p>First Hour - noon to 2:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Second Hour - 2:30 to 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Third Hour - 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Fourth Hour - 7:00 to 9:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Fifth Hour - 9:30 to midnight</p>
<p>Sixth Hour - midnight to 2:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Seventh Hour - 2:30 to 5:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Eighth Hour - 5:00 to 7:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Ninth Hour - 7:00 to 9:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Tenth Hour - 9:30 to noon</p>
