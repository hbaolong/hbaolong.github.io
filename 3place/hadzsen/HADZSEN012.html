<h4 id="soliloquies-in-mishnory">11. Soliloquies in Mishnory</h4>
<p>Mishnory. Streth Susmy. I am not hopeful, yet all events show cause
for hope. Obsle haggles and dickers with his fellow Commensals, Yegey
employs blandishments, Slose proselytizes, and the strength of their
following grows. They are astute men, and have their faction well in
hand. Only seven of the Thirty-Three are reliable Open Traders; of the
rest, Obsle thinks to gain the sure support of ten, giving a bare
majority.</p>
<p>One of them seems to have a true interest in the Envoy: Csl. Ithepen
of the Eynyen District, who has been curious about the Alien Mission
since, while working for the Sarf, he was in charge of censoring the
broadcasts we sent out from Erhenrang. He seems to carry the weight of
those suppressions on his conscience. He proposed to Obsle that the
Thirty-Three announce their invitation to the Star Ship not only to
their countrymen, but at the same time to Karhide, asking Argaven to
join Karhide’s voice to the invitation. A noble plan, and it will not be
followed. They will not ask Karhide to join them in anything.</p>
<p>The Sarf s men among the Thirty-Three of course oppose any
consideration at all of the Envoy’s presence and mission. As for those
lukewarm and uncommitted whom Obsle hopes to enlist, I think they fear
the Envoy, much as Argaven and most of the Court did; with this
difference, that Argaven thought him mad, like himself, while they think
him a liar, like themselves. They fear to swallow a great hoax in
public, a hoax already refused by Karhide, a hoax perhaps even invented
by Karhide. They make their invitation, they make it publicly; then
where is their shifgrethor, when no Star Ship comes?</p>
<p>Indeed Genly Ai demands of us an inordinate trustfulness.</p>
<p>To him evidently it is not inordinate.</p>
<p>And Obsle and Yegey think that a majority of the Thirty-Three will be
persuaded to trust him. I do not know why I am less hopeful than they;
perhaps I do not really want Orgoreyn to prove more enlightened than
Karhide, to take the risk and win the praise and leave Karhide in the
shadow. If this envy be patriotic, it comes too late; as soon as I saw
that Tibe would soon have me ousted, I did all I could to ensure that
the Envoy would come to Orgoreyn, and in exile here I have done what I
could to win them to him.</p>
<p>Thanks to the money he brought me from Ashe I now live by myself
again, as a “unit” not a “dependent.” I go to no more banquets, am not
seen in public with Obsle or other supporters of the Envoy, and have not
seen the Envoy himself for over a halfmonth, since his second day in
Mishnory.</p>
<p>He gave me Ashe’s money as one would give a hired assassin his fee. I
have not often been so angry, and I insulted him deliberately. He knew I
was angry but I am not sure he understood that he was insulted; he
seemed to accept my advice despite the manner of its giving; and when my
temper cooled I saw this, and was worried by it. Is it possible that all
along in Erhenrang he was seeking my advice, not knowing how to tell me
that he sought it? If so, then he must have misunderstood half and not
understood the rest of what I told him by my fireside in the Palace, the
night after the Ceremony of the Keystone. His shifgrethor must be
founded, and composed, and sustained, altogether differently from ours;
and when I thought myself most blunt and frank with him he may have
found me most subtle and unclear.</p>
<p>His obtuseness is ignorance. His arrogance is ignorance. He is
ignorant of us: we of him. He is infinitely a stranger, and I a fool, to
let my shadow cross the light of the hope he brings us. I keep my mortal
vanity down. I keep out of his way: for clearly that is what he wants.
He is right. An exiled Karhidish traitor is no credit to his cause.</p>
<p>Conformable to the Orgota law that each “unit” must have employment,
I work from Eighth Hour to noon in a plastics factory. Easy work: I run
a machine which fits together and heat bonds pieces of plastic to form
little transparent boxes. I do not know what the boxes are for. In the
afternoon, finding myself dull, I have taken up the old disciplines I
learned in Rotherer. I am glad to see I have lost no skill at summoning
dothe-strength, or entering the untrance; but I get little good out of
the untrance, and as for the skills of stillness and of fasting, I might
as well never have learned them, and must start all over, like a child.
I have fasted now one day, and my belly screams A week! A month!</p>
<p>The nights freeze now; tonight a hard wind bears frozen rain. All
evening I have thought continually of Estre and the sound of the wind
seems the sound of the wind that blows there. I wrote to my son tonight,
a long letter. While writing it I had again and again a sense of Arek’s
presence, as if I should see him if I turned. Why do I keep such notes
as these? For my son to read? Little good they would do him. I write to
be writing in my own language, perhaps.</p>
<p>Harhahad Susmy. Still no mention of the Envoy has been made on the
radio, not a word. I wonder if Genly Ai sees that in Orgoreyn, despite
the vast visible apparatus of government, nothing is done visibly,
nothing is said aloud. The machine conceals the machinations.</p>
<p>Tibe wants to teach Karhide how to lie. He takes his lessons from
Orgoreyn: a good school. But I think we shall have trouble learning how
to lie, having for so long practiced the art of going round and round
the truth without ever lying about it, or reaching it either.</p>
<p>A big Orgota foray yesterday across the Ey; they burned the granaries
of Tekember. Precisely what the Sarf wants, and what Tibe wants. But
where does it end?</p>
<p>Slose, having turned his Yomesh mysticism onto the Envoy’s
statements, interprets the coming of the Ekumen to earth as the coming
of the Reign of Meshe among men, and loses sight of our purpose. “We
must halt this rivalry with Karhide before the New Men come,” he says.
“We must cleanse our spirits for their coming. We must forego
shifgrethor, forbid all acts of vengeance, and unite together without
envy as brothers of one Hearth.”</p>
<p>But how, until they come? How to break the circle?</p>
<p>Guyrny Susmy. Slose heads a committee that purposes to suppress the
obscene plays performed in public kemmerhouses here; they must be like
the Karhidishhuhuth. Slose opposes them because they are trivial,
vulgar, and blasphemous.</p>
<p>To oppose something is to maintain it.</p>
<p>They say here “all roads lead to Mishnory.” To be sure, if you turn
your back on Mishnory and walk away from it, you are still on the
Mishnory road. To oppose vulgarity is inevitably to be vulgar. You must
go somewhere else; you must have another goal; then you walk a different
road.</p>
<p>Yegey in the Hall of the Thirty-Three today: “I unalterably oppose
this blockade of grain-exports to Kar-hide, and the spirit of
competition which motivates it.” Right enough, but he will not get off
the Mishnory road going that way. He must offer an alternative. Orgoreyn
and Karhide both must stop following the road they’re on, in either
direction; they must go somewhere else, and break the circle. Yegey, I
think, should be talking of the Envoy and of nothing else.</p>
<p>To be an atheist is to maintain God. His existence or his
nonexistence, it amounts to much the same, on the plane of proof. Thus
proof is a word not often used among the Handdarata, who have chosen not
to treat God as a fact, subject either to proof or to belief: and they
have broken the circle, and go free.</p>
<p>To learn which questions are unanswerable, and not to answer them:
this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness.</p>
<p>Tormenbod Susmy. My unease grows: still not one word about the Envoy
has been spoken on the Central Bureau Radio. None of the news about him
that we used to broadcast from Erhenrang was ever released here, and
rumors rising out of illegal radio reception over the border, and
traders’ and travelers’ stories, never seem to have spread far. The Sarf
has more complete control over communications than I knew, or thought
possible. The possibility is awesome. In Karhide king and kyorremy have
a good deal of control over what people do, but very little over what
they hear, and none over what they say. Here, the government can check
not only act but thought. Surely no men should have such power over
others.</p>
<p>Shusgis and others take Genly Ai about the city openly. I wonder if
he sees that this openness hides the fact that he is hidden. No one
knows he is here. I ask my fellow-workers at the factory, they know
nothing and think I am talking of some crazy Yomesh sectarian. No
information, no interest, nothing that might advance Ai’s cause, or
protect his life.</p>
<p>It is a pity he looks so like us. In Erhenrang people often pointed
him out on the street, for they knew some truth or talk about him and
knew he was there. Here where his presence is kept secret his person
goes unremarked. They see him no doubt much as I first saw him: an
unusually tall, husky, and dark youth just entering kemmer. I studied
the physicians’ reports on him last year. His differences from us are
profound. They are not superficial. One must know him to know him
alien.</p>
<p>Why do they hide him, then? Why does not one of the Commensals force
the issue and speak of him in a public speech or on the radio? Why is
even Obsle silent? Out of fear.</p>
<p>My king was afraid of the Envoy; these fellows are afraid of one
another.</p>
<p>I think that I, a foreigner, am the only person Obsle trusts. He has
some pleasure in my company (as I in his), and several times has waived
shifgrethor and frankly asked my advice. But when I urge him to speak
out, to raise public interest as a defense against factional intrigue,
he does not hear me.</p>
<p>“If the entire Commensality had their eyes on the Envoy, the Sarf
would not dare touch him,” I say, “or you, Obsle.”</p>
<p>Obsle sighs. “Yes, yes, but we can’t do it, Estraven. Radio, printed
bulletins, scientific periodicals, they’re all in the Sarf s hands. What
am I to do, make speeches on a street-corner like some fanatic
priest?”</p>
<p>“Well, one can talk to people, set rumors going; I had to do
something of the same sort last year in Erhen-rang. Get people asking
questions to which you have the answer, that is, the Envoy himself.”</p>
<p>“If only he’d bring that damned Ship of his down here, so that we had
something to show people! But as it is-”</p>
<p>“He won’t bring his Ship down until he knows that you’re acting in
good faith.”</p>
<p>“Am I not?” cries Obsle, fattening out like a great hob-fish-
“Haven’t I spent every hour of the past month on this business? Good
faith! He expects us to believe whatever he tells us, and then doesn’t
trust us in return!”</p>
<p>“Should he?”</p>
<p>Obsle puffs and does not reply.</p>
<p>He comes nearer honesty than any Orgota government official I
know.</p>
<p>Odgetheny Susmy. To become a high officer in the Sarf one must have,
it seems, a certain complex form of stupidity. Gaum exemplifies it. He
sees me as a Karhidish agent attempting to lead Orgoreyn into a
tremendous prestige-loss by persuading them to believe in the hoax of
the Envoy from the Ekumen; he thinks that I spent my time as Prime
Minister preparing this hoax. By God, I have better things to do than
play Shifgrethor with scum. But that is a simplicity he is unequipped to
see. Now that Yegey has apparently cast me off Gaum thinks I must be
purchasable, and so prepared to buy me out in his own curious fashion.
He has watched me or had me watched close enough that he knew I would be
due to enter kemmer on Posthe or Tormenbod; so he turned up last night
in full kemmer, hormone-induced no doubt, ready to seduce me. An
accidental meeting on Pyenefen Street. “Harth! I haven’t seen you ina
halfmonth, where have you been hiding yourself lately? Come have a cup
of ale with me.”</p>
<p>He chose an alehouse next door to one of the Commensal Public Kemmer
houses. He ordered us not ale, but lifewater. He meant to waste no time.
After one glass he put his hand on mine and shoved his face up close,
whispering, “We didn’t meet by chance, I waited for you: I crave you for
my kemmering tonight,” and he called me by my given name. I did not cut
his tongue out, because since I left Estre I don’t carry a knife. I told
him that I intended to abstain while in exile. He cooed and muttered and
held on to my hands. He was going very rapidly into full phase as a
woman. Gaum is very beautiful in kemmer, and he counted on his beauty
and his sexual insistence, knowing, I suppose, that being of the
Handdara I would be unlikely to use kemmer-reduction drugs, and would
make a point of abstinence against the odds. He forgot that detestation
is as good as any drug. I got free of his pawing, which of course was
having some effect on me, and left him, suggesting that he try the
public kemmerhouse next door. At that he looked at me with pitiable
hatred: for he was, however false his .purpose, truly in kemmer and
deeply roused.</p>
<p>Did he really think I’d sell myself for his small change? He must
think me very uneasy; which, indeed, makes me uneasy.</p>
<p>Damn them, these unclean men. There is not one clean man among
them.</p>
<p>Odsordny Susmy. This afternoon Genly Ai spoke in the Hall of the
Thirty-Three. No audience was permitted and no broadcast made, but Obsle
later had me in and played me his own tape of the session. The Envoy
spoke well, with moving candor and urgency. There is an innocence in him
that I have found merely foreign and foolish; yet in another moment that
seeming innocence reveals a discipline of knowledge and a largeness of
purpose that awes me. Through him speaks a shrewd, and magnanimous
people, a people who have woven together into one wisdom a profound,
old, terrible, and unimaginably various experience of life. But he
himself is young: impatient, inexperienced. He stands higher than we
stand, seeing wider, but he is himself only the height of a man.</p>
<p>He speaks better now than he did in Erhenrang, more simply and more
subtly; he has learned his job in doing it, like us all.</p>
<p>His speech was often interrupted by members of the Domination faction
demanding that the President stop this lunatic, turn him out, and get on
with the order of business. Csl. Yemenbey was most obstreperous, and
probably spontaneous. “You don’t swallow thisgichy-michyp” he kept
roaring across to Obsle. Planned interruptions which made part of the
tape hard to follow were led, Obsle says, by Kaharosile. -From
memory:</p>
<p>Alshel (presiding): Mr. Envoy, we find this information, and the
proposals made by Mr. Obsle, Mr. Slose, Mr. Ithepen, Mr. Yegey and
others, most interesting-most stimulating. We need, however, a little
more to go on. (Laughter) Since the King of Karhide has your . . . the
vehicle you arrived on, locked up where we can’t see it, would it be
possible, as suggested, for you to bring down your . . . Star Ship? What
do you call it?</p>
<p>Ai: Starship is a good name, sir.</p>
<p>Alshel: Oh? What do you call it?</p>
<p>Ai: Well, technically, it’s a manned interstellar Cetian Design
NAFAL-20.</p>
<p>Voice: You’re sure it’s not St. Pethethe’s sledge? (Laughter)</p>
<p>Alshel: Please. Yes. Well, if you can get this ship down onto the
ground here-solid ground you might say-so that we can, as it were, have
some substantial-Voice: Substantial fishguts!</p>
<p>Ai: I want very much to bring that ship down, Mr. Alshel, as proof
and witness of our reciprocal good faith. I await only your preliminary
public announcement of the event.</p>
<p>Kaharosile: Don’t you see, Commensals, what all this is? It’s not
just a stupid joke. It is, in intention, a public mockery of our
credulity, our gullibility, our stupidity-engineered, with incredible
impudence, by this person who stands here before us today. You know he
comes from Karhide. You know he is a Karhidish agent. You can see he is
a sexual deviant of a type which in Karhide, due to the influence of the
Dark Cult, is left un-cured, and sometimes is even artificially created
for the Foretellers’ orgies. And yet when he says “I am from outer
space” some of you actually shut your eyes, abase your intellects, and
believe! Never could I have thought it possible, etc., etc.</p>
<p>To judge by the tape, Ai withstood gibes and assaults with patience.
Obsle says he handled himself well. I was hanging about outside the Hall
to see them come out after the Session of the Thirty-Three. Ai had a
grim pondering look. Well he might.</p>
<p>My helplessness is intolerable. I was one who set this machine
running, and now cannot control its running. I slink in the streets with
my hood pulled forward, to catch a glimpse of the Envoy. For this
useless sneaking life I threw away my power, my money, and my friends.
What a fool you are, Therem.</p>
<p>Why can I never set my heart on a possible thing?</p>
<p>Odeps Susmy. The transmitting device Genly Ai has now turned over to
the Thirty-Three, in Obsle’s care, is not going to change any minds. No
doubt it does what he says it does, but if Royal Mathematician Shorst
would say of it only, “I don’t understand the principles,” then no
Orgota mathematician or engineer will do much better, and nothing is
proved or disproved. An admirable outcome, were this world one Fastness
of the Handdara, but alas we must walk forward troubling the new snow,
proving and disproving, asking and answering.</p>
<p>Once more I pressed on Obsle the feasibility of having Ai radio his
Star Ship, waken the people aboard, and ask them to converse with the
Commensals by radio hook-up to the Hall of the Thirty-Three. This time
Obsle had a reason ready for not doing so. “Listen, Estraven my dear,
the Sarf runs all our radio, you know that by now. I have no idea, even
I, which of the men in Communications are the Sarf men; most of them, no
doubt, for I know as a fact that they run the transmitters and receivers
on every level right down to the technicians and repairmen. They could
and would block-or falsify -any transmission we received, if we did
receive one! Can you imagine that scene, in the Hall? We ‘Outer-spacers’
victims of our own hoax, listening with bated breath to a clutter of
static-and nothing else-no answer, no Message?”</p>
<p>“And you have no money to hire some loyal technicians, or buy off
some of theirs?” I asked; but no use. He fears for his own prestige. His
behavior towards me is already changed. If he calls off his reception
for the Envoy tonight, things are in a bad way.</p>
<p>Odarhad Susmy. He called off the reception.</p>
<p>This morning I went to see the Envoy, in proper Orgota style. Not
openly, at Shusgis’ house, where the staff must be crawling with Sarf
agents, Shusgis being one himself, but in the street, by chance,
Gaum-fashion, sneaking and creeping. “Mr. Ai, will you hear me a
moment?”</p>
<p>He looked around startled, and recognizing me, alarmed. After a
moment he broke out, “What good is it, Mr. Harth? You know that I can’t
rely on what you say-since Erhenrang-”</p>
<p>That was candid, if not perceptive; yet it was perceptive too: he
knew that I wanted to advise him, not to ask something of him, and spoke
to save my pride.</p>
<p>I said, “This is Mishnory, not Erhenrang, but the danger you are in
is the same. If you cannot persuade Obsle or Yegey to let you make radio
contact with your ship, so that the people aboard it can while remaining
safe lend some support to your statements, then I think you should use
your own instrument, the ansible, and call the ship down at once. The
risk it will run is less than the risk you are now running, alone.”</p>
<p>“The Commensals’ debates concerning my messages have been kept
secret. How do you know about my ‘statements,’ Mr. Harth?”</p>
<p>“Because I have made it my life’s business to know-”</p>
<p>“But it is not your business here, sir. It is up to the Commensals of
Orgoreyn.”</p>
<p>“I tell you that you’re in danger of your life, Mr. Ai,” I said; to
that he said nothing, and I left him.</p>
<p>I should have spoken to him days ago. It is too late. Fear undoes his
mission and my hope, once more. Not fear of the alien, the unearthly,
not here. These Orgota have not the wits nor size of spirit to fear what
is truly and immensely strange. They cannot even see it. They look at
the man from another world and see what? a spy from Karhide, a pervert,
an agent, a sorry little political Unit like themselves.</p>
<p>If he does not send for the ship at once it will be too late; it may
be already too late. It is my fault. I have done nothing right.</p>
