<h3 id="integrity-in-leadership">Integrity in Leadership</h3>
<p>The spirit of an organization is created from the top.</p>
<p>The proof of the sincerity and seriousness of a management is
uncom-</p>
<p>promising emphasis on integrity of character. This, above all, has to
be</p>
<p>symbolized in management’s “people” decisions. For it is character
through</p>
<p>which leadership is exercised; it is character that sets the example
and is</p>
<p>imitated. Character is not something one can fool people about. The
people</p>
<p>with whom a person works, and especially subordinates, know in a
few</p>
<p>weeks whether he or she has integrity or not. They may forgive a
person for a</p>
<p>great deal: incompetence, ignorance, insecurity, or bad manners. But
they will</p>
<p>not forgive a lack of integrity in that person. Nor will they
forgive</p>
<p>higher management for choosing him.</p>
<p>This is particularly true of the people at the head of an enterprise.
For</p>
<p>the spirit of an organization is created from the top. If an
organization is</p>
<p>great in spirit, it is because the spirit of its top people is great.
If it decays,</p>
<p>it does so because the top rots; as the proverb has it, “Trees die
from the</p>
<p>top.” No one should ever be appointed to a senior position unless
top</p>
<p>manage-ment is willing to have his or her character serve as the
model for</p>
<p>subordi-nates.</p>

<h3 id="identifying-the-future">Identifying the Future</h3>
<p>The important thing is to identify the “future that has already
happened.”</p>
<p>Futurists always measure their batting average by counting how
many</p>
<p>things they have predicted that have come true. They never count how
many</p>
<p>important things come true that they did not predict. Everything a
forecaster</p>
<p>predicts may come to pass. Yet, he may not have seen the most
meaningful of</p>
<p>the emergent realities or, worse still, may not have paid at-tention
to them.</p>
<p>There is no way to avoid this irrelevancy in forecasting, for the
important and</p>
<p>distinctive are always the result of changes in values, per-</p>
<p>ception, and goals, that is, in things that one can divine but not
forecast.</p>
<p>But the most important work of the executive is to identify the
changes</p>
<p>that have already happened. The important challenge in society,
econom-ics,</p>
<p>politics, is to exploit the changes that have already occurred and to
use them</p>
<p>as opportunities. The important thing is to identify the “future that
has already</p>
<p>happened”—and to develop a methodology for perceiving and
analyzing</p>
<p>these changes. A good deal of this methodology is incorporated in my
1985</p>
<p>book Innovation and Entrepreneurship, which shows how one
systematically</p>
<p>looks to the changes in society, in demographics, in mean-ing, in
science and</p>
<p>technology, as opportunities to make the future.</p>

<h3 id="management-is-indispensable">Management Is Indispensable</h3>
<p>Whoever makes two blades of grass grow where only one grew before</p>
<p>deserves better of mankind than any speculative philosopher or
metaphysical</p>
<p>system builder.</p>
<p>Management will remain a basic and dominant institution perhaps as
long</p>
<p>as Western civilization itself survives. For management is not only
grounded</p>
<p>in the nature of the modern industrial system and in the</p>
<p>needs of modern business enterprise, to which an industrial system
must</p>
<p>entrust its productive resources, both human and material.
Management</p>
<p>also expresses the basic beliefs of modern Western society. It
expresses</p>
<p>the belief in the possibility of controlling man’s livelihood through
the</p>
<p>system-atic organization of economic resources. It expresses the
belief</p>
<p>that eco-nomic change can be made into the most powerful engine
for</p>
<p>human betterment and social justice—that, as Jonathan Swift first</p>
<p>overstated it three hundred years ago, whoever makes two blades of
grass</p>
<p>grow where only one grew before deserves better of mankind than
any</p>
<p>speculative philosopher or metaphysical system builder.</p>
<p>Management—which is the organ of society specifically charged
with</p>
<p>making resources productive, that is, with the responsibility for
organized</p>
<p>economic advance—therefore reflects the basic spirit of the modern
age.</p>
<p>It is, in fact, indispensable, and this explains why, once begotten,
it grew</p>
<p>so fast and with so little opposition.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-2">ACTION POINT:</h3>

<h3 id="organizational-inertia">Organizational Inertia</h3>
<p>All organizations need a discipline that makes them face up to
reality.</p>
<p>All organizations need to know that virtually no program or activity
will</p>
<p>perform effectively for a long time without modification and
redesign.</p>
<p>Eventually every activity becomes obsolete. Among organizations that
ig-</p>
<p>nore this fact, the worst offender is government. Indeed, the
inability to</p>
<p>stop doing anything is the central disease of government and a major
rea-</p>
<p>son why government today is sick. Hospitals and universities are only
a</p>
<p>lit-tle better than government in getting rid of yesterday.</p>
<p>Businessmen are just as sentimental about yesterday as bureaucrats.
They</p>
<p>are just as likely to respond to the failure of a product or program
by doubling</p>
<p>the efforts invested in it. But they are, fortunately, unable to
in-dulge freely in</p>
<p>their predilections. They stand under an objective disci-pline, the
discipline of</p>
<p>the market. They have an objective outside measurement,
profitability. And</p>
<p>so they are forced to slough off the unsuc-cessful and unproductive
sooner or</p>
<p>later. In other organizations—govern-ment, hospitals, the military,
and so on</p>
<p>—economics is only a restraint.</p>
<p>All organizations must be capable of change. We need concepts and</p>
<p>measurements that give to other kinds of organizations what the
market</p>
<p>test and profitability yardstick give to business. Those tests and
yardsticks</p>
<p>will be quite different.</p>

<h3 id="abandonment">Abandonment</h3>
<p>There is nothing as difficult and as expensive, but also nothing as
futile,</p>
<p>as trying to keep a corpse from stinking.</p>
<p>Effective executives know that they have to get many things done
effec-</p>
<p>tively. Therefore, they concentrate. And the first rule for the
concen-tration of</p>
<p>executive efforts is to slough off the past that has ceased to be
productive.</p>
<p>The first-class resources, especially those scarce resources of human
strength,</p>
<p>are immediately pulled out and put to work on the oppor-tunities
of</p>
<p>tomorrow. If leaders are unable to slough off yesterday, to aban-</p>
<p>don yesterday, they simply will not be able to create tomorrow.</p>
<p>Without systematic and purposeful abandonment, an organization will
be</p>
<p>overtaken by events. It will squander its best resources on things it
should</p>
<p>never have been doing or should no longer do. As a result, it will
lack the</p>
<p>resources, especially capable people, needed to exploit the
oppor-tunities that</p>
<p>arise. Far too few businesses are willing to slough off yesterday,
and as a</p>
<p>result, far too few have resources available for tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="practice-of-abandonment">Practice of Abandonment</h3>
<p>If we did not do this already, would we go into it now?</p>
<p>The question has to be asked—and asked seriously—“If we did not do
this</p>
<p>already, would we, knowing what we know, go into it now?” If the</p>
<p>answer is no, the reaction must be “What do we do now?”</p>
<p>In three cases the right action is always outright abandonment.
Aban-</p>
<p>donment is the right action if a product, service, market, or process
“still has a</p>
<p>few years of life.” It is these dying products, services, or
processes that</p>
<p>always demand the greatest care and the greatest efforts. They tie
down the</p>
<p>most productive and ablest people. But equally, a product, service,
market, or</p>
<p>process should be abandoned if the only argument for keeping it is
“It is fully</p>
<p>written off.” For management purposes there are no “cost-less
assets.” There</p>
<p>are only “sunk costs.” The third case where abandonment is the right
policy</p>
<p>—and the most important one—is the one where, for the sake of
maintaining</p>
<p>the old or declining product, service, market, or process the new and
growing</p>
<p>product, service, or process is being stunted or neglected.</p>

<p>Because knowledge workers own their means of production, they are

<p>Manual workers need the job much more than the job needs them. It may
still</p>

<p>Knowledge work requires both autonomy and accountability.</p>
<p>Demanding of knowledge workers that they define their own task and
its</p>
<p>results is necessary because knowledge workers must be au-tonomous.
As</p>
<p>knowledge varies among different people, even in the same field,
each</p>
<p>knowledge worker carries his or her own unique set of knowl-edge.
With this</p>
<p>specialized, unique knowledge, each worker should know more about his
or</p>
<p>her specific area than anyone else in the organization. Indeed,
knowledge</p>
<p>workers must know more about their areas than anyone else; they are
paid to</p>
<p>be knowledgeable in their fields. What this means is that once
each</p>
<p>knowledge worker has defined his or her own task and once the work
has</p>
<p>been appropriately restructured, each worker should be ex-pected to
work out</p>
<p>his or her own course and to take responsibility for it. Knowledge
workers</p>
<p>should be asked to think through their own work plans and then to
submit</p>
<p>them. What am I going to focus on? What results can be expected for

Alternative to Tyranny</h3>
<p>The alternative to autonomous institutions that function and</p>
<p>perform is not freedom. It is totalitarian tyranny.</p>
<p>If the institutions of our pluralist society of institutions do not
perform in</p>
<p>responsible autonomy, we will not have individualism and a society in
which</p>
<p>there is a chance for people to fulfill themselves. We will, instead,
impose on</p>
<p>ourselves complete regimentation in which no one will be al-lowed
autonomy.</p>
<p>We will have Stalinism rather than participatory democ-racy, let
alone the joyful</p>
<p>spontaneity of doing one’s own thing. Tyranny is</p>
<p>the only alternative to strong, performing autonomous institutions.
Tyranny</p>
<p>substitutes one absolute boss for the pluralism of competing in-</p>
<p>stitutions. It substitutes terror for responsibility. It does indeed
do away</p>
<p>with the institutions, but only by submerging all of them in the one
all-</p>
<p>embracing bureaucracy of the apparat. It does produce goods and</p>
<p>services, though only fitfully, wastefully, at a low level, and at

<p>Joseph Schumpeter insisted that innovation is the very essence of
eco-</p>
<p>nomics and most certainly of a modern economy. Schumpeter’s Theory
of</p>
<p>Economic Development makes profit fulfill an economic function. In
the</p>
<p>economy of change and innovation, a profit, in contrast to Karl
Marx’s the-</p>
<p>ory, is not a “surplus value” stolen from the workers. On the
contrary, it is the</p>
<p>only source of jobs for workers and of labor income. The theory of
eco-nomic</p>
<p>development shows that no one except the innovator makes a gen-</p>
<p>uine “profit”; and the innovator’s profit is always quite
short-lived.</p>
<p>But innovation, in Schumpeter’s famous phrase, is also “creative
de-</p>
<p>struction.” It makes obsolete yesterday’s capital equipment and
capital in-</p>
<p>vestment. The more an economy progresses, the more capital
formation</p>
<p>will it therefore need. Thus, what the classical economist—or the</p>

cost,</p>

<p>A hundred years after Bagehot, I was first to identify management as

Mismanagement</h3>
<p>The story of Henry Ford, his rise and decline, and of the revival of
his</p>
<p>company is what one might call a controlled experiment in
mismanagement.</p>
<p>The story of Henry Ford, his rise and decline, and of the revival of
his</p>
<p>company under his grandson, Henry Ford II, has been told many times.
But it</p>
<p>is not commonly realized that this dramatic story is far more than a
story of</p>
<p>personal success and failure. It is, above all, what one might</p>
<p>call a controlled experiment in mismanagement.</p>
<p>The first Ford failed because of his firm conviction that a business
did not</p>
<p>need managers and management. All it needed, he believed, was the
owner-</p>
<p>entrepreneur with his “helpers.” The only difference between Ford and
most</p>
<p>of his business contemporaries, in the U.S. as well as abroad, was
that, as in</p>
<p>everything else he did, Henry Ford stuck uncompromisingly to his</p>
<p>convictions. The way he applied them—for example, by firing or
sidelining</p>
<p>any one of his “helpers,” no matter how able, who dared act as a
“manager,”</p>
<p>make a decision, or take action without orders from Ford—can only
be</p>
<p>described as a test of a hypothesis that ended up by fully disproving
it. In fact,</p>
<p>what makes the Ford story unique—but also important—is that Ford
could</p>
<p>test the hypothesis, in part because he lived so long and in part
because he</p>
<p>had a billion dollars to back his convictions. Ford’s failure was not
the result</p>
<p>of personality or temperament but, first and foremost, the re-sult of
his refusal</p>

other</p>
<p>words, is a practice, rather than a science or profession, although
containing</p>
<p>elements of both. No greater damage could be done to our economy or
to our</p>
<p>society than to attempt to professionalize management by licensing
managers,</p>
<p>for instance, or by limiting access to management positions to people
with a</p>
<p>special academic degree. On the contrary, the test of good management
is</p>
<p>whether it enables the successful performer to do her work. And any
serious</p>
<p>attempt to make management “scientific” or a “profession” is bound to
lead</p>
<p>to the attempt to eliminate those “disturbing nuisances,” the
unpredictabilities</p>
<p>of business life—its risks, its ups and downs, its “wasteful
competition,” the</p>
<p>“irrational choices” of the con-sumer—and in the process, the

<p>What matters is the productivity of nonmanual workers.</p>
<p>In 1881, an American, Frederick Winslow Taylor (1856–1915), first
ap-plied</p>
<p>knowledge to the study of work, the analysis of work, and the
engi-neering of</p>
<p>work. This led to the productivity revolution. The Productivity
Revolution has</p>
<p>become a victim of its own success. From now on, what matters is
the</p>
<p>productivity of nonmanual workers. And that requires apply-</p>
<p>ing knowledge to knowledge.</p>
<p>But knowledge is now also being applied systematically and
purpose-</p>
<p>fully to define what new knowledge is needed, whether it is feasible,
and</p>
<p>what has to be done to make knowledge effective. It is being applied,
in</p>
<p>other words, to systematic innovation. This third change in the
dynamics</p>
<p>of knowledge can be called the Management Revolution. Supplying</p>

<p>Economically, the decline in the younger population will change

<p>balance rapid change and continuity. One way is to make part-nership
in</p>
<p>change the basis of continuing relationships. Balancing change and
continuity</p>
<p>requires continuous work on information. Nothing disrupts continuity
and</p>
<p>corrupts relationships more than poor or unreliable infor-mation. It
has to</p>
<p>become routine for any enterprise to ask at any change, even the most

<p>in the community. Yet the organization cannot submerge itself in
the</p>
<p>community or subordinate itself to that community. Its “culture” has
to</p>
<p>transcend community. Companies on which local communities depend

community.</p>
<p>Every one is perceived as “unfair.” Every one destabilizes.</p>
<p>It is the nature of the task that determines the culture of an
organization,</p>
<p>rather than the community in which that task is being performed. Each

only</p>
<p>hope and pray. Perhaps nothing beyond stoic resignation? Perhaps a

<p>Business can abandon an activity. Indeed, it is forced to do so if it

<p>Government becomes the master of civil society, able to mold and

<p>Until World War I, no government in history was ever able to obtain
from</p>
<p>its people more than a very small fraction of the country’s na-tional
income,</p>
<p>perhaps 5 or 6 percent. As long as revenues were known to be
limited,</p>
<p>governments, whether democracies or absolute monarchies like that of
the</p>
<p>Russian czars, operated under extreme restraints. These re-straints
made it</p>
<p>impossible for the government to act as either a social or an
economic agency.</p>
<p>But since World War I—and even more noticeably since World War
II—the</p>
<p>budgeting process has meant, in effect, saying yes to everything.
Under the</p>
<p>new dispensation, which assumes that there are no economic limits to
the</p>
<p>revenues it can obtain, government becomes the master of civil
society, able</p>
<p>to mold and shape it. Through the power of the purse, it can shape

be</p>
<p>answered only by looking at the business from the outside, from the
point of</p>
<p>view of the customer and the market. What the customer sees,

<p>What does the customer consider value?</p>
<p>The final question needed in order to come to grips with business
pur-pose</p>
<p>and business mission is: “What is value to the customer?” It may be
the most</p>
<p>important question. Yet it is the one least often asked. One rea-</p>
<p>son is that managers are quite sure that they know the answer. Value
is</p>
<p>what they, in their business, define as quality. But this is almost
always</p>
<p>the wrong definition. The customer never buys a product. By
definition</p>
<p>the customer buys the satisfaction of a want. He buys value.</p>
<p>For the teenage girl, for instance, value in a shoe is high fashion.
It has to</p>
<p>be “in.” Price is a secondary consideration and durability is not
value at all.</p>
<p>For the same girl as a young mother, a few years later, high fashion
be-comes</p>
<p>a restraint. She will not buy something that is quite unfashionable.
But what</p>
<p>she looks for is durability, price, comfort and fit, and so on. The
same shoe</p>
<p>that represents the best buy for the teenager is a very poor value
for her</p>
<p>slightly older sister. What a company’s different customers consider
value is</p>

<h3 id="the-change-leader">The Change Leader</h3>
<p>The most effective way to manage change successfully is to create
it.</p>
<p>One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it. In a period
of</p>
<p>upheavals, such as the one we are living in, change is the norm. To
be sure, it</p>
<p>is painful and risky, and above all it requires a great deal of very
hard work.</p>
<p>But unless it is seen as the task of the organization to lead change,
the</p>
<p>organization will not survive. In a period of rapid structural
change, the only</p>
<p>ones who survive are the change leaders. A change leader sees change
as an</p>
<p>opportunity. A change leader looks for change, knows how to find the
right</p>
<p>changes, and knows how to make them effective both outside the
or-</p>
<p>ganization and inside it. To make the future is highly risky. It is
less risky,</p>
<p>however, than not to try to make it. A goodly proportion of those
attempting</p>
<p>to will surely not succeed. But predictably, no one else will.</p>

<p>The test of an innovation is whether it creates value. Innovation
means the</p>
<p>creation of new value and new satisfaction for the customer. A
nov-elty only</p>
<p>creates amusement. Yet, again and again, managements decide to
innovate for</p>
<p>no other reason than that they are bored with doing the same thing or
making</p>
<p>the same product day in and day out. The test of an inno-vation, as
well as the</p>
<p>test of “quality,” is not “Do we like it?” It is “Do cus-</p>
<p>tomers want it and will they pay for it?”</p>
<p>Organizations measure innovations not by their scientific or
technolog-</p>
<p>ical importance but by what they contribute to market and customer.
They</p>
<p>consider social innovation to be as important as technological

<h3 id="knowledge-external-to-the-enterprise">Knowledge External to the
Enterprise</h3>
<p>The technologies that are likely to have the greatest impact on a
company</p>
<p>and an industry are technologies outside its own field.</p>
<p>Many changes that have transformed enterprises have originated
out-</p>
<p>side the specific industry of that enterprise. Here are three notable
examples.</p>
<p>The zipper was originally invented to close bales of heavy goods,
such as</p>
<p>grain, particularly in seaports. Nobody thought of using it for
cloth-ing. The</p>
<p>clothing industry did not think it could replace buttons. And the</p>
<p>inventor never dreamed it would be successful in the clothing
industry.</p>
<p>Commercial paper (that is, short-term notes originated by nonbank
fi-</p>
<p>nancial institutions) did not originate with banks, but had a
tremendous</p>
<p>negative impact on them. Under U.S. law, commercial paper is
considered a</p>
<p>security, which means that commercial banks cannot deal in it.
Because</p>
<p>financial services companies, such as Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch,
GE</p>
<p>Capital, and so on, discovered this, they have largely replaced
commercial</p>
<p>banks as the world’s most important and leading financial
institutions.</p>
<p>Fiberglass cable, the invention that has revolutionized the telephone
in-dustry,</p>
<p>did not come out of the great telephone research labs in the U.S.,
Japan, or</p>
<p>Germany. It came, rather, from a glass company, Corning.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-62">ACTION POINT:</h3>

<h3 id="in-innovation-emphasize-the-big-idea">In Innovation, Emphasize
the Big Idea</h3>
<p>Innovative ideas are like frogs’ eggs: of a thousand hatched,</p>
<p>only one or two survive to maturity.</p>
<p>The innovative organization understands that innovation starts with
an</p>
<p>idea. Ideas are somewhat like babies—they are born small, immature,
and</p>
<p>shapeless. They are promise rather than fulfillment. In the
innovative</p>
<p>organization executives do not say, “This is a damn-fool idea.”
Instead they</p>
<p>ask, “What would be needed to make this embryonic, half-baked,
foolish idea</p>
<p>into something that makes sense, that is feasible, that is an
opportunity</p>
<p>for us?”</p>
<p>But an innovative organization also knows that the great majority
of</p>
<p>ideas will turn out not to make sense. Executives in innovative
organiza-</p>
<p>tions therefore demand that people with ideas think through the
work</p>
<p>needed to turn an idea into a product, a process, a business, or a
technol-</p>
<p>ogy. They ask, “What work should we have to do and what would we</p>
<p>have to find out and learn before we can commit the company to this
idea</p>
<p>of yours?” These executives know that it is as difficult and risky
to</p>
<p>convert a small idea into successful reality as it is to make a
major</p>
<p>innovation. They do not aim at “improvements” or “modifications”
in</p>
<p>products or technol-ogy. They aim at innovating a new business.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-63">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Make a list of your three best ideas. Then make a list of the</p>

<h3 id="managing-for-the-future">Managing for the Future</h3>
<p>Prediction of future events is futile.</p>
<p>The starting point to know the future is the realization that there
are two</p>
<p>different, though complementary, approaches:</p>
<p>•Finding and exploiting the time lag between the appearance of a</p>
<p>discontinuity in the economy and society and its full impact—one</p>
<p>might call this anticipation of a future that has already
happened.</p>
<p>•Imposing on the yet unborn future a new idea that tries to give</p>
<p>direction and shape to what is to come. This one might call
making</p>
<p>the future happen.</p>
<p>The future that has already happened is not within the present</p>
<p>business; it is outside: a change in society, knowledge, culture,
industry,</p>
<p>or economic structure. It is, moreover, a major trend, a break in
the</p>
<p>pattern rather than a variation within it. Looking for the future
that has</p>
<p>already happened and anticipating its impacts introduces new
perception</p>
<p>in the beholder. The need is to make oneself see it. What then could
or</p>
<p>should be done is usually not too difficult to discover. The
opportunities</p>
<p>are neither remote nor ob-scure. The pattern has to be recognized
first.</p>

<p>Successful innovators are conservative.</p>
<p>Ionce attended a university symposium on entrepreneurship at which
a</p>
<p>number of psychologists spoke. Although their papers disagreed on</p>
<p>everything else, they all talked about an “entrepreneurial
personality,” which</p>
<p>was characterized by a “propensity for risk taking.” A well-known
and</p>
<p>successful innovator and entrepreneur who had built a
process-based</p>
<p>innovation into a substantial worldwide business in the space of
twenty-five</p>
<p>years was then asked to comment. He said: “I find myself baffled by
your</p>
<p>papers. I think I know as many successful innovators and
entrepreneurs as</p>
<p>anyone, beginning with myself. I have never come across an
’entrepre-neurial</p>
<p>personality.’ The successful ones I know all have, however, one
thing—and</p>
<p>only one thing—in common: they are not ‘risk takers.’ They try to
define the</p>
<p>risks they have to take and to minimize them as much as pos-</p>
<p>sible. Otherwise none of us could have succeeded.”</p>
<p>This jibes with my own experience. I, too, know a good many
successful</p>
<p>entrepreneurs. Not one of them has a “propensity for risk taking.”
Most suc-</p>

<p>Amanager has the task of creating a true whole that is larger than

sym-phony</p>
<p>orchestra, through whose effort, vision, and leadership
individual</p>
<p>instrumental parts become the living whole of a musical performance.
But</p>
<p>the conductor has the composer’s score; he is only interpreter. The

<p>ager is both composer and conductor.</p>
<p>The task of creating a genuine whole also requires that the manager,

<p>results of the enterprise as a whole and the diverse activities
needed to</p>

<p>always hear both the whole orchestra and, say, the second oboe.
Similarly,</p>
<p>a manager must always con-sider both the overall performance of
the</p>
<p>enterprise and, say, the market-research activity needed. By raising
the</p>
<p>performance of the whole, she creates scope and challenge for

makes</p>

business</p>
<p>performance is needed and what does this require of what

<p>organized for constant change. It will no longer be possible to

<p>Entrepreneurs see change as the norm and as healthy. Usually they do
not</p>
<p>bring about the change themselves. But—and this defines the
en-trepreneur</p>
<p>and entrepreneurship—the entrepreneur always searches for</p>
<p>change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity.</p>
<p>Look at every change, look out every window. And ask: “Could this
be</p>
<p>an opportunity?” “Is this new thing a genuine change or simply a
fad?”</p>
<p>The difference is very simple: A change is something people do, and a
fad</p>
<p>is something people talk about. An enormous amount of talk is a fad.
You</p>
<p>must also ask yourself if these transitions, these changes, are
an</p>
<p>opportunity or a threat. If you start out by looking at change as
threat, you</p>

not</p>

<p>directly and vitally affect the survival and prosperity of the
business.</p>
<p>There are eight areas in which performance and objectives have to be
set:</p>
<p>market standing, innovation, productivity, physical and financial</p>
<p>resources, profitability, manager performance and development,
worker</p>
<p>performance and atti-tude, and public responsibility. Different key
areas</p>
<p>require different em-phasis in different businesses—and different</p>
<p>emphasis at different stages of the development of each business. But
the</p>
<p>areas are the same, whatever the business, whatever the economic</p>
<p>conditions, whatever the business’s size or stage of growth.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-75">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>In addition to setting profit objectives, set objectives for your</p>
<p>business in the following areas: market standing, innovation,
produc-tivity,</p>
<p>physical and financial resources, profitability, manager performance
and</p>
<p>development, worker performance, and public responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="the-purpose-of-profit">The Purpose of Profit</h3>
<p>Profit is the ultimate test of business performance.</p>
<p>Profit serves three purposes. One is it measures the net
effectiveness and</p>
<p>soundness of a business’s efforts. Another is the “risk premium” that
covers</p>
<p>the costs of staying in business—replacement, obsolescence, market
risk and</p>
<p>uncertainty. Seen from this point of view, there is no such thing as
“profit”;</p>
<p>there are only “costs of being in business” and “costs of staying in
business.”</p>
<p>And the task of a business is to provide adequately for these “costs
of staying</p>
<p>in business” by earning an adequate profit. Finally, profit ensures
the supply</p>
<p>of future capital for innovation and expansion, either directly, by
providing</p>
<p>the means of self-financing out of retained earnings, or indi-rectly,
through</p>
<p>providing sufficient inducement for new outside capital in</p>
<p>the form in which it is best suited to the enterprise’s
objectives.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-76">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Decide to pull the plug on an unprofitable business if it is</p>
<p>not covering the cost required to stay in business or providing
enough</p>
<p>capital for future growth.</p>

<h3 id="morality-and-profits">Morality and Profits</h3>
<p>Is there sufficient profit?</p>
<p>Joseph Schumpeter’s “innovator,” with his “creative destruction,” is
the only</p>
<p>theory so far to explain why there is something we call “profit.” The
classical</p>
<p>economists very well knew that their theory did not give any
ra-tionale for profit.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the equilibrium economics of a closed eco-nomic system,
there is no</p>
<p>place for profit, no justification for it, no explanation of it. If
profit is, however, a</p>
<p>genuine cost, and especially if profit is the only way to maintain
jobs and to</p>
<p>create new ones, then capitalism be-</p>
<p>comes again a moral system.</p>
<p>The weakness on moral grounds of the profit incentive enabled Karl
Marx</p>
<p>at once to condemn the capitalist as wicked and immoral and
assert</p>
<p>“scientifically” that he serves no function. As soon, however, as one
shifts</p>
<p>from the axiom of an unchanging, self-contained, closed economy, what
is</p>
<p>called profit is no longer immoral. It becomes a moral imperative.
Indeed the</p>
<p>question then is no longer: “How can the economy be structured to
minimize</p>
<p>the bribe of the functionless surplus called profit that has to be
handed over to</p>
<p>the capitalist to keep the economy going?” The question in
Schumpeter’s</p>
<p>economics is always: “Is there sufficient profit?” Is there ade-quate
capital</p>
<p>formation to provide for the costs of the future, the costs of
staying in</p>
<p>business, the costs of “creative destruction”?</p>
<h3 id="action-point-77">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Check to see if you are earning enough profit to cover the</p>
<p>cost of capital and provide for innovation. If not, what are you
going to</p>
<p>do about it?</p>

<h3 id="defining-corporate-performance">Defining Corporate
Performance</h3>
<p>Maximize the wealth-producing capacity of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Ralph Cordiner, CEO of the General Electric Company from 1958 to</p>
<p>1963, asserted that top management in the large, publicly owned
cor-poration</p>
<p>was a “trustee.” Cordiner argued that senior executives were
re-sponsible for</p>
<p>managing the enterprise “in the best-balanced interest of
shareholders,</p>
<p>customers, employees, suppliers, and plant community cities.” That is
what</p>
<p>we now call “stakeholders.” Cordiner’s answer still re-quired a
clear</p>
<p>definition of results and of the meaning of “best” with respect to
“balance.”</p>
<p>We no longer need to theorize about how to define perfor-</p>
<p>mance and results in the large enterprise. We have successful
examples.</p>
<p>Both the Germans and the Japanese have highly concentrated
institu-</p>
<p>tional ownership. How, then, do the institutional owners of German or
Japa-</p>
<p>nese industry define performance and results? Though they manage
quite</p>
<p>differently, they define them in the same way. Unlike Cordiner, they
do not</p>
<p>“balance” anything. They maximize. But they do not attempt to
maximize</p>
<p>shareholder value or the short-term interest of any one of the
enterprise’s</p>
<p>“stakeholders.” Rather, they maximize the wealth-producing capacity
of the</p>
<p>enterprise. It is this objective that integrates short-term and
long-term results</p>
<p>and that ties the operational dimensions of business
performance—market</p>
<p>standing, innovation, productivity, and people and their development—
with</p>
<p>financial needs and financial results. It is also this objective on
which all the</p>
<p>constituencies—whether shareholders, customers, or employees— depend
for</p>
<p>the satisfaction of their expectations and objectives.</p>

<p>The things that the proponents of “management audits” talk about—</p>
<p>integrity and creativity, for instance—are better left to the
novelist.</p>
<p>The “bottom line” measures business performance rather than
manage-</p>
<p>ment performance. And the performance of a business today is largely
a result</p>
<p>of the performance of management in years past. Performance in</p>
<p>management, therefore, means in large measure doing a good job of</p>
<p>preparing today’s business for the future. The future of a business
is</p>
<p>largely formed by present-management performance in four areas:</p>
<p>•Performance in appropriating capital: We need to measure</p>
<p>the return on investment against the return expected.</p>
<p>•Performance in people decisions: Neither what is expected of a</p>
<p>person’s performance when he or she is put into the job, nor how</p>
<p>the appointment works out, is “intangible.” Both can be fairly
easily</p>
<p>judged.</p>
<p>•Performance in innovation: Research results can be appraised,</p>
<p>and then projected backward on the promises and expectations at</p>
<p>the time the research effort was started.</p>
<p>•Strategies versus performance: Did the things that the strategy</p>
<p>expected to happen take place? And were the goals set the right</p>
<p>goals in light of actual developments? Have they been attained?</p>

<p>E-commerce is to the information revolution what the railroad was

<p>Statistically, multinational companies play much the same part in
the</p>
<p>world economy today as they did in 1913. But they have become
very</p>
<p>different animals. Multinationals in 1913 were domestic firms with
sub-</p>

politically de-</p>
<p>fined territory, and highly autonomous. Multinationals now tend to
be</p>
<p>organized globally along product or service lines. But like the

joint</p>

<p>The traditional axiom that an enterprise should aim for maximum</p>
<p>inte-gration is becoming obsolete in the new corporation. There are
two</p>
<p>explanations for the “disintegration” of the enterprise. First,
knowledge</p>

increasingly</p>
<p>ex-pensive, and also it is increasingly difficult to maintain enough
critical</p>
<p>mass for every major task within an enterprise. And because

<p>Parts exist in contemplation of the whole.</p>
<p>There is one fundamental insight underlying all management science.
It is</p>
<p>that the business enterprise is a system of the highest order: a
sys-tem whose</p>
<p>parts are human beings contributing voluntarily of their knowl-edge,
skill,</p>

biological</p>
<p>like a tree, or social like the business enterprise: it is
interde-pendence. The</p>
<p>whole of a system is not necessarily improved if one particular
function or</p>
<p>part is improved or made more efficient. In fact, the system may well
be</p>

strengthen</p>

<h3 id="management-as-a-human-endeavor">Management as a Human
Endeavor</h3>
<p>Management is about human beings.</p>
<p>The modern enterprise is a human and social organization.
Manage-ment</p>
<p>as a discipline and as a practice deals with human and social
val-ues. To be</p>
<p>sure, the organization exists for an end beyond itself. In the case
of business</p>
<p>enterprise, the end is economic; in the case of the hospital, it is
the care of the</p>
<p>patient and his or her recovery; in the case of the university, it is
teaching,</p>
<p>learning, and research. To achieve these ends, the peculiar modern
invention</p>
<p>we call management organizes human beings for joint performance
and</p>
<p>creates social organization. But only when management succeeds in
making</p>
<p>the human resources of the organization productive is</p>
<p>it able to attain the desired outside objectives and results.</p>
<p>Management is no more a science than is medicine: both are
practices.</p>
<p>A practice feeds from a large body of true sciences. Just as medicine
feeds</p>
<p>off biology, chemistry, physics, and a host of other natural
sciences, so</p>
<p>management feeds off economics, psychology, mathematics, political
the-</p>
<p>ory, history, and philosophy. But like medicine, management is also
a</p>
<p>disci-pline in its own right, with its own assumptions, its own aims,
its</p>
<p>own tools, and its own performance goals and measurements.</p>

<p>work group, for her contribution to the performance and results of
the</p>
<p>entire organization, and for the social tasks of the work
community.</p>
<p>Responsibility, therefore, is both external and internal. Externally
it im-</p>

for</p>
<p>specific performance. Internally it implies commitment. The
Responsible</p>

not</p>

<p>Leadership is a foul-weather job.</p>
<p>The most successful leader of the twentieth century was Winston</p>

totally</p>

a</p>
<p>Churchill. Things were routine or, at any rate, looked routine. When

crisis. That al-</p>

<p>The most important task of an organization’s leader is to anticipate
cri-sis.</p>
<p>Perhaps not to avert it, but to anticipate it. To wait until crisis
hits is ab-</p>
<p>dication. One has to make the organization capable of anticipating
the storm,</p>

<p>Keep your eye on the task, not on yourself.</p>
<p>The task matters, and you are a servant.</p>
<p>Most organizations need somebody who can lead regardless of the</p>
<p>weather. What matters is that he or she works on the basic
compe-tencies. As</p>
<p>the first such basic competence, I would put the willingness,
ability, and self-</p>
<p>discipline to listen. Listening is not a skill; it is a discipline.
Anybody can do</p>
<p>it. All you have to do is to keep your mouth shut. The sec-ond
essential</p>
<p>competence is the willingness to communicate, to make your-self
understood.</p>
<p>That requires infinite patience. The next important competence is not
to alibi.</p>
<p>Say: “This doesn’t work as well as it should. Let’s take it back and
reengineer</p>
<p>it.” The last basic competence is the willing-ness to realize how
unimportant</p>
<p>you are compared to the task. Leaders sub-</p>
<p>ordinate themselves to the task.</p>
<p>When effective leaders have the capacity to maintain their
personality</p>
<p>and individuality, even though they are totally dedicated, the task
will go</p>
<p>on after them. They also have a human existence outside of the task.
Oth-</p>
<p>erwise they do things for personal aggrandizement, in the belief that
this</p>
<p>furthers the cause. They become self-centered and vain. And above
all,</p>

<p>All one could do in 1939 was pray and hope.</p>
<p>But this is hindsight. Winston Churchill appears in The End of
Eco-nomic</p>
<p>Man and is treated with great respect. Indeed, reading now what I
then wrote,</p>
<p>I suspect that I secretly hoped that Churchill would indeed</p>
<p>emerge into leadership. I also never fell for the ersatz leaders to
whom a</p>
<p>good many well-informed contemporaries—a good many members of</p>
<p>Franklin Roosevelt’s entourage in Washington, for instance—looked
for</p>
<p>deliverance. Yet in 1939 Churchill was a might-have-been: a
powerless</p>
<p>old man rapidly approaching seventy; a Cassandra who bored his
listeners</p>
<p>in spite (or perhaps because) of his impassioned rhetoric; a two-time

the</p>
<p>“Men of Munich” were swept out of office by the fall of France and
the</p>

<p>Churchill’s emergence in 1940, more than a year after the book was

values for</p>
<p>which The End of Economic Man had prayed and hoped. But all one could

<p>The last reality of the thirties, which The End of Economic Man

full of</p>
<p>characters. Never before, it seems, had there been so many
politicians,</p>
<p>working so frenziedly. Quite a few of these politicians were decent
men,</p>
<p>some even very able ones. But excepting the twin Princes of Darkness,
Adolf</p>
<p>Hitler and Joseph Stalin, they were all pathetically small men;
even</p>
<p>mediocrities were conspicuous by their absence. “But,” today’s reader

emergence as</p>
<p>the leader in Europe’s fight against the evil forces of
totalitarianism was the</p>
<p>crucial event. It was, to use a Churchillian phrase, “the hinge of
fate.”</p>
<p>Today’s reader is indeed likely to underrate Churchill’s
importance.</p>
<p>Until Churchill took over as leader of free peoples everywhere, after
the</p>
<p>re-treat at Dunkirk and the fall of France, Hitler had moved with
apparent</p>
<p>in-fallibility. After Churchill, Hitler was “off” for good, never

<p>his sense of timing or his uncanny ability to anticipate every
opponent’s</p>
<p>slight-est move. The shrewd calculator of the thirties became the
wild,</p>

sixty-five</p>

<p>jobs have to be to attract and hold the kind of people we need and
want? What is</p>
<p>the supply available on the job market? And, what do we have to do to
attract it?”</p>
<p>It is highly desirable to have specific objectives for manager
supply,</p>
<p>development, and performance, but also specific objec-tives for major
groups</p>
<p>within the nonmanagerial workforce. There is need</p>
<p>for objectives for employee attitudes as well as for employee
skills.</p>
<p>The first sign of decline of an industry is loss of appeal to
qualified,</p>
<p>able, and ambitious people. The American railroads, for instance, did
not</p>
<p>begin their decline after World War II—it only became obvious and</p>
<p>irreversible then. The decline actually set in around the time of
World War</p>
<p>I. Before World War I, able graduates of American engineering
schools</p>
<p>looked for a railroad career. From the end of World War I on—for</p>
<p>whatever reason— the railroads no longer appealed to young
engineering</p>
<p>graduates, or to any educated young people. As a result, there was
nobody</p>
<p>in management ca-pable and competent to cope with new problems
when</p>
<p>the railroads ran into heavy weather twenty years later.</p>

<p>Don’t hire a person for what they can’t do; hire them for what they
can do.</p>
<p>Avery great leader of men, General George C. Marshall, chief of staff
of</p>
<p>the U.S. Army during World War II, had the most remarkable record
of</p>
<p>putting people into the right place at the right time. He appointed
some-</p>
<p>thing like six hundred people to positions as general officer,
division com-</p>
<p>mander, and so on, almost without a dud. And not one of these people
had</p>
<p>ever commanded troops before. A discussion would come up, and
Mar-shall’s</p>
<p>aides would say, “Colonel So-and-So is the best trainer of people we
have,</p>
<p>but he has never gotten along with his boss. If he has to testify
before</p>
<p>Congress, he’ll be a disaster. He is so rude.” Marshall would then
ask, “What</p>
<p>is the assignment? To train a division? If he is first-rate as a
trainer, put him</p>
<p>in. The rest is my job.” As a result, he created the largest army the
world had</p>
<p>ever seen, thirteen million people, in the shortest possible time,
with very few</p>
<p>mistakes. The lesson is to focus on strengths.</p>

<h3 id="decision-steps-for-picking-people">Decision Steps for Picking
People</h3>
<p>The most important thing is that the person and the assignment fit
each other.</p>
<p>General George C. Marshall followed Five Simple Decision Steps in</p>
<p>making people decisions. First, Marshall carefully thought through
the</p>
<p>assignment. Job descriptions may last a long time, but job
assignments</p>
<p>change all the time. Second, Marshall always looked at several
qualified</p>
<p>people. Formal qualifications, such as those listed in a résumé, are
no more</p>
<p>than a starting point. Their absence disqualifies a candidate.
However, the</p>
<p>most important thing is that the person and the assignment fit each
other. To</p>
<p>find the best fit, you must consider at least three to five
candidates. Third,</p>
<p>Marshall studied the performance records of all three to five
candidates to</p>
<p>find what each did well. He looked for the candidate’s strengths. The
things a</p>
<p>person cannot do are of little importance; instead, you must
concentrate on</p>
<p>the things they can do and determine whether they are the right
strengths for</p>
<p>this particular assignment. Performance can only be built on
strengths.</p>
<p>Fourth, Marshall discussed the candidates with others who had worked
with</p>
<p>them. The best information often comes through informal dis-cussions
with a</p>
<p>candidate’s former bosses and colleagues. And fifth, once the
decision was</p>
<p>made, Marshall made sure the appointee understood the assignment.
Perhaps</p>
<p>the best way to do this is to ask the new person to care-fully think
over what</p>
<p>they have to do to be a success, and then, ninety days into the job,
have the</p>
<p>person commit it to writing.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-108">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Follow these five decision steps when hiring someone:</p>
<p>Understand the job, consider three to five people, study candidates
perfor-</p>
<p>mance records to find their strengths, talk to the candidates’
colleagues</p>
<p>about them, and once hired, explain the assignment to the new
employee.</p>

<h3 id="placements-that-fail">Placements That Fail</h3>
<p>The soldier has a right to competent command.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a perfect record in making people
decisions.</p>
<p>Successful executives follow five ground rules. First, the executive
must</p>
<p>accept responsibility for any placement that fails. To blame the
non-performer</p>
<p>is a cop-out. The executive made a mistake in selecting that
par-ticular</p>
<p>person. But second, the executive does have the responsibility to
remove</p>
<p>people who do not perform. The incompetent or poor performer, when
left in</p>
<p>his or her job, penalizes all others and demoralizes the entire
organization.</p>
<p>Third, just because a person doesn’t perform in the job he or she was
put in</p>
<p>doesn’t mean that that person is a bad worker whom the company should
let</p>
<p>go. It only means that he or she is in the wrong job. Fourth, the
executive</p>
<p>must try to make the right people decisions for every position.
An</p>
<p>organization can only perform to the capacity of its individual
workers; thus</p>
<p>people decisions must be right. And fifth, newcomers best be put in
an</p>
<p>established position where the expectations are known and help is
available.</p>
<p>New major assignments should mainly go to people whose be-haviors
and</p>
<p>habits are well known and who have already earned trust and</p>
<p>credibility.</p>

<p>The most critical people decision, and the one that is hardest to
undo,</p>
<p>is the succession to the top.</p>
<p>The succession to the top decision is the most difficult because
every such</p>
<p>decision is a gamble. The only test of performance in the top
po-sition is</p>
<p>performance in the top position—and there is very little prepara-tion
for it.</p>
<p>What not to do is fairly simple. You don’t want a carbon copy of the
outgoing</p>
<p>CEO. If the outgoing CEO says, “Joe [or Mary] is just like me thirty
years</p>
<p>ago,” that’s a carbon copy—and carbon copies are always weak. Be a
little</p>
<p>leery, too, of the faithful assistant who for eighteen years has been
at the</p>
<p>boss’s side anticipating his or her every wish, but has never made a
de-cision</p>
<p>alone. By and large, people who are willing and able to make
deci-sions don’t</p>
<p>stay in the assistant role very long. Stay away, too, from the
anointed prince.</p>
<p>Nine times out of ten that’s a person who has managed to avoid ever

<p>During the years in which I attended the meetings of GM’s top
com-</p>

as</p>
<p>capital investments; overseas expansion; the balance between

<p>Authority without responsibility is illegitimate;</p>
<p>but so is responsibility without authority.</p>
<p>“Public” responsibility was to Alfred Sloan worse than
unprofessional; it</p>
<p>was irresponsible, a usurpation of power. “We have a responsibility
to-ward</p>
<p>higher education,” a chief executive of a major American corporation
once</p>
<p>said at a meeting both Sloan and I attended. “Do we in business have
any</p>
<p>authority over higher education?” Sloan asked. “Should we have any?”
“Of</p>
<p>course not,” was the answer. “Then let’s not talk about
‘responsibility,’” said</p>
<p>Sloan with asperity. “You are a senior executive in a big company and
you</p>
<p>know the first rule: authority and responsibility must be congruent
and</p>
<p>commensurate to each other. If you don’t want authority and shouldn’t
have it,</p>
<p>don’t talk about responsibility. And if you don’t want
responsibility</p>
<p>and shouldn’t have it, don’t talk about authority.”</p>
<p>Sloan based this on management principles. But of course it is the
first</p>
<p>lesson of political theory and political history. Authority without
responsi-</p>
<p>bility is illegitimate; but so is responsibility without authority.
Both lead to</p>
<p>tyranny. Sloan wanted a great deal of authority for his professional
man-ager,</p>
<p>and was ready to take high responsibility. But for that reason he

<p>What is business ethics? “It’s casuistry,” the historian of Western
phi-</p>

their</p>

demands</p>
<p>of ethics that apply to them as individuals and their social
responsibility to</p>
<p>their kingdom. But this implies that the rules that decide what is
ethical for</p>
<p>ordinary people do not apply equally, if at all, to those with social
responsi-</p>
<p>bility. Ethics for them is instead a cost-benefit calculation
involving the de-</p>
<p>mands of individual conscience and the demands of position—and that
means</p>
<p>that the rulers are exempt from the demands of ethics, if only their
behavior</p>
<p>can be argued to confer benefits on other people.</p>

<p>The developed countries are moving fast toward a Network Society.</p>
<p>For well over a hundred years, all developed countries were
moving</p>
<p>steadily toward an employee society of organizations. Now the
devel-oped</p>
<p>countries, with the United States in the lead, are moving fast toward
a</p>
<p>Network Society in respect to the relationship between organizations
and</p>
<p>individuals who work for them, and in respect to the relationships
between</p>
<p>different organizations.</p>
<p>Most adults in the U.S. labor force do work for an organization. But
in-</p>
<p>creasingly they are not employees of that organization. They are
contrac-tors,</p>
<p>part-timers, temporaries. And relations between organizations are
changing</p>
<p>just as fast as the relations between organizations and the people
who work</p>
<p>for them. The most visible example is “outsourcing,” in which a
company, a</p>
<p>hospital, or a government agency turns over an entire activity to
an</p>
<p>independent firm that specializes in that kind of work. Even more
im-portant</p>
<p>may be the trend toward alliances. Individual professionals and
ex-ecutives</p>
<p>will have to learn that they must take responsibility for placing
themselves.</p>
<p>This means above all they must know their strengths and look upon</p>
<p>themselves as “products” that have to be marketed.</p>

<h3 id="global-competitiveness">Global Competitiveness</h3>
<p>“Think globally, act locally.”</p>
<p>Strategy has to accept a new fundamental. Any institution—and not
just</p>
<p>businesses—has to measure itself against the standards set by each
in-dustry’s</p>
<p>leaders anyplace in the world. Given the ease and speed at which
information</p>
<p>travels, every institution in the knowledge society has to be
globally</p>
<p>competitive, even though most organizations will continue to be local
in their</p>
<p>activities and markets. This is because the Internet will keep
customers</p>
<p>everywhere informed on what is available anywhere in the world, and
at what</p>
<p>price. E-commerce will create new global channels for</p>
<p>commerce and wealth distribution.</p>
<p>Here is an example. An entrepreneur developed a highly successful
en-</p>
<p>gineering design firm in Mexico. He complains that one of his
toughest</p>
<p>jobs is to convince associates and colleagues that the competition is
no</p>
<p>longer merely Mexican. Even without the physical presence of
competi-</p>
<p>tors, the Internet allows customers to stay abreast of global
offerings and</p>
<p>de-mand the same quality of designs in Mexico. This executive
must</p>
<p>convince his associates that the competition faced by the firm is
global</p>
<p>and the per-formance of the firm must be compared against global</p>
<p>competitors, not just those in Mexico.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-123">ACTION POINT:</h3>

<h3 id="characteristics-of-the-next-society">Characteristics of the Next
Society</h3>
<p>Every institution in the knowledge society has to be globally
competitive.</p>
<p>The next society will be a knowledge society. Its three main
characteris-tics will</p>
<p>be:</p>
<p>•Borderlessness, because knowledge travels even more</p>
<p>effortlessly than money.</p>
<p>•Upward mobility, available to everyone through easily</p>
<p>acquired formal education.</p>
<p>•The potential for failure as well as success. Anyone can acquire</p>
<p>the “means of production,” that is, the knowledge required for
the</p>
<p>job, but not everyone can win.</p>
<p>Together, those three characteristics will make the knowledge society
a</p>
<p>highly competitive one, for organizations and individuals alike.</p>
<p>Information technology, although only one of many new features of</p>
<p>the next society, is already having one hugely important effect: it
is</p>
<p>allowing knowledge to spread near-instantly, and making it accessible
to</p>
<p>everyone. Given the ease and speed at which information travels,
every</p>
<p>institution in the knowledge society—not only businesses, but
also</p>
<p>schools, universities, hospitals, and increasingly, government
agencies,</p>
<p>too—has to be globally competitive, even though most organizations
will</p>
<p>continue to be local in their activities and in their markets. This
is because</p>
<p>the Internet will keep customers everywhere informed on what is</p>
<p>available anywhere in the world, and at what price.</p>

<p>Each of the new institutions perceives its own purpose as
central,</p>
<p>as ultimate value, and as the one thing that really matters.</p>
<p>The new pluralist organization of society has no interest in
government or</p>
<p>governance. Unlike the earlier pluralist institutions, it is not a
“whole.” As</p>
<p>such, its results are entirely on the outside. The product of a
business is a</p>
<p>satisfied customer. The product of a hospital is a cured patient. The
“product”</p>
<p>of the school is a student who ten years later puts to work</p>
<p>what he or she has learned.</p>
<p>In some ways the new pluralism is thus far more flexible, far
less</p>
<p>divisive than the old pluralism. The new institutions do not encroach
on</p>
<p>political power as did the old pluralist institutions, whether the
medieval</p>
<p>church, feudal baron, or free city. The new institutions, however,
unlike</p>
<p>the old ones, do not share identical concerns or see the same world.
Each</p>
<p>of the new institutions perceives its own purpose as central, as
ultimate</p>
<p>value, and as the one thing that really matters. Every institution
speaks its</p>
<p>own lan-guage, has its own knowledge, its own career ladder, and
above</p>
<p>all, its own values. No one of them sees itself as responsible for

<p>Knowledge without skill is unproductive.</p>
<p>At present, the term “knowledge worker” is widely used to describe
peo-</p>

These</p>

Employees</h3>
<p>The challenge to executives is to coordinate efforts</p>
<p>of all categories of workers.</p>
<p>Along with full-time employees, PEOs, and temp workers, there may
also</p>
<p>be a closely linked but separately managed organization made up
of</p>
<p>nontraditional employees in the new corporation. Increasingly,
employ-</p>
<p>ees take early retirement but they do not stop working. Instead,
their “sec-</p>
<p>ond career” often takes an unconventional form. They may work</p>
<p>freelance, or part-time, or as temporaries, or for an outsourcing</p>
<p>contractor, or as con-tractors themselves. Such “early retirement to
keep</p>
<p>on working” is particu-larly common among knowledge workers.</p>
<p>Attracting and holding these diverse groups will become the central
tasks</p>
<p>of people management in the new corporation. These people do not
have</p>
<p>permanent relationships with the business. They may not have to be
managed,</p>
<p>but they have to be made productive. They will therefore have to be
deployed</p>
<p>where their specialized knowledge can make the greatest
con-tribution.</p>
<p>Managers need to work closely with their counterparts in the
outsource</p>
<p>contractor organization on the professional development,
moti-vation,</p>
<p>satisfaction, and productivity of these nontraditional workers.</p>

<h3 id="the-corporation-as-confederation">The Corporation as
Confederation</h3>
<p>From corporation to confederation.</p>
<p>Here are two prominent examples of the corporation as a
confedera-tion.</p>
<p>Eighty years ago General Motors first developed both the
orga-nizational</p>
<p>concepts and the organizational structure upon which today’s
large</p>
<p>corporations everywhere are based. And it was based for seventy-five
of these</p>
<p>eighty years on two basic principles. We own as much as possible
of</p>
<p>whatever we manufacture and we own everything we do. Now it is
experi-</p>
<p>menting with becoming the minority partner in competing companies:
Saab</p>
<p>in Sweden, Suzuki and Isuzu in Japan, and it’s about to become
the</p>
<p>controlling minority partner of Fiat. At the same time, it has
divested itself</p>
<p>of 70 or 80 percent of what it manufactures.</p>
<p>The second example goes exactly the other way. It’s Toyota, which for
the</p>
<p>last twenty years or so has been the most successful automotive
com-pany. It</p>
<p>is restructuring itself around its core competency—manufacturing. It
is</p>
<p>moving away from having multiple suppliers of parts and accessories
to</p>
<p>having only one or two everyplace. At the same time, it uses its
manufac-</p>
<p>turing competence to manage these suppliers. They remain
independent</p>
<p>companies but they are basically part of Toyota in terms of
management.</p>

Syndicate</h3>
<p>The model for the syndicate is the nineteenth-century farmers’
cooperative.</p>
<p>The approaches at GM and Toyota, however different, still take the
tra-ditional</p>
<p>corporation as their point of departure. But there are also</p>
<p>some new ideas that do away with the corporate model altogether.</p>
<p>One example is a “syndicate” being tested by several noncompeting</p>
<p>manufacturers in the European Union. Each of the constituent
companies is</p>
<p>medium-sized, family-owned, and owner-managed. Each is a leader in
a</p>
<p>narrow, highly engineered product line. Each is heavily
export-dependent.</p>
<p>The individual companies intend to remain independent, and to
continue to</p>
<p>design their products separately. They will also continue to make
them in</p>
<p>their own plants for their main markets, and to sell them in these
mar-kets.</p>
<p>But for other markets, and especially for emerging or
less-developed</p>
<p>countries, the syndicate will arrange for the making of the products,
either in</p>
<p>syndicate-owned plants producing for several of the members or by
local</p>
<p>contract manufacturers. The syndicate will handle the delivery of all
mem-</p>
<p>bers’ products, and service them in all markets. Each member will own
a</p>
<p>share of the syndicate, and the syndicate, in turn, will own a small
share of</p>
<p>each member’s capital. If this sounds familiar, it is because the
model is the</p>
<p>nineteenth-century farmers’ cooperative.</p>

Productive</h3>
<p>Knowledge work includes manual operations</p>
<p>that require industrial engineering.</p>
<p>Frederick Winslow Taylor’s principles sound deceptively simple. The
first</p>
<p>step in making the manual worker productive is to look at the task
and to</p>
<p>analyze its constituent motions. The next step is to record each
mo-tion, the</p>
<p>physical effort it takes and the time it takes. Then motions that are
not needed</p>
<p>can be eliminated. Then each of the motions that remain as es-sential
to</p>
<p>obtaining the finished product is set up so as to be done the
sim-plest way, the</p>
<p>easiest way, the way that puts the least physical and mental strain
on the</p>
<p>operator, the way that requires the least time. Then these mo-tions
are put</p>
<p>together again into a “job” that is in logical sequence. Finally,</p>
<p>the tools needed to do the motions are redesigned.</p>
<p>Taylor’s approach is still going to be the organizing principle in
coun-</p>
<p>tries in which manual work is the growth sector of society and
economy.</p>
<p>In developed countries the challenge is no longer to make manual
work</p>
<p>pro-ductive. The central challenge will be to make knowledge
workers</p>
<p>produc-tive. But, there is a tremendous amount of knowledge work—</p>

<h3 id="productivity-of-service-work">Productivity of Service Work</h3>
<p>Raising the productivity of service work is the first</p>
<p>social responsibility of management.</p>
<p>The need to raise the productivity of service work is a social
priority in</p>
<p>developed countries. Unless it is met, the developed world faces
in-creasing</p>
<p>social tensions, increasing polarization, increasing radicalization.
It may</p>
<p>increasingly face a new class war. Unless the productivity of service
work is</p>
<p>rapidly improved, both the social and economic position of a large
class—as</p>
<p>large a group as people making and moving things ever were at their
peak—</p>
<p>must steadily go down. Real incomes cannot for any length of time be
higher</p>
<p>than productivity. The service workers may use their nu-merical
strength to</p>
<p>get higher wages than their economic contribution jus-tifies. But
this only</p>
<p>impoverishes all of society with everybody’s real income going down
and</p>
<p>unemployment going up. Or the incomes of the unskilled workers are
allowed</p>
<p>to go down in relation to the steadily rising wages of the affluent
knowledge</p>
<p>workers, with an increasing gulf between the two groups, an
increasing</p>
<p>polarization into classes. In either case the service workers must
become</p>
<p>alienated, increasingly bitter, increasingly see them-</p>
<p>selves as a class apart.</p>
<p>We know how to raise service work productivity. This is
production</p>
<p>work and what we have learned during the past hundred years about</p>
<p>increasing productivity applies to such work with minimum
adaptation.</p>
<p>The task is known and doable, but the urgency is great. It is, in

<p>Improving the productivity of service workers will demand
fundamental</p>
<p>changes in the structure of organizations. Service work in many cases
will be</p>
<p>contracted out of the organization to whom the service is being
ren-dered.</p>
<p>This applies particularly to support work, such as maintenance, and
to a good</p>
<p>deal of clerical work. “Outsourcing,” moreover, will be applied
increasingly</p>
<p>to such work as drafting for architects and to the technical or

But</p>
<p>nobody in senior management is likely to be much interested in this
kind</p>
<p>of work, know enough about it, care greatly for it, or even consider
it</p>
<p>impor-tant. Such work does not fit the organization’s value system.
In the</p>
<p>hospital, for instance, the value system is that of the doctors and
nurses.</p>
<p>They are concerned with patient care. No one therefore pays much</p>
<p>attention to maintenance work, support work, clerical work. We
should</p>
<p>therefore ex-pect within a fairly short period of years to find such
work</p>

<p>Knowledge-worker productivity demands that we ask the</p>

<p>have to manage themselves. They have to have autonomy.</p>
<p>Continuing innovation has to be part of the work, the task, and
the</p>
<p>responsibility of knowledge workers.</p>
<p>Knowledge work requires continuous learning on the part of the</p>
<p>knowledge worker, but equally continuous teaching on the part of</p>
<p>the knowledge worker.</p>
<p>Productivity of the knowledge worker is not—at least not</p>
<p>primarily—a matter of the quantity of output. Quality is at least</p>
<p>as important.</p>
<p>Finally, knowledge-worker productivity requires that the</p>
<p>knowledge worker be both seen and treated as an “asset” rather</p>

<p>In knowledge work, the how only comes after the what has been

<p>In manual work the task is always given. Wherever there still are
domestic</p>
<p>servants, the owner of the house tells them what to do. The machine
or the</p>
<p>assembly line programs the factory worker. But, in knowledge work,
what to do</p>
<p>becomes the first and decisive question. For knowledge workers are
not</p>
<p>programmed by the machine. They largely are in control of their own
tasks and</p>
<p>must be in control of their own tasks. For they, and only they, own
and control</p>
<p>the most expensive of the means of production—their ed-ucation—and
their</p>
<p>most important tool—their knowledge. They do use other tools, of
course,</p>
<p>whether the nurse’s IV or the engineer’s computer. But their
knowledge decides</p>
<p>how these tools are being used and for what. They know what steps are
most</p>
<p>important and what methods need to be used to complete the tasks; and
it is their</p>
<p>knowledge that tells them what</p>
<p>chores are unnecessary and should be eliminated.</p>

<p>Hence the next and crucial step in making the knowledge worker

<p>Measuring quality in knowledge work sounds formidable.</p>
<p>In practice, it defines itself.</p>
<p>In some knowledge work—and especially in some work requiring a
high</p>
<p>degree of knowledge—we already measure quality. Surgeons, for
in-stance, are</p>
<p>routinely measured, by their success rates in difficult and
dan-gerous procedures,</p>
<p>for example, by the survival rates of their open-heart surgical
patients. But by</p>
<p>and large we have, so far, mainly judgments rather than measures
regarding the</p>
<p>quality of a great deal of knowledge work. The main trouble is,
however, not the</p>
<p>difficulty of measuring quality. It is the</p>
<p>difficulty in defining what the task is and what it should be.</p>
<p>The best example is the American school. Public schools in the

<p>can inner city have become disaster areas. But next to them—in the
same</p>
<p>location and serving the same kinds of children—are private schools
in</p>
<p>which the kids behave well and learn well. There is endless
speculation to</p>
<p>explain these enormous quality differences. But a major reason is
surely</p>
<p>that the two kinds of schools define their tasks differently. The
typical</p>
<p>pub-lic school defines its task as “helping the underprivileged”;
the</p>
<p>typical pri-vate school (and especially the parochial schools of
the</p>
<p>Catholic church) define their task as “enabling those who want to

<p>The beacons of productivity and innovation must be our guideposts.
If</p>
<p>we achieve profits at the cost of downgrading productivity or not

<p>The best example of a large and successful information-based

<li>The Indian civil service never had more than one thousand members

country-man a</p>
<p>day or two of travel away, and for the first hundred years there was
no</p>
<p>telegraph or railroad.</p>
<p>The organization structure was totally flat. Each district officer
reported</p>

there were</p>
<p>nine provinces, each political secretary had at least one hundred
peo-ple</p>
<p>reporting directly to him. Each month the district officer spent a

<p>writing a full report to the political secretary in the provincial
capital. He</p>
<p>discussed each of his principal tasks. He put down in detail what he
had</p>
<p>expected would happen with respect to each of them, what actually
did</p>
<p>happen, and why, if there was a discrepancy, the two differed. Then
he wrote</p>
<p>down what he expected would happen in the ensuing month with re-spect
to</p>
<p>each key task and what he was going to do about it, asked questions
about</p>
<p>policy, and commented on long-term opportunities, threats, and needs.

clear,</p>

<p>Arequirement of an information-based organization is that everyone

<p>Information-based organizations rest on responsibility. The flow

<p>The regulation of pension funds, and their protection against
looting,</p>
<p>will remain a challenge.</p>
<p>For most people over forty-five in developed countries, their stake
in a</p>
<p>pension fund is one of their largest single assets. During the
nineteenth</p>
<p>century, the biggest financial need of common people was for life
insur-ance</p>
<p>to protect their families in the event of their early death. With
life ex-</p>
<p>pectancies now almost double those of the nineteenth century, the
biggest</p>
<p>need of common people today is protection against the threat of
living too</p>
<p>long. The nineteenth-century “life insurance” was really “death
insur-ance.”</p>
<p>The pension fund is “old-age” insurance. It is an essential
institution in a</p>
<p>society in which most people can expect to outlive their working
lives</p>
<p>by many years.</p>
<p>The regulation of pension funds, and their protection against
looting,</p>
<p>will remain a challenge to policy makers and lawmakers for years

<p>A clear, simple, and penetrating theory of the business,</p>
<p>rather than intuition, characterizes the truly successful
entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Atheory of the business has three parts. First, there are assumptions
about</p>
<p>the environment of the organization: society and its structure, the
market, the</p>
<p>customer, and technology. The assumptions about the en-</p>
<p>vironment define what an organization is paid for. Second, there are
as-</p>
<p>sumptions about the specific mission of the organization. The
assumptions</p>
<p>about mission define what an organization considers to be meaningful
re-</p>
<p>sults—they point to how it envisions itself making a difference in
the</p>
<p>econ-omy and society at large. Third, there are assumptions about
the</p>
<p>core competencies needed to accomplish the organization’s mission.
Core</p>
<p>com-petencies define where an organization must excel in order to</p>
<p>maintain leadership.</p>
<p>Every one of the great business builders we know of—from the
Medici</p>
<p>and the founders of the Bank of England down to IBM’s Thomas
Watson</p>
<p>in our day—had a definite idea, had, indeed, a clear theory of
the</p>
<p>business that informed his actions and decisions. A clear, simple,
and</p>
<p>penetrating theory of the business, rather than intuition,
characterizes the</p>

that</p>
<p>can endure and grow long after he or she is gone.</p>

<p>The assumptions about environment, mission, and core competencies</p>
<p>must fit reality. When four penniless young men from Manchester,
England—</p>
<p>Simon Marks and his three brothers-in-law—decided in the early 1920s
that a</p>
<p>humdrum penny bazaar should become an agent of so-cial change, World
War</p>
<p>I had profoundly shaken their country’s class struc-ture. It had also
created</p>
<p>masses of new buyers for good-quality, stylish, and inexpensive
merchandise</p>
<p>such as lingerie, blouses, and stockings—Marks and Spencer’s
first</p>
<p>successful product categories. Marks and Spencer then systematically
set to</p>
<p>work developing brand-new and unheard-of core com-petencies. Until
then,</p>
<p>the core competency of a merchant was the ability to buy well. Marks
and</p>
<p>Spencer decided that it was the merchant, rather than the
manufacturer, who</p>
<p>knew the customer. Therefore, the merchant, not the manufacturer,
should</p>
<p>design the products, develop them, and find pro-ducers to make the
goods to</p>
<p>his design, specifications, and costs. This new definition of a

<p>successful, an organization tends increasingly to take its theory for

<p>Process analysis in an automobile company involves designing and

<p>components or services that create value for the customer. Each

<p>contributes to the quality of the automobile as well as to the cost.
A process</p>
<p>team is formed from personnel who perform the value-chain
activ-ities. This</p>
<p>team often includes suppliers and customers. The task of the team is
to</p>

<h3 id="exploiting-success">Exploiting Success</h3>
<p>Change leaders should starve problems and feed opportunities.</p>
<p>The first—and usually the best—opportunity for successful change is
to</p>
<p>exploit one’s own successes and to build on them. Problems cannot
be</p>
<p>ignored. And serious problems have to be taken care of. But to be
change</p>
<p>leaders, enterprises have to focus on opportunities. They have to
starve</p>
<p>problems and feed opportunities.</p>
<p>This requires a small but fundamental procedural change: an addi-</p>
<p>tional “first page” to the monthly report, one that should precede
the page</p>
<p>that shows the problems. It requires a page that focuses on where
results</p>
<p>are better than expected, whether in terms of sales, revenues,
profits, or</p>
<p>vol-ume. As much time then should be spent on this new first page as
has</p>
<p>tradi-tionally been spent on the problem page. Enterprises that
succeed in</p>
<p>being change leaders make sure that they staff the opportunities. The
way</p>
<p>to do this is to list the opportunities on one page and then to list
the</p>
<p>organiza-tion’s performing and capable people on another page. Then
one</p>
<p>allocates the ablest and most performing people to the top
opportunities.</p>
<p>The best example, perhaps, is the Japanese company Sony. It has
built</p>
<p>itself into one of the world’s leaders in a number of major
businesses by</p>
<p>systematically ex-ploiting one success after the other—big or

the</p>
<p>tellers at the branches on the simple, repetitive, routine services,
which</p>

<p>Successful entrepreneurs do not wait until the “the Muse kisses

<p>and gives them a bright idea; they go to work.</p>

innovative</p>
<p>opportunity. The first four sources lie within the enterprise,
whether business</p>
<p>or public-service institution, or within an industry or service
sec-tor. The</p>
<p>unexpected—the unexpected success, the unexpected failure, the
unexpected</p>
<p>outside event; the incongruity—between reality as it actually is and
reality as</p>
<p>it is assumed to be or as it “ought to be”; innovation based on
process need;</p>
<p>changes in industry structure or market structure that catch
everyone</p>
<p>unawares. The second set of sources for innovative opportunity
involves</p>
<p>changes outside the enterprise or industry: demographics
(popula-tion</p>
<p>changes); changes in perception, mood, and meaning; new
knowledge,</p>
<p>both scientific and nonscientific.</p>
<p>The lines between these seven source areas of innovative
opportunities</p>
<p>are blurred, and there is considerable overlap between them. They can
be</p>
<p>likened to seven windows, each on a different side of the same
building.</p>

<p>It takes an effort to perceive unexpected success as one’s own</p>

<p>It is precisely because the unexpected jolts us out of our
preconceived no-tions,</p>
<p>our assumptions, our certainties, that it is such a fertile source of
innovation. In</p>
<p>no other area are innovative opportunities less risky and their
pursuit less</p>
<p>arduous. Yet the unexpected success is almost totally ne-glected;
worse,</p>
<p>managements tend actively to reject it. One reason why it is
difficult for</p>
<p>management to accept unexpected success is that all of us tend to
believe that</p>
<p>anything that has lasted a fair amount of time must be “nor-</p>
<p>mal” and go on “forever.”</p>
<p>This explains why one of the major U.S. steel companies, around
1970,</p>
<p>rejected the “mini-mill.” Management knew that its steelworks were
rap-idly</p>
<p>becoming obsolete and would need billions of dollars of investment to
be</p>
<p>modernized. A new, smaller “mini-mill” was the solution. Almost by
ac-</p>
<p>cident, such a “mini-mill” was acquired. It soon began to grow
rapidly and to</p>
<p>generate cash and profits. Some of the younger people within the
steel</p>
<p>company proposed that available investment funds be used to acquire
ad-</p>
<p>ditional “mini-mills” and to build new ones. Top management
indignantly</p>
<p>vetoed the proposal. “The integrated steelmaking process is the only
right</p>
<p>one,” top management argued. “Everything else is cheating—a fad,
un-</p>
<p>healthy, and unlikely to endure.” Needless to say, thirty years later
the only</p>

proposition—they</p>
<p>may be buy-ing the same thing, but they are actually purchasing a
very</p>
<p>different value. For example, after the failure of the Edsel, Ford
decided</p>

<h3 id="incongruity">Incongruity</h3>
<p>The incongruity bespeaks an underlying “fault.”</p>
<p>There is often a discrepancy between “what is” and what
management</p>
<p>thinks “ought to be” that represents an incongruity within an
industry, a</p>
<p>market, and a process. The incongruity may be clearly visible to the
peo-</p>
<p>ple within or close to the industry, market, or process. Insiders may
notice</p>
<p>it but think, “this is the way it has always been,” as a reason for
not</p>
<p>initiating a change. Change leaders exploit these incongruities to
the</p>
<p>organization’s advantage.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the unequal information in the hands of buyers
and</p>
<p>sellers of automobiles. There are a few things about buying vehicles
most of</p>
<p>us dislike. These include haggling over price, misleading ads,
spending hours</p>
<p>at a dealership while the salesperson goes back and forth between the
sales</p>
<p>manager and us, and so on. Several online organizations have created
one-</p>
<p>stop shopping for used and new automobiles with complete and
accu-rate</p>
<p>information about vehicles of all types, including warranties,

<p>“Necessity is the mother of invention.”</p>
<p>The first two possibilities for innovation are opportunity driven.
But</p>
<p>the third is anchored in the old proverb, “Necessity is the mother of
in-</p>
<p>vention.” Here need is the source of innovation. I call it process
need.</p>
<p>Everybody in the organization always knows that the process need
exists.</p>
<p>Yet usually no one does anything about it. However, when the
innovation</p>
<p>appears, it is immediately accepted as “obvious” and soon becomes</p>
<p>“standard.”</p>
<p>Process innovation starts with the job to be done and requires the
pres-</p>
<p>ence of five basic criteria: a self-contained process, a weak or
missing</p>
<p>link, a clear definition of the objectives, clearly defined
specifications for</p>
<p>the so-lution, and widespread realization that there ought to be a
better</p>
<p>way. Take for example, O. M. Scott and Company, a leader among</p>
<p>American pro-ducers of lawn-care products. It gained its
leadership</p>
<p>position based upon a simple gadget called the spreader that users
can set</p>
<p>to evenly distribute proper quantities of lawn-care chemicals.
Without</p>
<p>such a tool there was an internal incongruity in the existing process
and</p>
<p>this incongruity frustrated consumers who were unable to evenly</p>
<p>distribute chemicals. There are now many such spreaders.</p>

<p>Industry and market structures appear so solid that the people in an

entrepreneurship from</p>

“What is our</p>

above all a</p>
<p>new, answer to that question. Large, dominant producers and
suppliers, having</p>
<p>been success-ful and unchallenged for many years, tend to be
arrogant. At first</p>
<p>they dis-miss the newcomer as insignificant and, indeed, amateurish.
But even</p>
<p>when the newcomer takes a larger and larger share of their business,
they</p>
<p>find it hard to mobilize themselves for counteraction.</p>
<p>For example, the U.S. Post Office did not react when UPS and
FedEx</p>

<p>Of all external changes, demographics—defined as changes in

status, and</p>

<p>Demographic shifts may be inherently unpredictable, yet they do
have</p>
<p>long lead times before impact, and lead times, moreover, that are

highest</p>
<p>predictive value changes in the center of population gravity, that
is, in the</p>
<p>age group that at any given time constitutes both the largest and
the</p>
<p>fastest-growing age cohort in the population. In the U.S. in the
1960s, this</p>
<p>was a shift to teenagers as the fastest-growing group. With these
shifts</p>
<p>came a change in what would be considered “representative”
behavior.</p>
<p>The teenagers of course continued to behave like teenagers. But that
was</p>

<p>In mathematics there is no difference between “the glass is half

For</p>

<p>In the theory and practice of innovation and entrepreneurship,</p>
<p>the bright-idea innovation belongs in the appendix.</p>
<p>New knowledge is not the most reliable or most predictable source
of</p>
<p>successful innovations. For all the visibility, glamour, and
importance of</p>
<p>science-based innovation, it is actually the least reliable and least
pre-</p>

of</p>
<p>any innovation. First, there is a long time span between the
emergence of</p>
<p>new knowledge, and it’s becoming applicable to technology. And
then</p>
<p>there is another long period before the new technology turns into</p>
<p>products, processes, or services in the marketplace.</p>
<p>The introduction of innovation creates excitement and attracts a host
of</p>
<p>competitors, meaning that innovators have to be right the first time.
They are</p>
<p>unlikely to get a second chance. Here, even successful innovators
al-most</p>
<p>immediately have far more company than they want and must
pre-pare</p>
<p>themselves to weather the storm that lies ahead. For example,
Apple</p>

<p>Institutions such as government agencies, labor unions, churches,
uni-versities</p>
<p>and schools, hospitals, community and charitable organiza-tions,
professional</p>
<p>and trade associations, and the like need to be entrepreneurial

<p>The rapid changes in today’s society, technology, and economy are
si-</p>
<p>multaneously an even greater threat to them and an even greater
opportu-nity.</p>
<p>Yet public-service institutions find it far more difficult to
innovate than even</p>
<p>the most “bureaucratic” company. The “existing” seems to be even more
of</p>
<p>an obstacle. To be sure, every service institution likes to get
bigger. In the</p>
<p>absence of a profit test, size is the one criterion of success for a
service</p>
<p>institution, and growth a goal in itself. And then, of course, there
is always so</p>
<p>much more that needs to be done. But stopping what has “always been
done”</p>
<p>and doing something new are equally anathema to service
institu-tions, or at</p>
<p>least excruciatingly painful to them. Most innovations in
public-service</p>

Institutions Need a Defined Mission</h3>
<p>We have attained what we were trying to do.</p>
<p>First, the public-service institution needs a clear definition of its
mission.</p>
<p>What is it trying to do? Why does it exist? It needs to focus on
objectives</p>
<p>rather than on programs and projects. Programs and projects are means
to an</p>
<p>end. They should always be considered as temporary and, in fact,
short-lived.</p>
<p>Second, the public-service institution needs a realistic statement of
goals. It</p>
<p>should say, “Our job is to assuage famine,” rather than, “Our job is
to</p>
<p>eliminate hunger.” It needs something that is genuinely attainable
and</p>
<p>therefore a commitment to a realistic goal, so that it can say
eventually, “Our</p>
<p>job is finished.” Most objectives can and should be phrased in
opti-mal rather</p>
<p>than in maximal terms. Then it is possible to say, “We have at-tained
what we</p>
<p>were trying to do.” Third, failure to achieve objectives should be
considered</p>
<p>an indication that the objective is wrong or at least de-fined
wrongly. If an</p>
<p>objective has not been attained after repeated tries, one has to
assume that it is</p>

<p>Market domination produces tremendous internal resistance</p>

<p>Amajor decision underlying marketing objectives is market
standing.</p>
<p>One common approach is to say, “We want to be the leader.” The other
one is</p>
<p>to say, “We don’t care what share of the market we have as long as
sales go</p>
<p>up.” Both sound plausible, but both are wrong. It does not do much
good for</p>
<p>a company’s sales to go up if it loses market share, that is, if the
market</p>
<p>expands much faster than the company’s sales do. A company with a
small</p>
<p>share of the market will eventually become marginal in the
marketplace, and</p>
<p>thereby exceedingly vulnerable. There is also a maxi-mum market
standing</p>
<p>above which it may be unwise to go—even if there were no antitrust
laws.</p>
<p>Market domination tends to lull the leader to sleep; monopolists
flounder on</p>
<p>their own complacency rather than on public op-position. Market
domination</p>
<p>produces tremendous internal resistance against any innovation and
thus</p>
<p>makes adaptation to change dangerously difficult. There is also
well-founded</p>
<p>resistance in the marketplace to de-pendence on one dominant
supplier. No</p>
<p>one likes to be at the mercy of the</p>
<p>monopoly supplier.</p>
<p>The market standing to aim at is not the maximum but the optimum.</p>
<p>This requires careful analysis of customers, of products or services,
of</p>
<p>mar-ket segments, and of distribution channels. It requires a
market</p>

<p>Maximum profitability and maximum profit flow are thus obtained by

<p>Why is the worship of high profit margin likely to damage—if not

<p>Of the top marketing lessons for the highly competitive twenty-first
cen-</p>
<p>tury, the most crucial one is that buying customers doesn’t work. The
collapse</p>
<p>of the Hyundai Excel was a spectacular marketing failure. There was
nothing</p>

result, it</p>

<p>or improvements to the car itself.</p>
<p>How to define the market is the second lesson—the lesson of what
was</p>
<p>both a marketing success and a major marketing fiasco: the conquest
of the</p>
<p>American market by the fax machine. The Japanese did not ask, “What
is the</p>
<p>market for this machine?” Instead they asked, “What is the market for
what it</p>
<p>does?” And they immediately saw, when looking at the growth of
courier</p>
<p>services such as Federal Express, that the market for the fax machine
had</p>
<p>already been established. The next lesson is that marketing starts
with all</p>

<p>“Consumerism” proves this. For what consumerism demands of

<p>Consumerism is the “shame of marketing.” Indeed, selling and
marketing</p>
<p>are antithetical rather than synonymous or even complementary.</p>

6 per-</p>

or six years</p>
<p>of trying, it also learned how to make sure that costs go down in the

Business</h3>
<p>How much business can we expect in this new company if we are</p>
<p>successful? And how much front-end investment is then justified?</p>
<p>To grow a business one has to put in front-end money. That money is
in-</p>
<p>vested in tomorrow’s profit makers, so those front-end investments
will only</p>
<p>be costs and no returns, and sometimes for a long time. How does
one</p>
<p>manage those to maintain cost control? The first thing is to budget
these ac-</p>
<p>tivities separately. I call it the opportunities budget. The second
rule, there-</p>
<p>fore, is to think through what results we expect from these
investments in</p>
<p>the future and within what time period.</p>
<p>The best example I know is how Citibank became the world’s only</p>
<p>suc-cessful transnational bank in the heady 1970s and 1980s. The
reason</p>
<p>was that Citi first thought through how much front-end investment in
a</p>
<p>new branch could be justified. It thought through what the
minimum</p>
<p>results in the new territory could and should be. Citibank asked:
“How</p>
<p>much busi-ness can we expect in this new country if we are
successful</p>
<p>and become a market leader? And how much front-end investment is
then</p>
<p>justified as-suming that the front-end investment must not exceed
a</p>
<p>certain percentage of the potential results?” And then Citi knew from
its</p>
<p>own experience how long it should take before this new branch
should</p>
<p>reach break-even, that is, before it should begin to produce
profits.</p>

<p>Would the roof cave in if we stopped doing this work altogether?</p>
<p>No matter how well a business prevents cost inflation, it will still
have to</p>
<p>cut costs. This is because businesses are like people, and people
often get sick</p>
<p>no matter how carefully they exercise, control their diet, and
avoid</p>
<p>substance abuse. There is thus always the need for cost cutting. To
start cost</p>
<p>cutting, management usually asks: “How can we make this operation
more</p>
<p>efficient?” It is the wrong question. The question should be: “Would
the roof</p>
<p>cave in if we stopped doing this work altogether?” And if the answer

how many</p>
<p>of the things we do will never be missed. But businesses that

<p>It depends heavily on accepting the premise that cost control is not

down,</p>
<p>so cost pre-vention is a never-ending task. No matter how well

<p>This process also ensures that the entire workforce embraces and

not a</p>
<p>threat. If cost control is seen as cost cutting, the workforce will
see it as a</p>

<p>“Shoemaker, stick to your last!”</p>
<p>The old cliché is still sound advice. The less diverse a business,
the more</p>
<p>manageable it is. Simplicity makes for clarity. People can understand
their</p>
<p>own job and see its relationship to results and to the performance of
the</p>
<p>whole. Efforts will tend to be concentrated. Expectations can be
de-fined, and</p>
<p>results can easily be appraised and measured. The less complex a

<p>the fewer things can go wrong. And the more complex a busi-ness is,
the</p>
<p>more difficult it is to figure out what went wrong and to take the

<p>Being the wrong size is a chronic, debilitating, wasting—and a
very</p>
<p>common—disease. Being the wrong size is curable in the majority of
cases.</p>
<p>But the cure is neither easy nor pleasant. The symptoms are clear and
are</p>
<p>always the same. In a business that is the wrong size, there is
always one</p>
<p>area, activity, function, or effort—or at most a very few—that is out
of all</p>
<p>proportion and hypertrophied. This area has to be so big, requires so
much</p>
<p>effort, and imposes so much cost on the business as to make
eco-nomic</p>
<p>performance and results impossible. The old American Motors
fur-nishes the</p>
<p>example. American Motors announced successive plans to
aggressively</p>
<p>recruit new and strong dealers and push up its sales. In order to
obtain the</p>
<p>sales volume that would have given the business a viable size, the
expenses</p>
<p>that made the business nonviable had to be increased. And</p>
<p>this is precisely what the business could not afford.</p>
<p>The most rewarding strategy to come to grips with the problem is
to</p>
<p>at-tempt to change the character of the business. A business that is
the</p>
<p>wrong size is a business that does not have the right niche to
survive and</p>
<p>prosper. A comparison between American Motors and Volkswagen
shows</p>
<p>the differ-ence between being the wrong size as a result of lack

niche.</p>

the</p>

earliest</p>
<p>“research managers,” the German-American physicist Charles
Pro-teus</p>
<p>Steinmetz. Steinmetz had two clear objectives from the start: to
orga-nize</p>
<p>science and scientific work for purposeful technological invention
and to</p>
<p>build continuous self-renewal through innovation into that new
so-</p>
<p>cial phenomenon—the big corporation.</p>
<p>Steinmetz’s lab radically redefined the relationship between
science</p>
<p>and technology in research. In setting the goals of his project,
Steinmetz</p>
<p>identified the new theoretical science needed to accomplish the
desired</p>
<p>technological results and then organized the appropriate “pure”
research</p>
<p>to obtain the needed new knowledge. Steinmetz himself was originally
a</p>
<p>theoretical physicist. But every one of his “contributions” was the
result</p>
<p>of research he had planned and specified as part of a project to
design and</p>
<p>to develop a new product line, for example, fractional horsepower
motors.</p>
<p>Technology, traditional wisdom held and still widely holds, is
“applied</p>
<p>sci-ence.” In Steinmetz’s lab, science—including the purest of “pure

<p>But this is the wrong focus for a new venture, or rather, it comes
last</p>
<p>rather than first. Cash flow, capital, and controls come much
earlier.</p>
<p>Without them, the profit figures are fiction—good for twelve to
eighteen</p>
<p>months, perhaps, after which they evaporate. Growth has to be fed.
In</p>
<p>financial terms this means that growth in a new venture demands
adding</p>
<p>financial resources rather than taking them out. The healthier a
new</p>
<p>venture and the faster it grows, the more financial feeding it
requires.</p>
<p>The new venture needs cash-flow analysis, cash-flow forecasts, and
cash</p>
<p>management. The fact that America’s new ventures of the last few
years (with</p>
<p>the significant exception of high-tech companies) have been doing so
much</p>
<p>better than new ventures used to do is largely because the new
entre-preneurs</p>
<p>in the United States have learned that entrepreneurship demands
financial</p>
<p>management. Cash management is fairly easy if there are reliable
cash-flow</p>
<p>forecasts, with “reliable” meaning “worst case” assumptions rather
than</p>
<p>hopes. If the forecast is overly conservative, the worst that can
happen is a</p>
<p>temporary cash surplus.</p>

what are</p>

<p>“Being Fustest with the Mostest.”</p>
<p>“First with the most” was the expression used by a Confederate
general to</p>
<p>describe his cavalry unit’s consistent victories in the Civil War. In
busi-ness, it</p>
<p>describes the strategy in which an innovator looks to attain
leader-ship, if not</p>
<p>outright dominance. This is the entrepreneurial strategy with the
potentially</p>
<p>highest rewards; but it’s also the most risky one. There can be no
mistakes or</p>
<p>second chances. The outcome is either market and in-dustry leadership
or</p>
<p>nothing at all. Entrepreneurs must be right the first time;
otherwise, they fail.</p>
<p>For every innovator that succeeds with this strat-egy, dozens fail.
Yet if the</p>
<p>“first with the most” strategy succeeds, the inno-vator reaps
tremendous</p>
<p>rewards. It’s the strategy that underlies the success and market
leadership of</p>
<p>such giants as 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Intel, and</p>
<p>Microsoft.</p>
<p>Yet there is a special risk to this strategy: to achieve initial
success,</p>
<p>then to be outflanked by someone practicing the next
entrepreneurial</p>
<p>strategy, “hitting them where they aren’t.” For example, the two
young</p>
<p>engineers who started the Apple computer company in the

<p>“Hitting them where they aren’t” outflanks the leader by creative

<p>Here, the innovator doesn’t create a major new product or service.
In-</p>
<p>stead, it takes something just created by somebody else and improves
upon it.</p>
<p>This is imitation. But it is creative imitation because the innovator
reworks</p>
<p>the new product or service to better satisfy customers’ wants and
needs. Once</p>
<p>the innovator succeeds in creating what customers want, it</p>
<p>can achieve leadership and take control of the market.</p>
<p>The perfect example is how IBM became the leading producer of PCs</p>
<p>in the 1970s. Apple invented the PC. When the Apple appeared, it was
an</p>
<p>instant sensation. IBM set to work to outflank the Apple. It asked,
“What</p>
<p>are Apple’s shortcomings?” Within eighteen months IBM had on the

<p>what the Apple lacked: software. And within another year IBM’s PC
had</p>
<p>become the market leader worldwide; it held that position for more
than</p>
<p>ten years. And Apple had become marginal. It almost went under and

<p>Successful innovators price according to what the customer pays
for.</p>
<p>Under the other entrepreneurial strategies, the innovator has to come
up</p>
<p>with an innovative product or service; here the strategy itself is
the</p>
<p>innovation. The innovative strategy converts an existing product or
service</p>
<p>into something new by changing its utility, its value, and its
economic</p>
<p>characteristics. There is new economic value and new customers, but
no new</p>
<p>product or service. Often the most successful way to change the
eco-nomic</p>
<p>characteristics of a product or service is to change its pricing. In
the end the</p>
<p>producer gets at least the same amount of money, if not a good deal
more. But</p>
<p>the way pricing is structured reflects the customer’s reality
rather</p>
<p>than the reality of the producer.</p>
<p>Here is an example. The Internet was designed as an information
net-</p>
<p>work. And most providers charged for access to it, such as for
hosting an</p>
<p>e-mail address. But Yahoo and other companies give away Internet</p>
<p>access. It gets paid for by advertisers whose ads the customers have
to see</p>
<p>when they go online. Yahoo asked: “Who is the customer?” Its
answer:</p>
<p>“It’s a sup-plier who wants access to a potential customer.” This

<h3 id="ecological-niche-tollbooth-strategy">Ecological Niche: Tollbooth
Strategy</h3>
<p>If the innovator succeeds, it will have a nearly impenetrable
position.</p>
<p>The fourth major entrepreneurial strategy, occupying an ecological
niche,</p>
<p>allows an innovator to establish a virtual monopoly in a small niche
market.</p>
<p>The first niche strategy is the tollbooth strategy. Under the
tollbooth strategy,</p>
<p>the innovator creates a product or service that is an in-dispensable
part of a</p>
<p>larger process. Then the cost of using the product be-comes
eventually</p>
<p>irrelevant. Here the market must be so limited that whoever occupies
the</p>
<p>niche first is able to effectively bar anyone else from</p>
<p>entering it.</p>
<p>Here is an example: Alcon, a company started in the late 1950s by
a</p>
<p>salesman for a major pharmaceutical company. He had known all
along</p>
<p>that there was a major incongruity in the operation for senile
cataracts in</p>
<p>the eyes. There was one dangerous procedure in the surgery where
the</p>
<p>sur-geon had to sever a piece of muscle tissue with a slight risk
of</p>
<p>bleeding that would destroy the eye. The innovator read up on what
was</p>
<p>known about this muscle and found almost immediately that an
enzyme</p>
<p>dissolved it without bleeding or cutting. But there had been no way
to</p>
<p>prevent this en-zyme from disintegrating and to give it shelf life.
Then the</p>
<p>innovator found that since 1890 a number of substances had been</p>
<p>developed to give en-zymes stability and shelf life. He patented
the</p>
<p>application of one of these substances to the enzyme, and within
eighteen</p>
<p>months he had the world market for the stuff.</p>

<h3 id="ecological-niche-specialty-skill-strategy">Ecological Niche:
Specialty-Skill Strategy</h3>
<p>If the specialty skill is properly maintained the innovator</p>
<p>is usually protected against competition.</p>
<p>The second ecological niche is the specialty-skill strategy. Here the
niche</p>
<p>an innovator occupies is just as unique as in the tollbooth
strat-egy, but it</p>
<p>tends to be somewhat larger. For example, everyone can name the major
U.S.</p>
<p>automobile manufacturers. But how many people know the companies
that</p>
<p>make the brake pads or electrical circuits or headlamps that go into
these</p>
<p>cars? Those largely unknown companies occupy a specialty-skill
position in</p>
<p>an ecological niche. Developing high skill at a very early time in a
new</p>
<p>industry or market captures this position. Once the market begins to
grow, the</p>
<p>innovator has a significant head start over potential</p>
<p>competitors and has already become the standard industry
supplier.</p>
<p>The best example is that of America’s leading twentieth-century
inven-tor,</p>
<p>Charles Kettering. Kettering aimed in all his inventions at creating
a vastly</p>
<p>profitable niche business. And his first, and probably the world’s
most</p>
<p>profitable invention, was aimed at creating a specialty-skill niche
market. It</p>
<p>was the self-starter. Until then, automobiles had to be started by
cranking by</p>
<p>hand, which was very hard and also quite dangerous. But for fifteen
years or</p>
<p>so, during the period of the most rapid growth in the automobile
industry,</p>
<p>every carmaker had to buy Kettering’s self-starter. It added very
lit-tle to the</p>
<p>cost of the car, maybe 1 or 2 percent. But Kettering’s profit
mar-gins were</p>
<p>known to be around 500 percent or more.</p>

<h3 id="ecological-niche-specialty-market">Ecological Niche: Specialty

<p>With the specialty-market strategy the innovator must create</p>

<p>The final niche strategy is to establish a specialty-market niche big
enough</p>
<p>to be profitable but small enough not to make it worthwhile for
potential</p>
<p>competitors to invade it. For example, the most profitable fi-</p>
<p>nancial product for twenty or more years, from 1919 until World War
II</p>
<p>and even a decade beyond, was the American Express Travelers
Cheque</p>
<p>—a specialty-market niche. The Travelers Cheque was much safer
than</p>
<p>carry-ing a lot of cash and usable everywhere—they were accepted,
for</p>
<p>instance, by every European hotel. Banks sold the Cheques and got
a</p>
<p>small fee for each transaction. This not only kept American Express
from</p>
<p>needing to market the Cheques, but it also discouraged the banks
from</p>
<p>launching a competing service. And American Express made oodles
of</p>
<p>money because Cheque owners would hold the Cheques for months, or</p>
<p>even years, before cashing them, during which time American
Express</p>
<p>had the “float,” that is, the interest-free use of the money the
Cheque</p>
<p>holders had paid. Everyone in the financial industry knew how
profitable</p>
<p>the Travelers Cheques were. But the market then was so small that
there</p>

<p>What all niche strategies have in common is that they are unlikely
to</p>
<p>endure forever. One threat is for the niche to be outflanked, and
es-pecially by</p>
<p>technological change. That happened to Alcon. Fifteen years after it
became a</p>
<p>worldwide near-monopoly, somebody in Czechoslovakia invented a
new</p>
<p>cataract operation, the implant lens, in which eye muscle has to be
maintained</p>
<p>rather than dissolved. And Alcon’s solvent became</p>
<p>history.</p>
<p>Another threat is if a niche becomes the main mass market. That’s
what</p>
<p>happened to the Travelers Cheque. Before World War II, a European
trip for</p>
<p>Americans was still the rare exception. Now the transatlantic jets
carry more</p>
<p>passengers in two days between Europe and the U.S. than all the
steamships</p>
<p>carried in an entire year before World War II. And the new mass
traveler uses</p>
<p>a credit card. And when the automobile market became a mass market,
in the</p>
<p>U.S. during World War I and in Europe and Japan after World War II,
the</p>
<p>intense pressure to cut costs meant that to be the niche supplier
depending on</p>
<p>a specialty skill ceased to yield niche profits. These players were
the ones,</p>

<p>The strategy of Baker Company is completely different. Its research
lab,</p>
<p>perhaps the most famous in the pharmaceutical industry, works in
an</p>
<p>enormous number of fields. It does not, however, enter a field until
the basic</p>
<p>scientific theoretical work has been done. Then it goes to work. Of
every ten</p>
<p>products that come out of its own laboratory, the company itself
markets no</p>
<p>more than two or three. When it becomes reasonably clear that an
effective</p>
<p>drug will result from a line of research, the company carefully
scrutinizes the</p>
<p>product and, indeed, the entire field. First, is the new prod-uct
likely to be</p>
<p>medically so superior as to become the new “standard”? Second, is it
likely to</p>
<p>have major impact throughout the field of health care and medical
practice</p>
<p>rather than be confined to one specialty area, even a large one? And
finally, is</p>
<p>it likely to remain the “standard” for a good many</p>
<p>years, rather than to be overtaken by competitive products?</p>
<p>If the answer to any of these three questions is “No,” the company
will</p>
<p>license or sell the development, rather than convert it into a
product of its</p>
<p>own. This has been highly profitable in two ways. It has generated
licensing</p>
<p>income almost equal to the profits the company makes on the drugs it
makes</p>
<p>and sells under its own name. And it has assured that each of the
company’s</p>
<p>products is considered the “leader” by the medical profession.</p>

<p>Charlie Company does no research. All it does is develop. It will
not</p>
<p>tackle any of the products Able or Baker companies consider
attrac-tive. It</p>
<p>looks for areas in medical and surgical practice where existing
prod-ucts are</p>
<p>not doing a good job, and where a fairly simple change can greatly
improve</p>
<p>the doctor’s or surgeon’s performance. And it looks for fields that
are so small</p>
<p>that once there is a truly superior product, there is no
incentive</p>
<p>for anyone else to go in and compete.</p>
<p>Its first product was a simple enzyme—actually known for forty

<p>— to make cataract operations virtually bloodless and greatly ease
the eye</p>
<p>surgeon’s job. All the work that had to be done was to find a way
to</p>
<p>extend the shelf life of the enzyme. The next product was a very
simple</p>
<p>ointment to put on the umbilical cord of infants to prevent infection
and</p>
<p>speed up healing. It has become standard in every maternity
hospital</p>
<p>throughout the world. The company later brought out a product to
replace</p>
<p>the toxic solu-tion with which newborn babies used to be washed
to</p>
<p>prevent infection— again, primarily a matter of compounding rather
than</p>
<p>discovering. In each area, the world market is so limited—maybe to
$20</p>

ask,</p>
<p>“What is our business?” Everybody in the company thinks that the

<p>so obvious as not to deserve discussion. It is never popular to argue
with</p>
<p>success, never popular to rock the boat. But the management that does
not ask</p>
<p>“What is our business?” when the company is successful is, in effect,
smug,</p>
<p>lazy, and arrogant. It will not be long before success will turn
into</p>
<p>failure.</p>
<p>The two most successful American industries of the 1920s were an-</p>

them an</p>

for</p>
<p>granted. Above all: when a management attains the company’s

<p>Effective executives start with their time.</p>
<p>“Know thyself,” the old prescription for wisdom, is almost impossibly
dif-</p>
<p>ficult for mortal men. But everyone can follow the injunction “Know
thy time”</p>
<p>if one wants to, and be well on the road toward contribution and</p>
<p>effectiveness.</p>
<p>Most discussions of the executive’s task start with the advice to
plan</p>
<p>one’s work. This sounds eminently plausible. The only thing wrong
with</p>
<p>it is that it rarely works. The plans always remain on paper,
always</p>
<p>remain good intentions. They seldom turn into achievement.
Effective</p>
<p>executives, in my observation, do not start with their tasks. They
start</p>
<p>with their time. And they do not start out with planning. They start
by</p>
<p>finding out where their time actually goes. Then they attempt to
manage</p>
<p>their time and to cut back unproductive demands on their time.
Finally</p>
<p>they consolidate their “discretionary” time into the largest

<p>There are executives who keep such a time log themselves. Others have
their</p>
<p>secretaries do it for them. The important thing is that it gets done,
and that the</p>
<p>record is made in “real” time. A good many effective ex-ecutives keep
such a</p>
<p>log continuously and look at it regularly every month. After each
such</p>
<p>sample, they rethink and rework their schedule. First one tries to
identify and</p>
<p>eliminate the things that need not be done at all, the things that
are purely a</p>
<p>waste of time without any results whatever. To find these time
wasters, one</p>
<p>asks of all activities in the time records: “What would happen if
this were not</p>

<h3 id="consolidate-time">Consolidate Time</h3>
<p>Effective executives know that one rarely overprunes.</p>
<p>The final step in time management is to consolidate the time that
record</p>
<p>and analysis show as normally available and under the execu-tive’s
control.</p>
<p>To be effective every executive needs to be able to dispose of time
in fairly</p>
<p>large chunks. This is particularly true with respect to time spent
working with</p>
<p>people, which is, of course, a central task in the work of the
executive. The</p>
<p>manager who thinks that she can discuss the plans, di-rection,
and</p>
<p>performance of one of her subordinates in fifteen minutes is</p>
<p>just deceiving herself.</p>
<p>There are a good many ways to consolidate time. Some people work
at</p>
<p>home one or more days a week. Other executives schedule all the
operat-ing</p>
<p>work—the meetings, reviews, problem-sessions, and so on—for two days
a</p>
<p>week and set aside the mornings of the remaining days for
consistent,</p>
<p>continuing work on major issues. But the method by which one
consoli-dates</p>
<p>one’s discretionary time is far less important than the approach.
Ef-fective</p>
<p>executives start out by estimating how much discretionary time they
can</p>
<p>realistically call their own. And if they find later that other
matters en-croach</p>
<p>on this reserve, they scrutinize their record again and get rid of
some more</p>

Executives</h3>
<p>All that effective executives have in common is the ability</p>

<p>The effective executives I have seen differ widely in their
temperaments</p>
<p>and abilities, in what they do and how they do it, in their
personalities, their</p>
<p>knowledge, their interests—in fact, in almost everything that
distin-guishes</p>
<p>human beings. But all effective executives I’ve known perform
only</p>
<p>necessary tasks and eliminate unnecessary ones.</p>
<p>Five practices have to be acquired to be effective. Effective
executives</p>
<p>know where their time goes. They work systematically at managing
the</p>
<p>little of their time that can be brought under their control.
Effective</p>
<p>executives focus on outward contributions. Effective executives build
on</p>
<p>strengths— theirs and others. They do not build on weaknesses.
Effective</p>
<p>executives concentrate on superior performance where superior</p>
<p>performance will pro-duce outstanding results. They force themselves
to</p>
<p>stay within priorities. Effective executives make effective
decisions. They</p>
<p>know that this is a sys-tem—the right steps in the right sequence.
They</p>
<p>know that to make deci-sions fast is to make the wrong decisions.</p>
<p>Whenever I have found a person who—no matter how great in</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-contribution">Focus on Contribution</h3>
<p>The question “What should I contribute?” gives freedom because</p>
<p>it gives responsibility.</p>
<p>The great majority of executives tend to focus downward. They are
oc-</p>
<p>cupied with efforts rather than with results. They worry over what
the</p>
<p>organization and their superiors “owe” them and should do for them.
And</p>
<p>they are conscious above all of the authority they “should have.” As
a result,</p>
<p>they render themselves ineffectual. The effective executive focuses
on con-</p>
<p>tribution. He looks up from his work and outward toward goals. He
asks:</p>
<p>“What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance
and</p>
<p>the results of the institution I serve?” His stress is on
responsibility.</p>
<p>The focus on contribution is the key to effectiveness: in a person’s
own</p>
<p>work—its content, its level, its standards, and its impacts; in his
relations</p>
<p>with others—his superiors, his associates, his subordinates; in his
use of</p>
<p>the tools of the executive such as meetings or reports. The focus
on</p>
<p>contribu-tion turns the executive’s attention away from his own
specialty,</p>
<p>his own narrow skills, his own department, and toward the
performance</p>
<p>of the whole. It turns his attention to the outside, the only place
where</p>
<p>there are results.</p>

<h3 id="performance-appraisals">Performance Appraisals</h3>
<p>Appraisals—and the philosophy behind them—are far too</p>
<p>much concerned with “potential.”</p>
<p>Effective executives usually work out their own unique form of
perfor-</p>
<p>mance appraisal. It starts out with a statement of the major
contribu-tions</p>
<p>expected from a person in his past and present positions and a
record</p>
<p>of his performance against these goals. Then it asks four
questions:</p>
<p>What has he [or she] done well?</p>
<p>What, therefore, is he likely to be able to do well?</p>
<p>What does he have to learn or to acquire to be able to get the</p>
<p>full benefit from his strength?</p>
<p>If I had a son or daughter, would I be willing to have him or</p>
<p>her work under this person?</p>
<p>a.If yes, why?</p>
<p>b.If no, why?</p>
<p>This appraisal actually takes a much more critical look at a person
than the</p>
<p>usual procedure does. But it focuses on strengths. Weaknesses are
seen as</p>
<p>limitations to the full use of strengths and to one’s own
achievement, ef-</p>
<p>fectiveness, and accomplishment. The last question (b.) is the only
one that is</p>
<p>not primarily concerned with strengths. Subordinates, especially
bright,</p>
<p>young, and ambitious ones, tend to mold themselves after a forceful
boss.</p>
<p>There is, therefore, nothing more corrupting and more destructive in
an</p>
<p>organization than a forceful but basically corrupt executive. Here,
therefore,</p>
<p>is the one area where weakness is a disqualification by itself rather
than a</p>
<p>limitation on performance capacity and strength.</p>

<p>Any organization develops people; it either forms them or deforms

<p>Any organization develops people; it has no choice. It either helps
them grow</p>
<p>or it stunts them. What do we know about developing people?</p>
<p>Quite a bit. We certainly know what not to do, and those don’ts are
easier</p>
<p>to spell out than the dos. First, one does not try to build upon
people’s</p>
<p>weak-ness. One can expect adults to develop manners and behavior
and</p>
<p>to learn skills and knowledge. But one has to use people’s
personalities</p>
<p>the way they are, not the way we would like them to be. A second
don’t is</p>
<p>to take a nar-row and shortsighted view of the development of
people.</p>
<p>One has to learn specific skills for a specific job. But development
is</p>
<p>more than that: it has to be for a career and for a life. The
specific job</p>
<p>must fit into this longer-term goal. Another thing we know is not
to</p>
<p>establish crown princes. Look always at performance, not at
promise.</p>
<p>With the focus on performance and not po-tential, the executive can
make</p>
<p>high demands. One can always relax stan-dards, but one can never
raise</p>
<p>them. Next, the executive must learn to place people’s strengths.</p>
<p>In developing people the lesson is to focus on strengths. Then make
re-</p>
<p>ally stringent demands, and take the time and trouble (it’s hard
work) to</p>
<p>re-view performance. Sit down with people and say: “This is what
you</p>

<h3 id="defining-ones-performance">Defining One’s Performance</h3>
<p>Performance is not hitting the bull’s-eye with every shot—</p>
<p>that is a circus act.</p>
<p>The first requirement of organizational health is a high demand on
per-</p>
<p>formance. Indeed, one of the major reasons for demanding that
man-agement</p>
<p>be by objectives and that it focus on the objective requirements of
the task is</p>
<p>the need to have managers set high standards of performance for
themselves.</p>
<p>This requires that performance be understood properly. Per-formance
is not</p>
<p>hitting the bull’s-eye with every shot. Performance is rather the
consistent</p>
<p>ability to produce results over prolonged periods of time and in a
variety of</p>
<p>assignments. A performance record must include mistakes. It must
include</p>
<p>failures. It must reveal a person’s limitations as well as his</p>
<p>strengths.</p>
<p>The one person to distrust is the one who never makes a mistake,
never</p>
<p>commits a blunder, never fails in what he tries to do. Either he is a
phony,</p>
<p>or he stays with the safe, the tried, and the trivial. The better a
person is,</p>
<p>the more mistakes he will make—for the more new things he will
try.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-253">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Define performance as a “batting average.” Create an</p>
<p>atmosphere where people are permitted to make mistakes. Evaluate
a</p>
<p>person’s performance as “the consistent ability to produce results
over a</p>
<p>rel-atively long period of time.”</p>

<h3 id="results-that-make-a-difference">Results That Make a
Difference</h3>
<p>What results have to be achieved to make a difference?</p>
<p>One question has to be asked to decide “What should I
contribute?”</p>
<p>“Where and how can I have results that make a difference?” The
an-swer</p>
<p>to this question has to balance a number of things. Results should be
hard</p>
<p>to achieve. They should require “stretching,” to use the present
buzz-</p>
<p>word. But they should be within reach. To aim at results that cannot
be</p>
<p>achieved—or can be achieved only under the most unlikely circum-</p>
<p>stances—is not being “ambitious.” It is being foolish. At the same
time,</p>
<p>re-sults should be meaningful. They should make a difference. And
they</p>
<p>should be visible and, if at all possible, measurable.</p>
<p>The decision about “What should my contribution be?” balances
three</p>
<p>elements. First comes the question: “What does the situation
require?”</p>
<p>Then comes the question: “How could I make the greatest
contribution,</p>
<p>with my strengths, my way of performing, my values, to what needs to
be</p>
<p>done?” Finally, there is the question: “What results have to be
achieved to</p>
<p>make a difference?” This then leads to the action conclusions: what
to do,</p>
<p>where to start, how to start, what goals and deadlines to set.</p>

<h3 id="managing-oneself-identify-strengths">Managing Oneself: Identify
Strengths</h3>
<p>It takes far less energy to move from first-rate performance to
excellence</p>
<p>than it does to move from incompetence to mediocrity.</p>
<p>You can learn to identify your strengths by using feedback analysis.
This</p>
<p>is a simple process in which you write down every one of your key
de-cisions</p>
<p>and key actions along with the results that you expect them to
achieve. Nine</p>
<p>to twelve months later, check the actual results against
ex-pectations. After</p>
<p>two to three years of use, you will know your strengths by tracking
those</p>
<p>decisions and actions where actual results fell in line with or
exceeded</p>
<p>expectations. Once you have identified your strengths through
feedback</p>
<p>analysis, you can use this knowledge to improve performance and</p>
<p>results. You can make this happen in five ways.</p>
<p>First, concentrate on your strengths. Second, work on improving</p>
<p>strengths. You may need to learn new knowledge or to update old.
Third,</p>
<p>recognize disabling habits. The worst, and most common, one is
arro-</p>
<p>gance. Oftentimes poor performance results from an unwillingness to
pur-</p>
<p>sue knowledge outside one’s own narrow specialty. Fourth, remedy
bad</p>
<p>habits and bad manners. All too often, a bad habit such as
procrastination</p>
<p>or bad manners makes cooperation and teamwork all but impossible.
And</p>
<p>fifth, figure out what you should not do.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-255">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Use feedback analysis to identify your strengths. Then go</p>
<p>to work on improving your strengths. Identify and eliminate bad
habits</p>
<p>that hinder the full development of your strengths. Figure out what
you</p>
<p>should do and do it. Finally, decide what you should not do.</p>

<p>Performance that violates your values corrupts,</p>

<p>Just as different people have different strengths and weaknesses,
they also</p>
<p>work and perform in different ways. For example, some people learn by
reading,</p>
<p>others by listening. And few readers can become successful listen-ers
or vice</p>
<p>versa. Learning style is just one of several factors that go into
making up a</p>
<p>person’s work style. There are other questions that must be
an-swered. Do you</p>
<p>work best when cooperating with others, or do you achieve results
when working</p>
<p>alone? If you work best with others, is it usually as a subordinate,
peer, or</p>
<p>supervisor? Do you need a predictable, structured</p>
<p>work environment? Do you thrive under pressure?</p>
<p>You also have to consider your personal values: are they comparable
to</p>
<p>or at least compatible with your strengths? If there is any conflict
between</p>
<p>your values and strengths, always choose values. Performance that</p>
<p>violates your values corrupts, and it will ultimately sap and destroy
your</p>

<p>What to do with the second half of one’s life?</p>
<p>Knowledge workers are able physically to keep on working into old
age, and</p>
<p>well beyond any traditional retirement age. But they run a new</p>
<p>risk: they may become mentally finished. What’s commonly called</p>
<p>“burnout,” the most common affliction of the fortysomething
knowledge</p>

common,</p>
<p>cause is boredom on the job.</p>
<p>In one big and highly successful company top management said to
me:</p>
<p>“Our engineers are slacking off. Can you try to find out why?” And so
I</p>
<p>talked to about a dozen very competent, very successful, very well

<p>Managing oneself is based on these realities: Workers are likely

<p>Managing oneself is a REVOLUTION in human affairs. It requires
new</p>
<p>and unprecedented things from the individual, and especially from
the</p>
<p>knowledge worker. For, in effect, it demands that each knowledge</p>
<p>worker think and behave as a chief executive officer. It also
requires an</p>
<p>al-most 180-degree change in the knowledge workers’ thoughts and</p>
<p>actions from what most of us still take for granted as the way to
think and</p>
<p>the way to act.</p>

granted, if</p>
<p>only sub-consciously: Organizations outlive workers, and most
people</p>
<p>stay put. Managing oneself is based on the very opposite realities.

<p>A.widow-maker position is a job that defeats</p>
<p>two competent people in a row.</p>
<p>“Widow-maker” is the term that nineteenth-century New England</p>
<p>shipbuilders used to describe a well-built new ship that still
man-aged to have</p>
<p>two fatal accidents in a row. Instead of attempting to fix the</p>
<p>problems with the ship, they immediately broke it up to prevent
another</p>
<p>ac-cident from occurring. In organizations, a widow-maker is a job
that</p>
<p>defeats two competent people in a row. It will almost certainly
defeat a</p>
<p>third one, no matter how competent. The only thing to do is to
abolish the</p>
<p>widow-maker position and restructure the work. Widow-makers
typically</p>
<p>appear when an organization experiences rapid growth or rapid change.
I</p>
<p>have since seen this phenomenon in a lot of organizations—for
example,</p>
<p>in a university that within ten years had moved from being primarily
an</p>
<p>under-graduate teaching institution to becoming a major research</p>
<p>university. That killed off two excellent people who took on the</p>
<p>presidency as it had been structured the old way, and by the way,
any</p>
<p>number of deans—again, these positions could be filled successfully
only</p>
<p>after the university had re-structured itself thoroughly.</p>
<p>The “widow-maker” job is usually the result of accident. One
person</p>
<p>who somehow combined temperamental characteristics that are not
usu-</p>
<p>ally found in one person created the job and acquitted himself or
herself</p>
<p>well. In other words, what looked like a logical job was an accident

<p>The probability of an event’s being meaningful</p>

<p>We are rapidly acquiring great capacity to design controls in
business</p>

techniques,</p>

very fast.</p>
<p>What does this mean for “control”? Especially, what are the
requirements for</p>
<p>these greatly improved controls to give better control to management?
For, in</p>
<p>the task of a manager, controls are purely a means to an end; the end
is</p>
<p>control. If we deal with a human being in a social insti-tution,
controls must</p>

required</p>
<p>before the information yielded by the controls can become grounds for
action</p>
<p>—the translation of one kind of information into another, which we
call</p>
<p>perception. In the social institution there is a second complexity, a

<h3 id="controls-neither-objective-nor-neutral">Controls: Neither
Objective nor Neutral</h3>
<p>The act of measurement changes both the event and the observer.</p>
<p>In any social situation of the kind we deal with in enterprise, the
act of</p>
<p>measurement is neither objective nor neutral. It is subjective and of
ne-cessity</p>
<p>biased. It changes both the event and the observer. Events in the
so-cial situation</p>
<p>acquire value by the fact that they are being singled out for the
attention of being</p>
<p>measured. The fact that this or that set of phenomena is singled out
for being</p>
<p>“controlled” signals that it is considered to be impor-tant. Controls
in a social</p>
<p>institution such as a business are goal-setting and value-setting.
They are not</p>
<p>“objective.” They are of necessity moral. Con-trols create vision.
They change</p>
<p>both the events measured and the ob-server. They endow events not
only with</p>
<p>meaning but with value. And this means that the basic question is not
“How do</p>
<p>we control?” but “What do we</p>
<p>measure in our control system?”</p>
<h3 id="action-point-267">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Remember, “What you measure is what you get.” Ensure</p>
<p>that every measure of performance is pertinent to the achievement of
a</p>

<p>What today’s organization needs are synthetic sense organs for the
outside.</p>
<p>Every social institution exists to contribute to society, economy,
and in-</p>
<p>dividual. In consequence results exist only on the outside—in
econ-omy, in</p>
<p>society, and with the customer. It is the customer only who creates a
profit.</p>
<p>Everything inside a business creates only costs, is only a “cost
cen-ter.” But</p>
<p>results are entrepreneurial. Yet we do not have adequate, let alone
reliable,</p>
<p>information regarding the “outside.” The century of patient analy-sis
of</p>
<p>managerial, inside phenomena, events and data, the century of
pa-tient,</p>
<p>skillful work on the individual operations and tasks within the
business, has</p>
<p>no counterpart with respect to the entrepreneurial job. We can easily
record</p>
<p>and therefore quantify efficiency, that is, efforts. It is of lit-tle
value to have</p>
<p>the most efficient engineering department if it designs the wrong
product.</p>
<p>And it mattered little, I daresay, during the period of IBM’s great
expansion</p>
<p>in the fifties and sixties how “efficient” its operations were;</p>
<p>its basic entrepreneurial idea was the right, the effective one.</p>
<p>The outside, the area of results, is much less accessible than the
inside.</p>
<p>The central problem of executives in the large organization is their
insula-</p>
<p>tion from the outside. What today’s organization therefore needs are
syn-</p>

<p>A balance between the measurable and the nonmeasurable is a
central</p>
<p>and constant problem of management.</p>
<p>Business, like any other institution, has important results that
are</p>
<p>inca-pable of being measured. Any experienced executive knows
compa-</p>
<p>nies or industries that are bound for extinction because they cannot
attract</p>
<p>or hold able people. This, every experienced executive also knows, is
a</p>
<p>more important fact about a company or an industry than last year’s
profit</p>
<p>statement. Yet the statement cannot be defined clearly let alone
“quanti-</p>
<p>fied.” It is anything but “intangible”; it is very “tangible” indeed.
It is just</p>
<p>nonmeasurable. And measurable results will not show up for a
decade.</p>
<p>A balance between the measurable and the nonmeasurable is therefore
a</p>
<p>central and constant problem of management and a true decision
area.</p>
<p>Measurements that do not spell out the assumptions with respect to
the</p>
<p>nonmeasurable statements that are being made—misdirect, therefore.
They</p>
<p>actually misinform. Yet the more we can quantify the truly
measura-ble areas,</p>
<p>the greater the temptation to put all-out emphasis on those—the

<h3 id="the-ultimate-control-of-organizations">The Ultimate Control of
Organizations</h3>
<p>People act as they are being rewarded or punished.</p>
<p>There is a fundamental, incurable, basic limitation to controls in a
so-cial</p>
<p>institution. A social institution is comprised of persons, each with
his own</p>
<p>purpose, his own ambitions, his own ideas, his own needs. No mat-</p>
<p>ter how authoritarian the institution, it has to satisfy the
ambitions and</p>
<p>needs of its members, and do so in their capacity as individuals
through</p>
<p>in-stitutional rewards and punishments, incentives, and deterrents.
The</p>
<p>ex-pression of this may be quantifiable—such as a raise in salary.
But the</p>
<p>system itself is not quantitative in character and cannot be
quantified.</p>
<p>Yet here is the real control of the institution. People act as they
are being</p>
<p>rewarded or punished. For this, to them, rightly, is the true
expression of the</p>
<p>values of the institution and of its true, as against its professed,
purpose and</p>
<p>role. A system of controls that is not in conformity with this
ultimate control</p>
<p>of the organization, which lies in its people decisions, will
therefore at best be</p>
<p>ineffectual. At worst it will cause never-ending conflict and will
push the</p>
<p>organization out of control. In designing controls for an
organiza-tion, one</p>
<p>has to understand and analyze the actual control of the business, its
people</p>
<p>decisions. One has to realize that even the most powerful
“in-strument board”</p>
<p>complete with computers is secondary to the invisible, qualitative
control of</p>
<p>any human organization, its systems of rewards and punishments, of
values</p>
<p>and taboos.</p>

sacrifice</p>

<p>If a manager does not take care of the next hundred days, there will

where he</p>
<p>cannot harmonize the two time dimensions, he must at least balance
them. He</p>

makes today</p>

<p>People have to be paid, but every compensation system is liable to

<p>in society. It entails judgments on a person’s worth as much as
on</p>
<p>performance. It is emotionally tied to all our ideas of fairness,
justice, and</p>
<p>equity. Money is, of course, quantitative. But the money in any
compensa-</p>
<p>tion system expresses the most intangible, but also the most
sensitive, val-ues</p>
<p>and qualities. No attempt at a “scientific formula” for
compensation</p>

<p>The best possible compensation plan is of necessity a compromise</p>

<p>A decision, to be effective, needs to satisfy the boundary
conditions.</p>
<p>Adecision process requires clear specifications as to what the
decision has to</p>
<p>accomplish. What are the objectives the decision has to reach?</p>
<p>In science these are known as “boundary conditions.” A decision, to
be</p>
<p>ef-fective, needs to be adequate to its purpose. The more concisely
and</p>
<p>clearly boundary conditions are stated, the greater the likelihood
that the</p>
<p>decision will indeed be an effective one and will accomplish what it
set</p>
<p>out to do. Conversely, any serious shortfall in defining these
boundary</p>
<p>conditions is almost certain to make a decision ineffectual, no
matter how</p>
<p>brilliant it may seem.</p>
<p>“What is the minimum needed to resolve this problem?” is the form
in</p>
<p>which the boundary conditions are usually probed. “Can our needs be
sat-</p>
<p>isfied,” Alfred P. Sloan presumably asked himself when he took</p>
<p>command of General Motors in 1922, “by removing the autonomy of
the</p>
<p>division heads?” His answer was clearly in the negative. The
boundary</p>
<p>conditions of his problem demanded strength and responsibility in
the</p>
<p>chief operating positions. This was needed as much as control at
the</p>
<p>center and unity. The boundary conditions demanded a solution to
a</p>
<p>problem of structure, rather than an accommodation among
personalities.</p>

Half a</p>

<p>Adecision is a commitment to action. Until the right thing happens,
there</p>

<p>A decision will not become effective unless needed actions have

<p>The action must be appropriate to the capacities of the people who

<p>The effective decision-maker organizes dissent.</p>
<p>Decisions of the kind the executive has to make are not made well

<p>acclamation. They are made well only if based on the clash of
con-flicting</p>
<p>views, the dialogue between different points of view, the choice
be-tween</p>
<p>different judgments. The first rule in decision making is that
one</p>
<p>does not make a decision unless there is disagreement.</p>
<p>Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., is reported to have said at a meeting of one of
the GM</p>
<p>top committees, “Gentlemen, I take it we are all in complete
agree-ment on</p>
<p>the decision here.” Everyone around the table nodded assent.
“Then,”</p>
<p>continued Mr. Sloan, “I propose we postpone further discussion of
this matter</p>
<p>until our next meeting to give ourselves time to develop
dis-agreement and</p>
<p>perhaps gain some understanding of what the decision is all about.”
There are</p>
<p>three reasons why dissent is needed. It first safeguards the decision
maker</p>
<p>against becoming the prisoner of the organization. Every-body is a
special</p>
<p>pleader, trying—often in perfectly good faith—to obtain the decision
he</p>
<p>favors. Second, disagreement alone can provide alterna-tives to a
decision.</p>
<p>And a decision without an alternative is a desperate gambler’s throw,
no</p>
<p>matter how carefully thought through it might be. Above all,
disagreement is</p>
<p>needed to stimulate the imagination.</p>

<p>making, as they have had to make risk-taking decisions on a daily
basis</p>
<p>for thousands of years now. Since there is no such thing as
risk-free</p>
<p>surgery, unnecessary operations must be avoided. The rules used
by</p>
<p>surgeons to make decisions are:</p>
<p>Rule one: In a condition that is likely to cure itself or to
stabilize itself</p>
<p>without risk or danger or great pain to the patient, you put it on
watch</p>
<p>and check regularly. But you don’t cut. To do surgery in such a
condi-</p>
<p>tion is an unnecessary decision.</p>
<p>Rule two: If the condition is degenerative or life-threatening and
there</p>
<p>is something you can do, you do it—fast and radically. It is a
necessary</p>
<p>de-cision despite the risk.</p>
<p>Rule three: This is the problem in between, and it’s probably the</p>
<p>largest single category—the condition that is not degenerative and
not</p>
<p>life-threatening but still not self-correcting and quite serious.
This is</p>
<p>where the surgeon has to weigh opportunity against risk. And it is
this</p>
<p>deci-sion that distinguishes the first-rate surgeon from the
also-ran.</p>

<p>By far the most common mistake is to treat a generic situation</p>
<p>as if it were a series of unique events.</p>
<p>Executives face four basic types of problems:</p>
<p>Generic events that are common within the organization and</p>
<p>throughout the industry</p>
<p>Generic events that are unique for the organization but common</p>
<p>throughout the industry</p>
<p>Truly unique events</p>
<p>Events that appear to be unique but are really the first
appearance</p>
<p>of a new generic problem</p>
<p>All but the truly unique event requires a generic solution. Generic
prob-</p>
<p>lems can be answered with standard rules and practices. Once the
right</p>
<p>principle has been developed, all manifestations of the same generic
event</p>
<p>can be handled by applying the standard principle. All the executive
must</p>
<p>do is adapt the principle to the concrete circumstances of the
specific</p>
<p>prob-lem. Unique events, however, require a unique solution and must
be</p>
<p>treated individually. Truly unique events are quite rare; someone
else has</p>
<p>solved virtually every problem an organization faces already.
Applying a</p>
<p>standard rule or principle can solve most types of problems.</p>

<p>The right answer to the wrong problem is very difficult to fix.</p>
<p>Defining the problem may be the most important element in making
effective</p>
<p>decisions—and the one executives pay the least attention to.</p>
<p>A wrong answer to the right problem can, as a rule, be repaired and
sal-</p>
<p>vaged. But the right answer to the wrong problem, that’s very
difficult to</p>
<p>fix, if only because it’s so difficult to diagnose.</p>
<p>The management of one of America’s largest manufacturing</p>
<p>companies prided itself on its safety record. The company had the
lowest</p>
<p>number of accidents per one thousand employees of any company in
its</p>
<p>industry and one of the very lowest of any manufacturing place in
the</p>
<p>world. Yet its labor union constantly berated it for its horrendous
accident</p>
<p>rate, and so did OSHA. The company thought this a
public-relations</p>
<p>problem and spent large sums of money advertising its near-perfect
safety</p>
<p>record. And yet the union attacks continued. By aggregating all
accidents</p>
<p>and showing them as accidents per thousand workers, the company
did</p>
<p>not see the places where there was a very high accident rate. Once
the</p>
<p>company segregated its acci-dents and reported them in a number
of</p>
<p>categories it found, almost imme-diately, that there was a very
small</p>
<p>number of places, about 3 percent of all units, that had
above-average</p>
<p>accident rates. And an even smaller number of places had very
high</p>
<p>accident rates. But they were the places the union got its complaints
from,</p>
<p>the places whose accidents got into the papers and into OSHA
reports.</p>

<p>If you wait until you have made the decision and then start to “sell”
it,</p>
<p>it’s unlikely to ever become effective.</p>
<p>Unless the organization has “bought” the decision, it will remain</p>
<p>ineffectual; it will remain a good intention. And for a decision to
be ef-</p>
<p>fective, being bought has to be built into it from the start of the
decision-</p>
<p>making process. This is one lesson to learn from Japanese management.
As</p>
<p>soon as it starts the decision-making process, and long before the
final deci-</p>
<p>sion is made, Japanese management sells the decision.</p>
<p>Everyone who is likely to be affected by a decision—say, to go into
a</p>
<p>joint venture with a Western company or to acquire a minority stake
in a</p>
<p>potential U.S. distributor—is asked to write down how such a
decision</p>
<p>would affect his work, job, and unit. He is expressly forbidden to
have an</p>
<p>opinion and to recommend or to object to the possible move. But he is
ex-</p>
<p>pected to think it through. And top management, in turn, then
knows</p>
<p>where each of these people stands. Then top management makes the
deci-</p>
<p>sion from the top down. There isn’t much “participatory management”
in</p>

<p>“Poor Ike. . . . Now . . . he’ll give an order and not a damn

<p>Feedback has to be built into the decision to provide a continuous
test-ing,</p>

<p>Decisions are made by people. People are fallible; at their best,
their works do</p>

The</p>

<p>Feedback from the results of a decision compared against the
expectations when</p>

competent</p>
<p>decision makers.</p>
<p>In no area is it more important than in decision making to build
continu-ous</p>
<p>learning into the executive’s work. And the way to do this is to feed
back from</p>
<p>results of the decision to the expectations when it was being made.
Whenever</p>
<p>executives make an important decision, they put down in writing what
results are</p>
<p>expected and when. And then the executive, nine months or a year
later, begins</p>
<p>to feed back from the actual results to the ex-pected ones and keeps
on doing this</p>
<p>as long as the decision is in force. So in an acquisition, for
example, an executive</p>
<p>compares the actual results to the expected ones for the two to five
years it takes</p>
<p>fully to integrate an ac-</p>
<p>quisition.</p>
<p>It’s amazing how much we learn by doing this and how fast. And</p>
<p>physi-cians have been taught since Hippocrates in Greece 2,400 years
ago</p>
<p>to write down what course they expect a patient’s condition to take
as a</p>
<p>result of the treatment the physician prescribes, that is, as a
result of the</p>
<p>physi-cian’s decision. And that, as every experienced physician will
tell</p>
<p>you, is what makes even moderately endowed doctors into competent</p>
<p>practition-ers within a few years.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-287">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>When you make an important decision, make sure to write</p>
<p>down the expected “prognosis.” Then at a time appropriate for the</p>

<p>Executives should be high enough to have the authority needed</p>
<p>to make the decisions and low enough to have the detailed
knowledge.</p>
<p>There are four basic characteristics that determine the nature of any
business</p>
<p>decision. First, there is the degree of futurity in the decision.</p>
<p>For how long into the future does it commit the company? The
second</p>
<p>cri-terion is the impact a decision has on other functions, on other
areas,</p>
<p>or on the business as a whole. The character of a decision is
also</p>
<p>determined by the number of qualitative factors that enter into it:
basic</p>

and so</p>
<p>on. Finally, deci-sions can be classified according to whether they
are</p>
<p>periodically recurrent or rare, if not unique, decisions.</p>
<p>A decision should always be made at the lowest possible level and as
close</p>
<p>to the scene of action as possible. However, a decision should always
be</p>
<p>made at a level ensuring that all activities and objectives affected
are fully</p>
<p>considered. The first rule tells us how far down a decision should be
made.</p>
<p>The second how far down it can be made, as well as which managers

<p>No society can function as a society unless</p>

<p>Legitimate power stems from the same basic belief of society
regarding</p>
<p>man’s nature and fulfillment on which the individual’s social status
and</p>
<p>function rest. Indeed legitimate power can be defined as rulership
that finds</p>
<p>its justification in the basic ethos of society. In every society
there are many</p>
<p>powers that have nothing to do with such a principle, and
institutions that in</p>
<p>no way are either designed or devoted to its fulfillment. In other

<p>are always a great many “unfree” institutions in a free society, a
great many</p>
<p>inequalities in an equal society, and a great many sinners among the
saints.</p>

based upon</p>
<p>the claim of freedom, equality, or saintliness, and is ex-ercised
through</p>

<p>Capitalism as a social order and as a creed is the expression of the

<p>Capitalism expects the free and equal society to result from the

Cap-italism</p>

means by</p>
<p>which the ideal free and equal society would be automatically
re-alized. All</p>
<p>previous creeds had regarded the profit motive as socially de-</p>
<p>structive, or at least neutral.</p>

<h3 id="purpose-of-government">Purpose of Government</h3>
<p>Every government is a “government of forms.”</p>
<p>Government is a poor manager. It is, of necessity, concerned with</p>
<p>pro-cedure, and it is also, of necessity, large and cumbersome.
Govern-</p>
<p>ment is also properly conscious of the fact that it administers
public funds</p>
<p>and must account for every penny. It has no choice but to be
“bureau-</p>
<p>cratic.” Whether government is a “government of laws” or a
“government</p>
<p>of men” is debatable. But every government is, by definition, a
“govern-</p>
<p>ment of forms.” This means inevitably high costs.</p>
<p>But, the purpose of government is to make fundamental decisions,
and</p>
<p>to make them effectively. The purpose of government is to focus
the</p>
<p>politi-cal energies of society. It is to dramatize issues. It is to
present</p>
<p>fundamental choices. The purpose of government, in other words, is
to</p>
<p>govern. This, as we have learned, in other institutions, is
incompatible</p>
<p>with “doing.” Any attempt to combine governing with “doing” on a
large</p>
<p>scale, paralyzes the decision-making capacity. Business has had to
face,</p>
<p>on a much smaller scale, the problem that modern government now
faces:</p>
<p>the incompatibility between “governing” and “doing.” Business</p>

<p>“Decentralization” applied to government would not be just another
form</p>
<p>of “federalism” in which local rather than central government
discharges the</p>

other, the</p>
<p>nongovernmental institutions of the society of organizations,</p>
<p>for the actual “doing,” that is, for performance, operations,
execution.</p>
<p>Government would start out by asking the question: “How do these
in-</p>
<p>stitutions work and what can they do?” It would then ask: “How
can</p>
<p>politi-cal and social objectives be formulated and organized in such
a</p>
<p>manner as to become opportunities for performance for these</p>
<p>institutions?” It would then ask: “And what opportunities for</p>

weaken</p>

<p>The nonprofit institution needs a fund-development strategy. The
source of</p>
<p>its money is probably the greatest single difference between the
nonprofit</p>

<p>by selling to its customers; the government taxes. The nonprofit</p>

but</p>

<p>A nonprofit institution that becomes a prisoner of money-raising is
in</p>

strategy</p>
<p>for raising money is precisely to enable the nonprofit institution to
carry</p>
<p>out its mission without subordinating that mission to fund-raising.
This is</p>
<p>why nonprofit people have now changed the term they use from
“fund</p>
<p>raising” to “fund development.” Fund development is creating a</p>

<h3 id="strategic-planning">Strategic Planning</h3>
<p>Strategic planning deals with the futurity of present decisions.</p>
<p>Traditional planning asks: “What is most likely to happen?”
Planning</p>
<p>for uncertainty asks, instead: “What has already happened that
will</p>
<p>create the future?”</p>
<p>Strategic planning is not a box of tricks, a bundle of techniques. It
is ana-</p>
<p>lytical thinking and commitment of resources to action. It is the
continu-ous</p>
<p>process of making present entrepreneurial decisions systematically
and with</p>
<p>the greatest knowledge of their futurity, organizing systematically
the efforts</p>
<p>needed to carry out these decisions, and measuring the results of
these</p>
<p>decisions against the expectations through organized, systematic
feed-back.</p>
<p>The question that faces the strategic decision-maker is not what
his</p>
<p>organization should do tomorrow. It is: “What do we have to do today
to be</p>
<p>ready for an uncertain tomorrow?” The question is not what will
happen in</p>
<p>the future. It is: “What futurity do we have to build into our
present think-ing</p>
<p>and doing, what time spans do we have to consider, and how do we use
this</p>
<p>information to make a rational decision now?”</p>

<p>The future will not just happen if one wishes hard enough.</p>
<p>The future requires decisions—now. It imposes risk—now. It requires
action—</p>
<p>now. It demands allocation of resources, and above all, of</p>
<p>human resources—now. It requires work—now.</p>
<p>The idea of long-range planning—and much of its reality—rests on
a</p>
<p>number of misunderstandings. The long range is largely made by
short-run</p>
<p>decisions. Unless the long range is built into, and based on,
short-range plans</p>
<p>and decisions, the most elaborate long-range plan will be an exercise
in</p>
<p>futility. And conversely, unless the short-range plans—that is, the
deci-sions</p>
<p>on the here and now—are integrated into one unified plan of action,
they will</p>
<p>be expedient, guess, and misdirection. “Short range” and “long range”
are not</p>
<p>determined by any given time span. A decision is not short range
because it</p>
<p>takes only a few months to carry it out. What matters is the time
span over</p>
<p>which it is effective. Long-range planning should prevent managers
from</p>
<p>uncritically extending present trends into the future, from assuming
that</p>
<p>today’s products, services, markets, and technologies will be the

<h3 id="the-work-of-the-manager">The Work of the Manager</h3>
<p>Managers can improve their performance by improving</p>
<p>their performance of these constituent activities.</p>
<p>There are five basic operations in the work of the manager.</p>
<p>•Managers, in the first place, set objectives. They determine what
the</p>
<p>objectives should be. They determine what the goals in each area
of</p>
<p>objectives should be. They decide what has to be done to reach</p>
<p>these objectives. They make the objectives effective by</p>
<p>communicating them to the people whose performance is needed to</p>
<p>attain them.</p>
<p>•Second, managers organize. They analyze the activities,</p>
<p>decisions, and relations needed. They classify the work. They</p>
<p>divide it into manageable activities and further divide the</p>
<p>activities into manageable jobs. They group these units and jobs</p>
<p>into an organization structure. They select people for the</p>
<p>management of these units and for the jobs to be done.</p>
<p>•Next, managers motivate and communicate. They make a team out</p>
<p>of the people who are responsible for various jobs.</p>
<p>•The fourth basic element in the work of the manager is</p>
<p>measurement. The manager establishes yardsticks—and few</p>
<p>factors are as important to the performance of the organization
and</p>
<p>of every person in it.</p>
<p>•Finally, managers develop people, including themselves.</p>

<h3 id="management-by-objectives">Management by Objectives</h3>
<p>and Self-Control</p>
<p>“Control” is an ambiguous word.</p>
<p>The greatest advantage of management by objectives is perhaps that
it</p>
<p>makes it possible for a manager to control his own performance.
Self-control</p>
<p>means stronger motivation: a desire to do the best rather than just
enough to</p>
<p>get by. It means higher performance goals and broader vision. Even
if</p>
<p>management by objectives were not necessary to give the enterprise
the unity</p>
<p>of direction and effort of a management team, it would be neces-</p>
<p>sary to make possible management by self-control.</p>
<p>“Control” means the ability to direct oneself and one’s work. It can
also</p>
<p>mean domination of one person by another. Objectives are the basis
of</p>
<p>“control” in the first sense; but they must never become the basis of
“con-</p>
<p>trol” in the second, for this would defeat their purpose. Indeed, one
of the</p>
<p>major contributions of management by objectives is that it enables us
to</p>
<p>substitute management by self-control for management by domination.
It</p>
<p>should be clearly understood what behavior and methods the company
bars as</p>
<p>unethical, unprofessional, or unsound. But within these limits every
manager</p>
<p>must be free to decide what he or she has to do.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-use-objectives">How to Use Objectives</h3>
<p>Objectives are not fate; they are direction.</p>
<p>If objectives are only good intentions, they are worthless. They must
de-</p>
<p>generate into work. And work is always specific, always has—or should
have</p>
<p>—clear, unambiguous, measurable results, a deadline, and a
specific</p>
<p>assignment of accountability. But objectives that become a
straitjacket do</p>
<p>harm. Objectives are always based on expectations. And expectations
are,</p>
<p>at best, informed guesses. The world does not stand still.</p>
<p>The proper way to use objectives is the way an airline uses schedules
and</p>
<p>flight plans. The schedule provides for the 9 AM flight from Los
Ange-les to</p>
<p>get to Boston by 5 PM. But if there is a blizzard in Boston that day,
the plane</p>
<p>will land in Pittsburgh instead and wait out the storm. The flight
plan</p>
<p>provides for flying at thirty thousand feet and for flying over
Denver and</p>
<p>Chicago. But if the pilot encounters turbulence or strong headwinds,
he will</p>
<p>ask flight control for permission to go up another five thousand feet
and to</p>
<p>take the Minneapolis–Montreal route. Yet no flight is ever operated
without a</p>
<p>schedule and flight plan. Any change is immediately fed back to
produce a</p>
<p>new schedule and flight plan. Objectives are not fate; they are
di-rection.</p>
<p>They are not commands; they are commitments. They do not de-termine
the</p>
<p>future; they are a means to mobilize the resources and energies of
the</p>
<p>business for the making of the future.</p>

<p>Setting objectives is so important that some of the most effective

letter” twice</p>
<p>a year. In this letter to his superior, each manager first defines
the ob-jectives</p>

sets down</p>
<p>the performance standards that he believes are being applied to him.
Next, he</p>

within his</p>

he</p>

organizational</p>

the</p>
<p>pioneers were wrong in their assumption that there is—or should
be—</p>
<p>one right organization. Instead of searching for the right

<p>There are some “principles” of organization. One is that organization
has</p>

<p>The most important reason why I am not a quantifier is that in social

<p>fairs, events that matter cannot be quantified. For example, Henry
Ford’s</p>
<p>ignorance in 1900 or 1903 of the prevailing economic wisdom that the
way to</p>
<p>maximize profit was to be a monopolist—that is, to keep pro-duction
low and</p>
<p>prices high—led him to assume that the way to make money was to
keep</p>
<p>prices low and production high. This, the invention of “mass
production,”</p>
<p>totally changed industrial economics. It would have been
impossible,</p>
<p>however, to quantify the impact even as late as 1918 or 1920, years

<p>What the enterprise needs is a principle that gives both the center
and the</p>
<p>parts genuine managerial functions and powers. This principle is
federalism,</p>
<p>in which the whole of the enterprise is conceived as made up</p>
<p>of autonomous units. The federal enterprise and all its units are in
the</p>
<p>same business. The same economic factors determine the future of
the</p>
<p>whole as well as of all units; the same basic decisions have to be
made for</p>
<p>all of them; the same kind and type of executive is needed. Hence
the</p>

the</p>
<p>decision what business the enterprise is in, the organization of the
human</p>
<p>resources, and the selection, training, and testing of future
leaders.</p>
<p>At the same time, each unit is a business by itself. It produces its
own</p>
<p>products for a distinct market. Each unit must, therefore, have
wide</p>
<p>auton-omy within limits set by the general decisions of the

<p>In “federal decentralization” a company is organized into a number of

<p>effort, and skill. Because management by objectives and
self-control</p>
<p>become effective, the number of people or units under one manager is
no</p>
<p>longer limited by the span of control; it is limited only by the much
wider</p>
<p>span of managerial responsibility. The greatest strength of the

Requirements</h3>
<p>As a minimum the unit must contribute a profit to the company</p>
<p>rather than merely contribute to the profit of the company.</p>
<p>Federal decentralization has stringent requirements. Federal
decentral-</p>
<p>ization is applicable only where a company can truly be organized
into a</p>
<p>number of genuine “businesses.” This is its basic limitation. As a
mini-</p>
<p>mum the unit must contribute a profit to the company. And it must be
a</p>
<p>genuine profit determined by the objective judgment of the
marketplace.</p>
<p>Federal decentralization will work only if the top-management job
is</p>
<p>clearly defined and thought through. Federalization, if properly
applied,</p>
<p>makes top management capable of doing its own job precisely because
it does</p>
<p>not have to worry about operations, but can concentrate on direction,
strategy,</p>
<p>objectives, and key decisions for the future. The federal principle
demands</p>
<p>great responsibility from the operating units, the autonomous
busi-nesses.</p>
<p>They are given the maximum of autonomy; and this requires that they
assume</p>
<p>the maximum of responsibility. Federal decentralization requires
centralized</p>
<p>controls and common measurements. Both the managers of the
autonomous</p>
<p>businesses and top management must know what is expected of each</p>
<p>business, what is meant by “performance,” and what developments
are</p>
<p>important. To be able to give autonomy one must have confidence. And
this</p>
<p>requires controls that make opinions unnecessary. A federal unit of a
com-</p>
<p>pany is autonomous, but it is not independent and should not be. Its
auton-</p>
<p>omy is a means toward better performance for the entire company.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-326">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Ensure that executives of your autonomous units have</p>
<p>maximum autonomy and maximum responsibility. Implement this by
es-</p>

<h3 id="reservation-of-authority">Reservation of Authority</h3>
<p>There must be a kind of “supremacy clause” reserving to central</p>
<p>management the decisions that affect the business as a whole and its
long-</p>
<p>range future welfare.</p>
<p>Top management in a decentralized company must think through
care-</p>
<p>fully what decisions it reserves for itself. For there are decisions
that have to</p>
<p>do with the entire company, its integrity, and its future. These
deci-sions can</p>
<p>be made only by somebody who sees the whole and is responsible for
the</p>
<p>whole. Specifically, there must be three reserved areas if the
business is to</p>
<p>remain a whole rather than splinter into fragments. Top management,
and top</p>
<p>management alone, can make the decision on what technologies,
markets, and</p>
<p>products to go into, what businesses to start and what busi-nesses to
abandon,</p>
<p>and also what the basic values, beliefs, and principles of the
company are.</p>
<p>Second, top management must reserve to itself the con-trol of the
allocation</p>
<p>of the key resource of capital. Both the supply of capi-tal and its
investment</p>
<p>are top-management responsibilities that cannot be</p>
<p>turned over to the autonomous units of a federal organization.</p>
<p>Third, the other key resource is people. The people in a federally
orga-</p>
<p>nized company, and especially managers and key professionals, are a
re-</p>
<p>source of the entire company rather than of any one unit. The
company’s</p>
<p>policies with respect to people and decisions on key appointments in
the</p>
<p>decentralized autonomous businesses are top-management decisions—</p>
<p>though of course, autonomous business managers need to take an
active</p>
<p>part in them.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-327">ACTION POINT:</h3>

units</p>
<p>that are not businesses but which are still set up as if they
were</p>
<p>businesses, with maximum possible autonomy, with their own</p>
<p>management, and with at least a “simulation” of profit-and-loss</p>
<p>responsibility. They buy from and sell to each other using
“transfer</p>
<p>prices” determined internally rather than by an outside market. Or
their</p>
<p>“profits” are arrived at by internal allocation of costs to which
then, often,</p>

A</p>
<p>searching analysis is needed that groups activities by the kind of
contribution</p>
<p>they make. There are four major groups of activities, if
distin-guished by their</p>
<p>contribution. First, result-producing activities—that is, activities
that produce</p>
<p>measurable results that can be related, directly or indirectly, to
the results and</p>

have</p>
<p>results only through the use made of their “output” by other

<p>to the results of the business, activi-ties that are truly ancillary.
They are</p>
<p>hygiene and housekeeping activities. Finally, is the top-management
activity.</p>

<h3 id="fundamentals-of-communications">Fundamentals of
Communications</h3>
<p>To improve communications, work not on the utterer but the
recipient.</p>
<p>It is the recipient who communicates. Unless there is someone who
hears,</p>
<p>there is no communication. There is only noise. One can perceive only
what</p>
<p>one is capable of perceiving. One can communicate only in the
recipients’</p>
<p>language or in recipients’/their terms. And the terms have to be
experience-</p>
<p>based. We perceive, as a rule, what we expect to perceive. We see
largely</p>
<p>what we expect to see, and we hear largely what we expect to hear.
The</p>
<p>unexpected is usually not received at all. Communication always
makes</p>
<p>demands. It always demands that the recipient become somebody, do</p>
<p>something, believe something. It always appeals to motivation. If it
goes</p>
<p>against her aspirations, her values, her motivations, it is likely
not to be re-</p>
<p>ceived at all or, at best, to be resisted.</p>
<p>Where communication is perception, information is logic. As such,
in-</p>
<p>formation is purely formal and has no meaning. Information is always
en-</p>
<p>coded. To be received, let alone to be used, the code must be known
and</p>
<p>understood by the recipient. This requires prior agreement, that is,
some</p>
<p>communication.</p>
<h3 id="action-point-330">ACTION POINT:</h3>

<p>Staff work is not done to advance knowledge; its only justification
is the</p>
<p>improvement of the performance of operating people and of the
entire</p>
<p>organization.</p>
<p>First, staff should concentrate on tasks of major importance that
will con-</p>
<p>tinue for many years. A task of major importance that will not last
for-ever—</p>
<p>for example, the reorganization of a company’s management—is
better</p>
<p>handled as a one-time assignment. Staff work should be limited to a
few tasks</p>
<p>of high priority. Proliferation of staff services deprives them of
ef-fectiveness.</p>
<p>Worse, it destroys the effectiveness of the people who produce
results, the</p>
<p>operating people. Unless the number of staff tasks is closely
controlled, staff</p>
<p>will gobble up more and more of operating people’s</p>
<p>scarcest resource: time.</p>
<p>Effective staff work requires specific goals and objectives,
clear</p>
<p>targets, and deadlines. “We expect to cut absenteeism in half within
three</p>
<p>years” or “Two years from now we expect to understand the
segmentation</p>
<p>of our markets sufficiently to reduce the number of product lines by
at</p>
<p>least one third.” Objectives like these make for productive staff
work.</p>
<p>Vague goals such as “getting a handle on employee behavior” or “a
study</p>
<p>of customer motivation” do not. Every three years or so, it is
important to</p>
<p>sit down with every staff unit and ask, “What have you contributed
these</p>
<p>last three years that makes a real difference to this company?”</p>
<h3 id="action-point-331">ACTION POINT:</h3>
<p>Keep support staff small and few. Establish specific goals</p>

<p>one or more organizational goals.</p>

<p>Unless staff people have proved themselves in operations,</p>
<p>they will lack credibility among operating people</p>
<p>and will be dismissed as “theoreticians.”</p>
<p>Rules for staff people are just as important as rules for staff work.
Don’t</p>
<p>ever put anyone into a staff job unless he or she has successfully
held a</p>
<p>number of operating jobs, preferably in more than one functional
area. For if</p>
<p>staff people lack operating experience, they will be arrogant about
opera-</p>
<p>tions, which always look so simple to the “planner.” But today, in
govern-</p>
<p>ment even more than in business, we put young people fresh out of
business</p>
<p>or law school into fairly senior staff jobs as analysts or planners
or staff</p>
<p>counsel. Their arrogance and their rejection by the operating
organi-</p>
<p>zation practically guarantee that they will be totally
unproductive.</p>
<p>With rare exceptions, staff work should not be a person’s “career”
but</p>
<p>only be a part of his or her career. After five to seven years on a
staff job,</p>
<p>people ought to go back into operating work and not return to a

<h3 id="role-of-public-relations">Role of Public Relations</h3>
<p>“Public Relations” has acquired a connotation of ballyhoo,</p>

<p>To the general public, “public relations” means
publicity—essentially</p>
<p>an extension of advertising from advertising a product to advertising
its</p>
<p>producer. But, the emphasis should be on acquainting the broad
public</p>
<p>with the problems of the enterprise rather than on convincing it of
the</p>
<p>company’s virtues and achievements. This leads to the realization
that to</p>
<p>reach the public with its problems, the enterprise must understand
the</p>
<p>public’s problems first.</p>
<p>Every major decision of a great corporation affects the public
somehow, as</p>
<p>workers, consumers, citizens; hence the public will react consciously
or</p>
<p>subconsciously to every move the company makes. On this reaction
de-</p>
<p>pends, however, the effectiveness of the company’s decision—simply
an-</p>
<p>other way of saying that any corporation lives in society. Hence
the</p>
<p>effectiveness of the executive’s decision depends not only on his
under-</p>
<p>standing the problems of his business but also on his understanding
the public</p>
<p>attitude toward his problems. Hence the program of public relations
is to give</p>
<p>both central-office and divisional executives a knowledge of pub-lic
attitudes</p>
<p>and beliefs, and an understanding of the reasons behind them.</p>

<p>don’t automatically fill it. Leave jobs open for six or eight months
and see</p>
<p>what happens; unless there is an overwhelming clamor for filling the
job, then</p>
<p>abolish it. The few companies that have tried this report that about
half the</p>
<p>“vacancies” disappeared after six months. A second way to reduce

one and</p>
<p>only way to provide satisfac-tion and achievement for young managers
and</p>
<p>executives—and for the even younger people working under them—is
to</p>
<p>make jobs bigger, more challenging, more demanding, and more
autonomous,</p>
<p>while increasingly using lateral transfers to different assignments,
rather than</p>
<p>promotions, as a</p>
<p>reward for outstanding performance.</p>

<p>If this change is relevant and meaningful, what opportunities does it

<p>Now as to what the work of the social ecologist is: First of all, it
means</p>
<p>looking at society and community by asking these questions: “What
changes</p>
<p>have already happened that do not fit ‘what everybody knows’?” “What
are</p>
<p>the ‘paradigm changes’?” “Is there any evidence that this is a change
and not</p>
<p>a fad?” And, finally, one then asks: “If this change is rele-</p>
<p>vant and meaningful, what opportunities does it offer?”</p>
<p>A simple example is the emergence of knowledge as a key resource.
The</p>
<p>event that alerted me to the fact that something was happening was
the pas-</p>
<p>sage of the GI Bill of Rights in the United States after the Second
World War.</p>
<p>This law gave every returning war veteran the right to attend
college, with the</p>
<p>government paying the bill. It was a totally unprecedented
devel-opment.</p>
<p>These considerations led me to the question: “What impact does this
have on</p>
<p>expectations, on values, on social structure, on employment, and so
on?” And</p>
<p>once this question was asked—I first asked it in the late 1940s—it
became</p>
<p>clear that knowledge as a productive resource had at-tained a
position in</p>
<p>society as never before in human history. We were clearly on the
threshold of</p>
<p>a major change. Ten years later, by the mid-1950s, one could
confidently talk</p>

<p>The problem is not with technology. It is with mentality.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Western companies have started with costs, put a
desired</p>

pricing. In price-</p>
<p>led costing, the price the customer is willing to pay determines
allow-able</p>
<p>costs, beginning with design costs and ending with service costs.
Mar-keting</p>
<p>provides information on the price the customer is willing to pay
for</p>
<p>the value the product or service provides.</p>
<p>A cross-functional team starts its analysis of costs by taking this
price</p>
<p>as a given. The team then subtracts the profit required to compensate
the</p>

allowable</p>
<p>cost for a product or service. Then it proceeds to make the
tradeoffs</p>
<p>between the utility provided by a product and allowable costs.

<h3 id="activity-costing">Activity Costing</h3>
<p>Activity-based costing is a totally different way of thinking.</p>
<p>Traditional costing techniques are now rapidly being replaced by
activity-</p>
<p>based cost accounting. Traditional costing builds cost from the
bottom up—</p>
<p>labor, material, and overhead. It concentrates primarily</p>
<p>on manufacturing-related costs, the so-called inventoriable
costs.</p>
<p>Activity-based costing starts from the end and asks, “Which
activities and</p>
<p>related costs are used in carrying out the complete value chain
of</p>
<p>activities associ-ated with the cost object?” Activity-based
costing</p>
<p>includes the cost of qual-ity and service.</p>
<p>By designing quality into products and services during the design</p>
<p>stage, design costs may increase, but warranty and service costs are
likely</p>
<p>to de-crease, thus overcoming any cost increase experienced at the
front-</p>
<p>end of the chain. And unlike traditional costing, it includes all
costs of</p>
<p>producing a product or service.</p>

<p>Switching to economic-chain costing requires uniform accounting</p>

<p>The real cost is the cost of an entire process, in which even the
biggest</p>
<p>company is just one link. Companies are therefore beginning to shift
costing</p>
<p>from including only what goes on inside their own organization to
costing the</p>
<p>entire economic process, the economic chain. There are obsta-cles
in</p>
<p>implementing economic-chain costing. For many businesses it will be
painful</p>
<p>to switch to economic-chain costing. Doing so requires uniform or at
least</p>
<p>compatible accounting systems of all businesses along the entire
chain. Yet</p>
<p>each one does its accounting in its own way, and each is con-vinced
that its</p>
<p>system is the only possible one. Moreover, economic-chain costing
requires</p>
<p>information sharing across companies; yet even within the same
company,</p>
<p>people tend to resist information sharing. Whatever the ob-stacles,
economic-</p>

<p>Until a business returns a profit that is greater than its cost of
capital,</p>
<p>it does not create wealth, it destroys it.</p>
<p>Measuring total-factor productivity is one of the major challenges
con-</p>
<p>fronting the executive in the age of knowledge work. For manual
work,</p>
<p>measuring quantity is usually sufficient. In knowledge work, we have
to</p>
<p>manage both quantity and quality, and we do not know yet how to do
that. We</p>
<p>must try to assess total-factor productivity using the common
de-nominator of</p>
<p>revenues and expenses. By measuring the value added over all
costs,</p>
<p>including the cost of capital, EVA (economic value added
analy-sis)</p>
<p>measures, in effect, the productivity of all factors of production
[or the</p>
<p>true economic costs produced by all resources used].</p>
<p>Never mind that a business pays taxes as if it had earned a profit.
It does</p>
<p>not cover its full costs until reported profits exceed its cost of
capital. Until a</p>
<p>business returns a profit that is greater than its cost of capital,
it operates at a</p>
<p>loss. And this is why EVA is growing in popularity. It does not, by
itself, tell</p>
<p>us why a certain product or a certain service does not add value or
what to do</p>
<p>about it. It does show which products, services, operations, or
activities have</p>
<p>unusually high productivity and add unusually high value. Then we
should</p>
<p>ask ourselves, “What can we learn from these successes?”</p>

<p>petitiveness of an enterprise in the global marketplace, but to it we

<p>benchmarking. Benchmarking is a tool that helps a firm tell whether

allocate</p>
<p>human resources as purposefully and as thoughtfully as it allocates

<p>understand a capital investment, a company has to look at four
mea-sures:</p>
<p>return on investment, payback period, cash flow, and discounted
present</p>
<p>value. Each of these four measures tells the executive something
different</p>
<p>about a prospective capital investment. Each looks at the invest-ment
through</p>
<p>a different lens. Decision makers should not evaluate capital
investments in</p>
<p>isolation, but as part of a cluster of projects. They should then
select the</p>
<p>cluster that shows the best ratio between opportunity and risk. The
results of</p>
<p>capital spending should be assessed against expectations in the

<p>The successful acquisition must be based on what the acquirer</p>

<p>The acquirer must be prepared to provide top management to the</p>

Strategy</h3>
<p>“There ain’t no bargains,” and “You get at most what you pay
for.”</p>
<p>Successful acquisitions are based upon business plans, not
financial</p>
<p>analyses. Acquisition targets must fit the business strategies of
the</p>
<p>acquiring company; otherwise, the acquisition is likely to fail. The
worst</p>
<p>acquisition record of the last decades of the twentieth century was
that of</p>
<p>Peter Grace, the longtime CEO of W. R. Grace. He was a brilliant
man.</p>
<p>He set out in the 1950s to build a world-class multinational
through</p>
<p>financially-based acquisitions. He assembled the ablest group of
financial</p>
<p>analysts and had them scout all over the world for industries and
compa-</p>
<p>nies with a low price/earnings ratio. He bought these companies at
what</p>
<p>he thought were bargain prices. The financial analysis of each Grace
pur-</p>
<p>chase was impeccable. But there was absolutely no business
strategy.</p>
<p>By contrast, one of the most successful examples of company
growth</p>

<ol start="2001" type="1">
<li>The largest single cause of the company’s growth in sales and</li>

the</p>
<p>acquisition-based expansion of GE Capital. Of course, not all of
them</p>
<p>panned out. In fact, there was one major failure, the acquisition of

<h3 id="what-the-acquirer-contributes">What the Acquirer
Contributes</h3>
<p>The successful acquisition is based on what the acquiring</p>

<p>An acquisition will succeed only if the acquiring company thinks
through</p>
<p>what it can contribute to the business it is buying, not what the
acquired</p>
<p>company will contribute to the acquirer, no matter how at-</p>
<p>tractive the expected “synergy” may look. What the acquiring
company</p>
<p>contributes may vary. It may be management, technology, or strength
in</p>
<p>distribution. This contribution has to be something besides money.
Money</p>
<p>by itself is never enough.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Citibank by Travelers was successful because
the</p>
<p>ac-quiring company, Travelers, thought through and planned what it
could</p>
<p>contribute to Citibank that would make a major difference. Citibank
had</p>
<p>established itself successfully in practically every country of the
world</p>
<p>and had, at the same time, built a transnational management. But in
its</p>
<p>prod-ucts and services Citibank was still primarily a traditional
bank, and</p>
<p>its dis-tributive and management capacity way exceeded the products
and</p>
<p>services commercial banking can produce and deliver. And Travelers
had</p>
<p>a good many of these products and services. What it saw itself as
being</p>

<p>There has to be a “common culture” or at least a “cultural

<p>Successful diversification by acquisition, like all successful
diversifica-</p>
<p>tion, requires a common core of unity. The two businesses must have
in</p>
<p>common either markets or technology, though occasionally a
comparable</p>
<p>production process has also provided sufficient unity of experience
and ex-</p>
<p>pertise, as well as a common language, to bring companies together.
With-out</p>
<p>such a core of unity, diversification, especially by acquisition,
never</p>
<p>works; financial ties alone are insufficient.</p>
<p>One example is a big French company that has been built by
acquiring</p>
<p>producers of all kinds of luxury goods: champagne and high-fashion
de-</p>
<p>signers, very expensive watches and perfumes and handmade shoes.
It</p>
<p>looks like the worst kind of conglomerate. The products have
seemingly</p>
<p>nothing in common. But all of them are being bought by customers
for</p>
<p>the same reason, which, of course, is not utility or price. Instead,
people</p>
<p>buy them because they are “status.” What all the acquisitions of
this</p>
<p>successful acquirer have in common is their customers’ values.</p>
<p>Champagne is being sold quite differently from high fashion. But it
is</p>
<p>being bought for much the same reason.</p>

<p>The business these people sell is their “child.”</p>
<p>Within a year or so, the acquiring company must be able to provide
top</p>

to</p>
<p>lose the top incumbents in companies that are bought. Top people</p>
<p>are used to being bosses; they don’t want to be “division managers.”
If</p>

<p>they don’t have to stay if they don’t enjoy it. And if they are

<p>This applies particularly to a CEO who originally built the
company</p>

<p>it grew but has been long outgrown by the job. But still, the

<p>benefit calculus. Economics always seeks a different allocation of
the same</p>
<p>resources to obtain a higher yield. In the public-service
institution, there is no</p>
<p>such thing as a higher yield. If one is “doing good,” then there is
no “better.”</p>
<p>Indeed, failure to attain objectives in the quest for a “good”</p>
<p>only means that efforts need to be redoubled.</p>
<p>“Our mission will not be completed,” asserts the head of the
Crusade</p>
<p>Against Hunger, “as long as there is one child on the earth going to
bed</p>
<p>hungry.” If he were to say, “Our mission will be completed if the
largest</p>
<p>pos-sible number of children that can be reached through existing</p>
<p>distribution channels get enough to eat not to be stunted,” he would
be</p>
<p>booted out of of-fice. But if the goal is maximization, it can never
be</p>
<p>attained. Indeed, the closer one comes toward attaining one’s
objective,</p>
<p>the more efforts are called for. For, once optimization has been
reached,</p>
<p>additional costs go up exponentially while additional results fall
off</p>
<p>exponentially. The closer a public-service institution comes to
attaining</p>
<p>its objectives, therefore, the more frustrated it will be and the
harder it</p>
<p>will work on what it is already doing.</p>

<h3 id="the-whistle-blower">The Whistle-blower</h3>
<p>Whistle-blowing is ethically ambiguous.</p>
<p>Today’s ethics of organization debate pays great attention to the
duty</p>
<p>to be a “whistle-blower” and to the protection of the
whistle-blower</p>
<p>against retaliation or suppression by his boss or by his
organization. This</p>
<p>sounds high-minded. Surely, the subordinate has a right, if not
indeed a</p>
<p>duty, to bring to public attention and remedial action his superior’s
mis-</p>
<p>deeds, let alone violation of the law on the part of a superior or of
his em-</p>
<p>ploying organization. But in the context of the ethics of
interdependence,</p>
<p>whistle-blowing is ethically quite ambiguous.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are misdeeds of the superior or of the
employing</p>
<p>orga-nization that so grossly violate propriety and laws that the</p>
<p>subordinate (or the friend, or the child, or even the wife) cannot
remain</p>
<p>silent. This is, after all, what the word “felony” implies; one
becomes a</p>
<p>partner to a felony and criminally liable by not reporting, and
thus</p>
<p>compounding it. But other-wise? It is not primarily that to
encourage</p>
<p>whistle-blowing corrodes that bond of trust that ties the superior to
the</p>
<p>subordinate. Encouraging the whistle-blower must make the
subordinate</p>
<p>lose trust in the superior’s will-ingness and ability to protect
people.</p>

<p>“It is not enough for business to do well; it must also do good.”</p>
<p>But in order to “do good,” a business must first “do well.”</p>
<p>Whenever a business has disregarded the limitation of economic
per-formance</p>
<p>and has assumed social responsibilities that it could not</p>
<p>support economically, it has soon gotten into trouble.</p>
<p>Union Carbide was not socially responsible when it put its plant into
Vi-</p>
<p>enna, West Virginia, to alleviate unemployment there. It was, in
fact, irre-</p>
<p>sponsible. The plant was marginal to begin with. The process was</p>
<p>obsolescent. At best the plant could barely keep its head above
water. And</p>
<p>this, inevitably, meant a plant unable to take on social
responsibility, even for</p>
<p>its own impacts. Because the plant was uneconomical to begin with,
Union</p>
<p>Carbide resisted so long all demands to clean it up. This particular
demand</p>
<p>could not have been foreseen in the late 1940s, when concern with
jobs far</p>
<p>outweighed any concern for the environment. But demands of some kind
can</p>
<p>always be expected. To do something out of social responsi-bility

<p>Society needs a return to spiritual values—not to offset the material

<p>mankind, there is today the promise of material abundance or at least

<h3 id="human-existence-in-tension">Human Existence in Tension</h3>
<p>For Kierkegaard, human existence is possible only in tension— in
tension</p>
<p>between man’s simultaneous life as an individual in the spirit and as
a</p>
<p>citizen in society.</p>
<p>Disintegration of the rational character of society and the rational
rela-tionship</p>
<p>between individual and society is the most revolutionary trait</p>
<p>of our times.</p>
<p>Society must make it possible for man to die without despair if
it</p>
<p>wants him to be able to live exclusively in society. And it can do so
in</p>
<p>only one way: by making individual life meaningless. If you are
nothing</p>
<p>but a leaf on the tree of the race, a cell in the body of society,
then your</p>
<p>death is not re-ally death; you had better call it a process of
collective</p>
<p>regeneration. But then of course your life is not a real life either;
it is just</p>
<p>a functional process within the life of the whole, devoid of any
meaning</p>
<p>except in terms of the whole. Thus an optimism that proclaims
human</p>
<p>existence in society leads straight to despair. And this despair can
lead</p>
<p>only to totalitarianism. Human existence is possible as existence not
in</p>
<p>despair, as existence not in tragedy; it is possible as existence in
Faith.</p>
<p>Faith is the belief that in God the impossible is possible, that in
Him time</p>
<p>and eternity are one, that both life and death are meaningful.</p>

<p>Faith enables man to die; but it also enables him to live.</p>
<p>My work has indeed been totally in society. But I knew at once, in
those</p>
<p>far-back days of 1928, that my life would not and could not be
totally in</p>
<p>society, that it would have to have an existential dimension that
tran-</p>
<p>scends society. Still my work has been totally in society—except for
this</p>
<p>essay on Kierkegaard.</p>
<p>Though Kierkegaard’s faith cannot overcome the awful loneliness,
the</p>
<p>isolation and dissonance of human existence, it can make it bearable
by</p>
<p>making it meaningful. The philosophy of the totalitarian creeds
enables</p>
<p>man to die. It is dangerous to underestimate the strength of such
a</p>
<p>philoso-phy; for, in a time of sorrow and suffering, of catastrophe
and</p>
<p>horror, it is a great thing to be able to die. Yet it is not
enough.</p>
<p>Kierkegaard’s faith, too, enables man to die; but it also enables him
to</p>
<p>live. Faith is the belief that in God the impossible is possible,
that in Him</p>
<p>time and eternity are one, that both life and death are meaningful.
Faith is</p>
<p>the knowledge that man is creature—not autonomous, not the master,
not</p>
<p>the end, not the center— and yet responsible and free. It is the
acceptance</p>
<p>of man’s essential loneli-ness, to be overcome by the certainty that

<p>And family management is by no means confined to small and
medium-sized</p>
<p>firms—families run some of the world’s largest companies. DuPont,</p>

<p>The controlling word in “family-managed business” is not

<p>It has to be “business.”</p>
<p>The first rule is that family members do not work in the business
unless</p>
<p>they are at least as able as any nonfamily employee, and work at
least as hard.</p>
<p>The second rule is equally simple: No matter how many family mem-bers
are</p>
<p>in the company’s management, and how effective they are, one top job
is</p>
<p>always filled by an outsider who is not a member of the family.
Typi-cally,</p>
<p>this is either the financial executive or the head of research—the
two</p>
<p>positions in which technical qualifications are most important. Rule
three is</p>
<p>that family-managed businesses, except perhaps for the very smallest
ones,</p>
<p>increasingly need to staff key positions with nonfamily
professionals. The</p>
<p>knowledge and expertise needed, whether in manufacturing or in
marketing,</p>
<p>in finance, in research, in human resource management, have become
far too</p>
<p>great to be satisfied by any but the most competent family</p>
<p>member.</p>
<p>Even the family-managed business that faithfully observes the
preceding</p>
<p>three rules tends to get into trouble—and often breaks up—over
manage-</p>
<p>ment succession. Then what the business needs and what the family
